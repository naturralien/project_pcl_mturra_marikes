+Chapter 3
+
+When I had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that I
+
+should become a student at the university of Ingolstadt. I had
+
+hitherto attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought it
+
+necessary for the completion of my education that I should be made
+
+acquainted with other customs than those of my native country. My
+
+departure was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the day
+
+resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life
+
+occurred�an omen, as it were, of my future misery.
+
+Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was
+
+in the greatest danger. During her illness many arguments had been urged to
+
+persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her. She had at first
+
+yielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of her
+
+favourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety. She
+
+attended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity
+
+of the distemper�Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this
+
+imprudence were fatal to her preserver. On the third day my mother
+
+sickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the
+
+looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event. On her
+
+deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert
+
+her. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself. �My
+
+children,� she said, �my firmest hopes of future happiness were
+
+placed on the prospect of your union. This expectation will now be the
+
+consolation of your father. Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to
+
+my younger children. Alas! I regret that I am taken from you; and, happy
+
+and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all? But these are
+
+not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to
+
+death and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.�
+
+She died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death.
+
+I need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent
+
+by that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the
+
+soul, and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance. It is so
+
+long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day
+
+and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed
+
+for ever�that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been
+
+extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear
+
+can be hushed, never more to be heard. These are the reflections of
+
+the first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the
+
+evil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences. Yet from whom has
+
+not that rude hand rent away some dear connection? And why should I
+
+describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel? The time at
+
+length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and
+
+the smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a
+
+sacrilege, is not banished. My mother was dead, but we had still
+
+duties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course with the
+
+rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the
+
+spoiler has not seized.
+
+My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events,
+
+was now again determined upon. I obtained from my father a respite of
+
+some weeks. It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose,
+
+akin to death, of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of
+
+life. I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me. I was
+
+unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me, and above
+
+all, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled.
+
+She indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all.
+
+She looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and
+
+zeal. She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call
+
+her uncle and cousins. Never was she so enchanting as at this time,
+
+when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us.
+
+She forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget.
+
+The day of my departure at length arrived. Clerval spent the last
+
+evening with us. He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit
+
+him to accompany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain. His
+
+father was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the
+
+aspirations and ambition of his son. Henry deeply felt the misfortune
+
+of being debarred from a liberal education. He said little, but when
+
+he spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a
+
+restrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details
+
+of commerce.
+
+We sat late. We could not tear ourselves away from each other nor
+
+persuade ourselves to say the word �Farewell!� It was said, and we
+
+retired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the
+
+other was deceived; but when at morning�s dawn I descended to the
+
+carriage which was to convey me away, they were all there�my father
+
+again to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to
+
+renew her entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the last
+
+feminine attentions on her playmate and friend.
+
+I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in
+
+the most melancholy reflections. I, who had ever been surrounded by
+
+amiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual
+
+pleasure�I was now alone. In the university whither I was going I
+
+must form my own friends and be my own protector. My life had hitherto
+
+been remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible
+
+repugnance to new countenances. I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and
+
+Clerval; these were �old familiar faces,� but I believed myself
+
+totally unfitted for the company of strangers. Such were my reflections as
+
+I commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. I
+
+ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge. I had often, when at home,
+
+thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had
+
+longed to enter the world and take my station among other human beings. 
+
+Now my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to
+
+repent.
+
+I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my
+
+journey to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing. At length the
+
+high white steeple of the town met my eyes. I alighted and was
+
+conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as I pleased.
+
+The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to
+
+some of the principal professors. Chance�or rather the evil
+
+influence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me
+
+from the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father�s
+
+door�led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy. He
+
+was an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science. He
+
+asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches
+
+of science appertaining to natural philosophy. I replied carelessly, and
+
+partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal
+
+authors I had studied. The professor stared. �Have you,� he
+
+said, �really spent your time in studying such nonsense?�
+
+I replied in the affirmative. �Every minute,� continued M. Krempe with
+
+warmth, �every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly
+
+and entirely lost. You have burdened your memory with exploded systems
+
+and useless names. Good God! In what desert land have you lived,
+
+where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you
+
+have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they
+
+are ancient? I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific
+
+age, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dear
+
+sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.�
+
+So saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books
+
+treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and
+
+dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following
+
+week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural
+
+philosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow
+
+professor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he
+
+omitted.
+
+I returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long
+
+considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I
+
+returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any
+
+shape. M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a
+
+repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in
+
+favour of his pursuits. In rather a too philosophical and connected a
+
+strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come
+
+to concerning them in my early years. As a child I had not been
+
+content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural
+
+science. With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my
+
+extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the
+
+steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the
+
+discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists.
+
+Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy.
+
+It was very different when the masters of the science sought
+
+immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now
+
+the scene was changed. The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit
+
+itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in
+
+science was chiefly founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of
+
+boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.
+
+Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my
+
+residence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming
+
+acquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new
+
+abode. But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information
+
+which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures. And although I
+
+could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver
+
+sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M.
+
+Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.
+
+Partly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing
+
+room, which M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was very
+
+unlike his colleague. He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an
+
+aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his
+
+temples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black. His person
+
+was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard.
+
+He began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and
+
+the various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing
+
+with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers. He then took
+
+a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of
+
+its elementary terms. After having made a few preparatory experiments, he
+
+concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I
+
+shall never forget:
+
+�The ancient teachers of this science,� said he,
+
+�promised impossibilities and performed nothing. The modern masters
+
+promise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that
+
+the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seem
+
+only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or
+
+crucible, have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into the recesses
+
+of nature and show how she works in her hiding-places. They ascend into the
+
+heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of
+
+the air we breathe. They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers;
+
+they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even
+
+mock the invisible world with its own shadows.�
+
+Such were the professor�s words�rather let me say such the words of
+
+the fate�enounced to destroy me. As he went on I felt as if my soul
+
+were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were
+
+touched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was
+
+sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception,
+
+one purpose. So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of
+
+Frankenstein�more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps
+
+already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and
+
+unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.
+
+I closed not my eyes that night. My internal being was in a state of
+
+insurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I
+
+had no power to produce it. By degrees, after the morning�s dawn,
+
+sleep came. I awoke, and my yesternight�s thoughts were as a dream.
+
+There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to
+
+devote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a
+
+natural talent. On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit. His
+
+manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public,
+
+for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in
+
+his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness. I
+
+gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had
+
+given to his fellow professor. He heard with attention the little
+
+narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius
+
+Agrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had
+
+exhibited. He said that �These were men to whose indefatigable zeal
+
+modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their
+
+knowledge. They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names
+
+and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a
+
+great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. The
+
+labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever
+
+fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.� I
+
+listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption
+
+or affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my
+
+prejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured
+
+terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his
+
+instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have
+
+made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended
+
+labours. I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to
+
+procure.
+
+�I am happy,� said M. Waldman, �to have gained a
+
+disciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt of
+
+your success. Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the
+
+greatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that
+
+I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have not
+
+neglected the other branches of science. A man would make but a very sorry
+
+chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone. If your
+
+wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty
+
+experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural
+
+philosophy, including mathematics.�
+
+He then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his
+
+various machines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure and
+
+promising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in
+
+the science not to derange their mechanism. He also gave me the list of
+
+books which I had requested, and I took my leave.
+
+Thus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.

Bistritz._--Left Munich at 8:35 P. M., on 1st May, arriving atVienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was anhour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which Igot of it from the train and the little I could walk through thestreets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrivedlate and would start as near the correct time as possible. Theimpression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering theEast; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which ishere of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkishrule.We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh.Here I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, orrather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which wasvery good but thirsty. (_Mem._, get recipe for Mina.) I asked thewaiter, and he said it was called “paprika hendl,” and that, as it was anational dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along theCarpathians. I found my smattering of German very useful here; indeed, Idon’t know how I should be able to get on without it.Having had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited theBritish Museum, and made search among the books and maps in the libraryregarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of thecountry could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with anobleman of that country. I find that the district he named is in theextreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states,Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathianmountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe. I wasnot able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of theCastle Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to comparewith our own Ordnance Survey maps; but I found that Bistritz, the posttown named by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place. I shall enterhere some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over mytravels with Mina.In the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities:Saxons in the South, and mixed with them the Wallachs, who are thedescendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in theEast and North. I am going among the latter, who claim to be descendedfrom Attila and the Huns. This may be so, for when the Magyars conqueredthe country in the eleventh century they found the Huns settled in it. Iread that every known superstition in the world is gathered into thehorseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort ofimaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting. (_Mem._, Imust ask the Count all about them.)I did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough, for I hadall sorts of queer dreams. There was a dog howling all night under mywindow, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have beenthe paprika, for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe, and wasstill thirsty. Towards morning I slept and was wakened by the continuousknocking at my door, so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then.I had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flourwhich they said was “mamaliga,” and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, avery excellent dish, which they call “impletata.” (_Mem._, get recipefor this also.) I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a littlebefore eight, or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing tothe station at 7:30 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hourbefore we began to move. It seems to me that the further east you go themore unpunctual are the trains. What ought they to be in China?All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full ofbeauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on thetop of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran byrivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each sideof them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, andrunning strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear. At everystation there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sortsof attire. Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those Isaw coming through France and Germany, with short jackets and round hatsand home-made trousers; but others were very picturesque. The womenlooked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsyabout the waist. They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other,and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of somethingfluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course therewere petticoats under them. The strangest figures we saw were theSlovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boyhats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormousheavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brassnails. They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, andhad long black hair and heavy black moustaches. They are verypicturesque, but do not look prepossessing. On the stage they would beset down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands. They are,however, I am told, very harmless and rather wanting in naturalself-assertion.It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is avery interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier--for theBorgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina--it has had a very stormyexistence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a seriesof great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separateoccasions. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwenta siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of warproper being assisted by famine and disease.Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which Ifound, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for ofcourse I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I wasevidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced acheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress--whiteundergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stufffitting almost too tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed andsaid, “The Herr Englishman?” “Yes,” I said, “Jonathan Harker.” Shesmiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves,who had followed her to the door. He went, but immediately returned witha letter:--“My Friend.--Welcome to the Carpathians. I am anxiously expectingyou. Sleep well to-night. At three to-morrow the diligence willstart for Bukovina; a place on it is kept for you. At the BorgoPass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me. I trustthat your journey from London has been a happy one, and that youwill enjoy your stay in my beautiful land.“Your friend,“DRACULA.”_4 May._--I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count,directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me; but onmaking inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent, andpretended that he could not understand my German. This could not betrue, because up to then he had understood it perfectly; at least, heanswered my questions exactly as if he did. He and his wife, the oldlady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort ofway. He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter, and thatwas all he knew. When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, and couldtell me anything of his castle, both he and his wife crossed themselves,and, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speakfurther. It was so near the time of starting that I had no time to askany one else, for it was all very mysterious and not by any meanscomforting.Just before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said in avery hysterical way:“Must you go? Oh! young Herr, must you go?” She was in such an excitedstate that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew, andmixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at all. Iwas just able to follow her by asking many questions. When I told herthat I must go at once, and that I was engaged on important business,she asked again:“Do you know what day it is?” I answered that it was the fourth of May.She shook her head as she said again:“Oh, yes! I know that! I know that, but do you know what day it is?” Onmy saying that I did not understand, she went on:“It is the eve of St. George’s Day. Do you not know that to-night, whenthe clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will havefull sway? Do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?”She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, butwithout effect. Finally she went down on her knees and implored me notto go; at least to wait a day or two before starting. It was all veryridiculous but I did not feel comfortable. However, there was businessto be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. I thereforetried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thankedher, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go. She then rose anddried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me. Idid not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have beentaught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet itseemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such astate of mind. She saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put therosary round my neck, and said, “For your mother’s sake,” and went outof the room. I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waitingfor the coach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is stillround my neck. Whether it is the old lady’s fear, or the many ghostlytraditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know, but Iam not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual. If this book shouldever reach Mina before I do, let it bring my good-bye. Here comes thecoach!*       *       *       *       *_5 May. The Castle._--The grey of the morning has passed, and the sun ishigh over the distant horizon, which seems jagged, whether with trees orhills I know not, for it is so far off that big things and little aremixed. I am not sleepy, and, as I am not to be called till I awake,naturally I write till sleep comes. There are many odd things to putdown, and, lest who reads them may fancy that I dined too well before Ileft Bistritz, let me put down my dinner exactly. I dined on what theycalled “robber steak”--bits of bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned with redpepper, and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire, in the simplestyle of the London cat’s meat! The wine was Golden Mediasch, whichproduces a queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, notdisagreeable. I had only a couple of glasses of this, and nothing else.When I got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat, and I saw himtalking with the landlady. They were evidently talking of me, for everynow and then they looked at me, and some of the people who were sittingon the bench outside the door--which they call by a name meaning“word-bearer”--came and listened, and then looked at me, most of thempityingly. I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, forthere were many nationalities in the crowd; so I quietly got my polyglotdictionary from my bag and looked them out. I must say they were notcheering to me, for amongst them were “Ordog”--Satan, “pokol”--hell,“stregoica”--witch, “vrolok” and “vlkoslak”--both of which mean the samething, one being Slovak and the other Servian for something that iseither were-wolf or vampire. (_Mem._, I must ask the Count about thesesuperstitions)When we started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this timeswelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross andpointed two fingers towards me. With some difficulty I got afellow-passenger to tell me what they meant; he would not answer atfirst, but on learning that I was English, he explained that it was acharm or guard against the evil eye. This was not very pleasant for me,just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man; but every oneseemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that Icould not but be touched. I shall never forget the last glimpse which Ihad of the inn-yard and its crowd of picturesque figures, all crossingthemselves, as they stood round the wide archway, with its background ofrich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in thecentre of the yard. Then our driver, whose wide linen drawers coveredthe whole front of the box-seat--“gotza” they call them--cracked his bigwhip over his four small horses, which ran abreast, and we set off onour journey.I soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of thescene as we drove along, although had I known the language, or ratherlanguages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, I might not havebeen able to throw them off so easily. Before us lay a green slopingland full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crownedwith clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to theroad. There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom--apple,plum, pear, cherry; and as we drove by I could see the green grass underthe trees spangled with the fallen petals. In and out amongst thesegreen hills of what they call here the “Mittel Land” ran the road,losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by thestraggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down thehillsides like tongues of flame. The road was rugged, but still weseemed to fly over it with a feverish haste. I could not understand thenwhat the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing notime in reaching Borgo Prund. I was told that this road is in summertimeexcellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the wintersnows. In this respect it is different from the general run of roads inthe Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be keptin too good order. Of old the Hospadars would not repair them, lest theTurk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops,and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point.Beyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopesof forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves. Rightand left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full uponthem and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range,deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown wheregrass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock andpointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, wherethe snowy peaks rose grandly. Here and there seemed mighty rifts in themountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and againthe white gleam of falling water. One of my companions touched my arm aswe swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty, snow-coveredpeak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, tobe right before us:--“Look! Isten szek!”--“God’s seat!”--and he crossed himself reverently.As we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behindus, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us. This wasemphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held thesunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink. Here and therewe passed Cszeks and Slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I noticedthat goitre was painfully prevalent. By the roadside were many crosses,and as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves. Here and therewas a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did not eventurn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender ofdevotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. There weremany things new to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and hereand there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stemsshining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves. Now andagain we passed a leiter-wagon--the ordinary peasant’s cart--with itslong, snake-like vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of theroad. On this were sure to be seated quite a group of home-comingpeasants, the Cszeks with their white, and the Slovaks with theircoloured, sheepskins, the latter carrying lance-fashion their longstaves, with axe at end. As the evening fell it began to get very cold,and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness thegloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys whichran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through thePass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background oflate-lying snow. Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woodsthat seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses ofgreyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced apeculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts andgrim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunsetthrew into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst theCarpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys. Sometimes thehills were so steep that, despite our driver’s haste, the horses couldonly go slowly. I wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home,but the driver would not hear of it. “No, no,” he said; “you must notwalk here; the dogs are too fierce”; and then he added, with what heevidently meant for grim pleasantry--for he looked round to catch theapproving smile of the rest--“and you may have enough of such mattersbefore you go to sleep.” The only stop he would make was a moment’spause to light his lamps.When it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst thepassengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, asthough urging him to further speed. He lashed the horses unmercifullywith his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them onto further exertions. Then through the darkness I could see a sort ofpatch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in thehills. The excitement of the passengers grew greater; the crazy coachrocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on astormy sea. I had to hold on. The road grew more level, and we appearedto fly along. Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on eachside and to frown down upon us; we were entering on the Borgo Pass. Oneby one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressedupon me with an earnestness which would take no denial; these werecertainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple goodfaith, with a kindly word, and a blessing, and that strange mixture offear-meaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel atBistritz--the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye.Then, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side thepassengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into thedarkness. It was evident that something very exciting was eitherhappening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one wouldgive me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on forsome little time; and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out onthe eastern side. There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in theair the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder. It seemed as though themountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had gotinto the thunderous one. I was now myself looking out for the conveyancewhich was to take me to the Count. Each moment I expected to see theglare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark. The only lightwas the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from ourhard-driven horses rose in a white cloud. We could see now the sandyroad lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle.The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mockmy own disappointment. I was already thinking what I had best do, whenthe driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which Icould hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone; Ithought it was “An hour less than the time.” Then turning to me, he saidin German worse than my own:--“There is no carriage here. The Herr is not expected after all. He willnow come on to Bukovina, and return to-morrow or the next day; betterthe next day.” Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh andsnort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up. Then,amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossingof themselves, a calèche, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtookus, and drew up beside the coach. I could see from the flash of ourlamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses were coal-black andsplendid animals. They were driven by a tall man, with a long brownbeard and a great black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us. Icould only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed redin the lamplight, as he turned to us. He said to the driver:--“You are early to-night, my friend.” The man stammered in reply:--“The English Herr was in a hurry,” to which the stranger replied:--“That is why, I suppose, you wished him to go on to Bukovina. You cannotdeceive me, my friend; I know too much, and my horses are swift.” As hespoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, withvery red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory. One of mycompanions whispered to another the line from Burger’s “Lenore”:--“Denn die Todten reiten schnell”--(“For the dead travel fast.”)The strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with agleaming smile. The passenger turned his face away, at the same timeputting out his two fingers and crossing himself. “Give me the Herr’sluggage,” said the driver; and with exceeding alacrity my bags werehanded out and put in the calèche. Then I descended from the side of thecoach, as the calèche was close alongside, the driver helping me with ahand which caught my arm in a grip of steel; his strength must have beenprodigious. Without a word he shook his reins, the horses turned, and weswept into the darkness of the Pass. As I looked back I saw the steamfrom the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projectedagainst it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves. Thenthe driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off they swepton their way to Bukovina. As they sank into the darkness I felt astrange chill, and a lonely feeling came over me; but a cloak was thrownover my shoulders, and a rug across my knees, and the driver said inexcellent German:--“The night is chill, mein Herr, and my master the Count bade me take allcare of you. There is a flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of thecountry) underneath the seat, if you should require it.” I did not takeany, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same. I felt alittle strangely, and not a little frightened. I think had there beenany alternative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting thatunknown night journey. The carriage went at a hard pace straight along,then we made a complete turn and went along another straight road. Itseemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same groundagain; and so I took note of some salient point, and found that this wasso. I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, butI really feared to do so, for I thought that, placed as I was, anyprotest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention todelay. By-and-by, however, as I was curious to know how time waspassing, I struck a match, and by its flame looked at my watch; it waswithin a few minutes of midnight. This gave me a sort of shock, for Isuppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by myrecent experiences. I waited with a sick feeling of suspense.Then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road--along, agonised wailing, as if from fear. The sound was taken up byanother dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind whichnow sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemedto come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could graspit through the gloom of the night. At the first howl the horses began tostrain and rear, but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and theyquieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway fromsudden fright. Then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on eachside of us began a louder and a sharper howling--that of wolves--whichaffected both the horses and myself in the same way--for I was minded tojump from the calèche and run, whilst they reared again and plungedmadly, so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep themfrom bolting. In a few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed tothe sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was ableto descend and to stand before them. He petted and soothed them, andwhispered something in their ears, as I have heard of horse-tamersdoing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they becamequite manageable again, though they still trembled. The driver againtook his seat, and shaking his reins, started off at a great pace. Thistime, after going to the far side of the Pass, he suddenly turned down anarrow roadway which ran sharply to the right.Soon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over theroadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great frowningrocks guarded us boldly on either side. Though we were in shelter, wecould hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through therocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along.It grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall,so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket. Thekeen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grewfainter as we went on our way. The baying of the wolves sounded nearerand nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. Igrew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver,however, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head toleft and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.Suddenly, away on our left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame. Thedriver saw it at the same moment; he at once checked the horses, and,jumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness. I did not knowwhat to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer; but whileI wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word tookhis seat, and we resumed our journey. I think I must have fallen asleepand kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be repeatedendlessly, and now looking back, it is like a sort of awful nightmare.Once the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darknessaround us I could watch the driver’s motions. He went rapidly to wherethe blue flame arose--it must have been very faint, for it did not seemto illumine the place around it at all--and gathering a few stones,formed them into some device. Once there appeared a strange opticaleffect: when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it,for I could see its ghostly flicker all the same. This startled me, butas the effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes deceived mestraining through the darkness. Then for a time there were no blueflames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of thewolves around us, as though they were following in a moving circle.At last there came a time when the driver went further afield than hehad yet gone, and during his absence, the horses began to tremble worsethan ever and to snort and scream with fright. I could not see any causefor it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether; but justthen the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind thejagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light I sawaround us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues,with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair. They were a hundred times moreterrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled.For myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear. It is only when a manfeels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understandtheir true import.All at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had hadsome peculiar effect on them. The horses jumped about and reared, andlooked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see;but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side; and theyhad perforce to remain within it. I called to the coachman to come, forit seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through thering and to aid his approach. I shouted and beat the side of thecalèche, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so asto give him a chance of reaching the trap. How he came there, I knownot, but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command, andlooking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway. As he swept hislong arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolvesfell back and back further still. Just then a heavy cloud passed acrossthe face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness.When I could see again the driver was climbing into the calèche, and thewolves had disappeared. This was all so strange and uncanny that adreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak or move. The timeseemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost completedarkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon. We kept onascending, with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the mainalways ascending. Suddenly, I became conscious of the fact that thedriver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of avast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light,and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlitsky.CHAPTER IIJONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL--_continued__5 May._--I must have been asleep, for certainly if I had been fullyawake I must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place. Inthe gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as several darkways led from it under great round arches, it perhaps seemed bigger thanit really is. I have not yet been able to see it by daylight.When the calèche stopped, the driver jumped down and held out his handto assist me to alight. Again I could not but notice his prodigiousstrength. His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could havecrushed mine if he had chosen. Then he took out my traps, and placedthem on the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door, old andstudded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway ofmassive stone. I could see even in the dim light that the stone wasmassively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time andweather. As I stood, the driver jumped again into his seat and shook thereins; the horses started forward, and trap and all disappeared down oneof the dark openings.I stood in silence where I was, for I did not know what to do. Of bellor knocker there was no sign; through these frowning walls and darkwindow openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate. Thetime I waited seemed endless, and I felt doubts and fears crowding uponme. What sort of place had I come to, and among what kind of people?What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked? Was this acustomary incident in the life of a solicitor’s clerk sent out toexplain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner? Solicitor’sclerk! Mina would not like that. Solicitor--for just before leavingLondon I got word that my examination was successful; and I am now afull-blown solicitor! I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see ifI were awake. It all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me, and Iexpected that I should suddenly awake, and find myself at home, withthe dawn struggling in through the windows, as I had now and again feltin the morning after a day of overwork. But my flesh answered thepinching test, and my eyes were not to be deceived. I was indeed awakeand among the Carpathians. All I could do now was to be patient, and towait the coming of the morning.Just as I had come to this conclusion I heard a heavy step approachingbehind the great door, and saw through the chinks the gleam of a cominglight. Then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking ofmassive bolts drawn back. A key was turned with the loud grating noiseof long disuse, and the great door swung back.Within, stood a tall old man, clean shaven save for a long whitemoustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speckof colour about him anywhere. He held in his hand an antique silverlamp, in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind,throwing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of theopen door. The old man motioned me in with his right hand with a courtlygesture, saying in excellent English, but with a strange intonation:--“Welcome to my house! Enter freely and of your own will!” He made nomotion of stepping to meet me, but stood like a statue, as though hisgesture of welcome had fixed him into stone. The instant, however, thatI had stepped over the threshold, he moved impulsively forward, andholding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince,an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold asice--more like the hand of a dead than a living man. Again he said:--“Welcome to my house. Come freely. Go safely; and leave something of thehappiness you bring!” The strength of the handshake was so much akin tothat which I had noticed in the driver, whose face I had not seen, thatfor a moment I doubted if it were not the same person to whom I wasspeaking; so to make sure, I said interrogatively:--“Count Dracula?” He bowed in a courtly way as he replied:--“I am Dracula; and I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house. Come in;the night air is chill, and you must need to eat and rest.” As he wasspeaking, he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall, and stepping out,took my luggage; he had carried it in before I could forestall him. Iprotested but he insisted:--“Nay, sir, you are my guest. It is late, and my people are notavailable. Let me see to your comfort myself.” He insisted on carryingmy traps along the passage, and then up a great winding stair, andalong another great passage, on whose stone floor our steps rangheavily. At the end of this he threw open a heavy door, and I rejoicedto see within a well-lit room in which a table was spread for supper,and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly replenished,flamed and flared.The Count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossingthe room, opened another door, which led into a small octagonal room litby a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort. Passingthrough this, he opened another door, and motioned me to enter. It was awelcome sight; for here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed withanother log fire,--also added to but lately, for the top logs werefresh--which sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney. The Count himselfleft my luggage inside and withdrew, saying, before he closed thedoor:--“You will need, after your journey, to refresh yourself by making yourtoilet. I trust you will find all you wish. When you are ready, comeinto the other room, where you will find your supper prepared.”The light and warmth and the Count’s courteous welcome seemed to havedissipated all my doubts and fears. Having then reached my normal state,I discovered that I was half famished with hunger; so making a hastytoilet, I went into the other room.I found supper already laid out. My host, who stood on one side of thegreat fireplace, leaning against the stonework, made a graceful wave ofhis hand to the table, and said:--“I pray you, be seated and sup how you please. You will, I trust, excuseme that I do not join you; but I have dined already, and I do not sup.”I handed to him the sealed letter which Mr. Hawkins had entrusted to me.He opened it and read it gravely; then, with a charming smile, he handedit to me to read. One passage of it, at least, gave me a thrill ofpleasure.“I must regret that an attack of gout, from which malady I am a constantsufferer, forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time tocome; but I am happy to say I can send a sufficient substitute, one inwhom I have every possible confidence. He is a young man, full of energyand talent in his own way, and of a very faithful disposition. He isdiscreet and silent, and has grown into manhood in my service. He shallbe ready to attend on you when you will during his stay, and shall takeyour instructions in all matters.”The Count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish, and Ifell to at once on an excellent roast chicken. This, with some cheeseand a salad and a bottle of old Tokay, of which I had two glasses, wasmy supper. During the time I was eating it the Count asked me manyquestions as to my journey, and I told him by degrees all I hadexperienced.By this time I had finished my supper, and by my host’s desire had drawnup a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me,at the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke. I had now anopportunity of observing him, and found him of a very markedphysiognomy.His face was a strong--a very strong--aquiline, with high bridge of thethin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils; with lofty domed forehead, andhair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere. Hiseyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushyhair that seemed to curl in its own profusion. The mouth, so far as Icould see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rathercruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth; these protruded overthe lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in aman of his years. For the rest, his ears were pale, and at the topsextremely pointed; the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firmthough thin. The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor.Hitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his kneesin the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine; but seeingthem now close to me, I could not but notice that they were rathercoarse--broad, with squat fingers. Strange to say, there were hairs inthe centre of the palm. The nails were long and fine, and cut to a sharppoint. As the Count leaned over me and his hands touched me, I could notrepress a shudder. It may have been that his breath was rank, but ahorrible feeling of nausea came over me, which, do what I would, I couldnot conceal. The Count, evidently noticing it, drew back; and with agrim sort of smile, which showed more than he had yet done hisprotuberant teeth, sat himself down again on his own side of thefireplace. We were both silent for a while; and as I looked towards thewindow I saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn. There seemed astrange stillness over everything; but as I listened I heard as if fromdown below in the valley the howling of many wolves. The Count’s eyesgleamed, and he said:--“Listen to them--the children of the night. What music they make!”Seeing, I suppose, some expression in my face strange to him, headded:--“Ah, sir, you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of thehunter.” Then he rose and said:--“But you must be tired. Your bedroom is all ready, and to-morrow youshall sleep as late as you will. I have to be away till the afternoon;so sleep well and dream well!” With a courteous bow, he opened for mehimself the door to the octagonal room, and I entered my bedroom....I am all in a sea of wonders. I doubt; I fear; I think strange things,which I dare not confess to my own soul. God keep me, if only for thesake of those dear to me!*       *       *       *       *_7 May._--It is again early morning, but I have rested and enjoyed thelast twenty-four hours. I slept till late in the day, and awoke of myown accord. When I had dressed myself I went into the room where we hadsupped, and found a cold breakfast laid out, with coffee kept hot by thepot being placed on the hearth. There was a card on the table, on whichwas written:--“I have to be absent for a while. Do not wait for me.--D.” I set to andenjoyed a hearty meal. When I had done, I looked for a bell, so that Imight let the servants know I had finished; but I could not find one.There are certainly odd deficiencies in the house, considering theextraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me. The table serviceis of gold, and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense value.The curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings ofmy bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics, and must havebeen of fabulous value when they were made, for they are centuries old,though in excellent order. I saw something like them in Hampton Court,but there they were worn and frayed and moth-eaten. But still in none ofthe rooms is there a mirror. There is not even a toilet glass on mytable, and I had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before Icould either shave or brush my hair. I have not yet seen a servantanywhere, or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves.Some time after I had finished my meal--I do not know whether to call itbreakfast or dinner, for it was between five and six o’clock when I hadit--I looked about for something to read, for I did not like to go aboutthe castle until I had asked the Count’s permission. There wasabsolutely nothing in the room, book, newspaper, or even writingmaterials; so I opened another door in the room and found a sort oflibrary. The door opposite mine I tried, but found it locked.In the library I found, to my great delight, a vast number of Englishbooks, whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines andnewspapers. A table in the centre was littered with English magazinesand newspapers, though none of them were of very recent date. The bookswere of the most varied kind--history, geography, politics, politicaleconomy, botany, geology, law--all relating to England and English lifeand customs and manners. There were even such books of reference as theLondon Directory, the “Red” and “Blue” books, Whitaker’s Almanac, theArmy and Navy Lists, and--it somehow gladdened my heart to see it--theLaw List.Whilst I was looking at the books, the door opened, and the Countentered. He saluted me in a hearty way, and hoped that I had had a goodnight’s rest. Then he went on:--“I am glad you found your way in here, for I am sure there is much thatwill interest you. These companions”--and he laid his hand on some ofthe books--“have been good friends to me, and for some years past, eversince I had the idea of going to London, have given me many, many hoursof pleasure. Through them I have come to know your great England; and toknow her is to love her. I long to go through the crowded streets ofyour mighty London, to be in the midst of the whirl and rush ofhumanity, to share its life, its change, its death, and all that makesit what it is. But alas! as yet I only know your tongue through books.To you, my friend, I look that I know it to speak.”“But, Count,” I said, “you know and speak English thoroughly!” He bowedgravely.“I thank you, my friend, for your all too-flattering estimate, but yet Ifear that I am but a little way on the road I would travel. True, I knowthe grammar and the words, but yet I know not how to speak them.”“Indeed,” I said, “you speak excellently.”“Not so,” he answered. “Well, I know that, did I move and speak in yourLondon, none there are who would not know me for a stranger. That is notenough for me. Here I am noble; I am _boyar_; the common people know me,and I am master. But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one; menknow him not--and to know not is to care not for. I am content if I amlike the rest, so that no man stops if he see me, or pause in hisspeaking if he hear my words, ‘Ha, ha! a stranger!’ I have been so longmaster that I would be master still--or at least that none other shouldbe master of me. You come to me not alone as agent of my friend PeterHawkins, of Exeter, to tell me all about my new estate in London. Youshall, I trust, rest here with me awhile, so that by our talking I maylearn the English intonation; and I would that you tell me when I makeerror, even of the smallest, in my speaking. I am sorry that I had to beaway so long to-day; but you will, I know, forgive one who has so manyimportant affairs in hand.”Of course I said all I could about being willing, and asked if I mightcome into that room when I chose. He answered: “Yes, certainly,” andadded:--“You may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors arelocked, where of course you will not wish to go. There is reason thatall things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know withmy knowledge, you would perhaps better understand.” I said I was sure ofthis, and then he went on:--“We are in Transylvania; and Transylvania is not England. Our ways arenot your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things. Nay, fromwhat you have told me of your experiences already, you know something ofwhat strange things there may be.”This led to much conversation; and as it was evident that he wanted totalk, if only for talking’s sake, I asked him many questions regardingthings that had already happened to me or come within my notice.Sometimes he sheered off the subject, or turned the conversation bypretending not to understand; but generally he answered all I asked mostfrankly. Then as time went on, and I had got somewhat bolder, I askedhim of some of the strange things of the preceding night, as, forinstance, why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blueflames. He then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on acertain night of the year--last night, in fact, when all evil spiritsare supposed to have unchecked sway--a blue flame is seen over any placewhere treasure has been concealed. “That treasure has been hidden,” hewent on, “in the region through which you came last night, there can bebut little doubt; for it was the ground fought over for centuries by theWallachian, the Saxon, and the Turk. Why, there is hardly a foot of soilin all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men,patriots or invaders. In old days there were stirring times, when theAustrian and the Hungarian came up in hordes, and the patriots went outto meet them--men and women, the aged and the children too--and waitedtheir coming on the rocks above the passes, that they might sweepdestruction on them with their artificial avalanches. When the invaderwas triumphant he found but little, for whatever there was had beensheltered in the friendly soil.”“But how,” said I, “can it have remained so long undiscovered, whenthere is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look?”The Count smiled, and as his lips ran back over his gums, the long,sharp, canine teeth showed out strangely; he answered:--“Because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool! Those flames onlyappear on one night; and on that night no man of this land will, if hecan help it, stir without his doors. And, dear sir, even if he did hewould not know what to do. Why, even the peasant that you tell me of whomarked the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylighteven for his own work. Even you would not, I dare be sworn, be able tofind these places again?”“There you are right,” I said. “I know no more than the dead where evento look for them.” Then we drifted into other matters.“Come,” he said at last, “tell me of London and of the house which youhave procured for me.” With an apology for my remissness, I went into myown room to get the papers from my bag. Whilst I was placing them inorder I heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room, and as Ipassed through, noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamplit, for it was by this time deep into the dark. The lamps were also litin the study or library, and I found the Count lying on the sofa,reading, of all things in the world, an English Bradshaw’s Guide. When Icame in he cleared the books and papers from the table; and with him Iwent into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts. He was interested ineverything, and asked me a myriad questions about the place and itssurroundings. He clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on thesubject of the neighbourhood, for he evidently at the end knew very muchmore than I did. When I remarked this, he answered:--“Well, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should? When I go thereI shall be all alone, and my friend Harker Jonathan--nay, pardon me, Ifall into my country’s habit of putting your patronymic first--my friendJonathan Harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me. He will bein Exeter, miles away, probably working at papers of the law with myother friend, Peter Hawkins. So!”We went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate atPurfleet. When I had told him the facts and got his signature to thenecessary papers, and had written a letter with them ready to post toMr. Hawkins, he began to ask me how I had come across so suitable aplace. I read to him the notes which I had made at the time, and which Iinscribe here:--“At Purfleet, on a by-road, I came across just such a place as seemed tobe required, and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the placewas for sale. It is surrounded by a high wall, of ancient structure,built of heavy stones, and has not been repaired for a large number ofyears. The closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron, all eaten withrust.“The estate is called Carfax, no doubt a corruption of the old _QuatreFace_, as the house is four-sided, agreeing with the cardinal points ofthe compass. It contains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded bythe solid stone wall above mentioned. There are many trees on it, whichmake it in places gloomy, and there is a deep, dark-looking pond orsmall lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear andflows away in a fair-sized stream. The house is very large and of allperiods back, I should say, to mediæval times, for one part is of stoneimmensely thick, with only a few windows high up and heavily barred withiron. It looks like part of a keep, and is close to an old chapel orchurch. I could not enter it, as I had not the key of the door leadingto it from the house, but I have taken with my kodak views of it fromvarious points. The house has been added to, but in a very stragglingway, and I can only guess at the amount of ground it covers, which mustbe very great. There are but few houses close at hand, one being a verylarge house only recently added to and formed into a private lunaticasylum. It is not, however, visible from the grounds.”When I had finished, he said:--“I am glad that it is old and big. I myself am of an old family, and tolive in a new house would kill me. A house cannot be made habitable in aday; and, after all, how few days go to make up a century. I rejoicealso that there is a chapel of old times. We Transylvanian nobles lovenot to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead. I seek notgaiety nor mirth, not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine andsparkling waters which please the young and gay. I am no longer young;and my heart, through weary years of mourning over the dead, is notattuned to mirth. Moreover, the walls of my castle are broken; theshadows are many, and the wind breathes cold through the brokenbattlements and casements. I love the shade and the shadow, and wouldbe alone with my thoughts when I may.” Somehow his words and his lookdid not seem to accord, or else it was that his cast of face made hissmile look malignant and saturnine.Presently, with an excuse, he left me, asking me to put all my paperstogether. He was some little time away, and I began to look at some ofthe books around me. One was an atlas, which I found opened naturally atEngland, as if that map had been much used. On looking at it I found incertain places little rings marked, and on examining these I noticedthat one was near London on the east side, manifestly where his newestate was situated; the other two were Exeter, and Whitby on theYorkshire coast.It was the better part of an hour when the Count returned. “Aha!” hesaid; “still at your books? Good! But you must not work always. Come; Iam informed that your supper is ready.” He took my arm, and we went intothe next room, where I found an excellent supper ready on the table. TheCount again excused himself, as he had dined out on his being away fromhome. But he sat as on the previous night, and chatted whilst I ate.After supper I smoked, as on the last evening, and the Count stayed withme, chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject, hourafter hour. I felt that it was getting very late indeed, but I did notsay anything, for I felt under obligation to meet my host’s wishes inevery way. I was not sleepy, as the long sleep yesterday had fortifiedme; but I could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one atthe coming of the dawn, which is like, in its way, the turn of the tide.They say that people who are near death die generally at the change tothe dawn or at the turn of the tide; any one who has when tired, andtied as it were to his post, experienced this change in the atmospherecan well believe it. All at once we heard the crow of a cock coming upwith preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air; CountDracula, jumping to his feet, said:--“Why, there is the morning again! How remiss I am to let you stay up solong. You must make your conversation regarding my dear new country ofEngland less interesting, so that I may not forget how time flies byus,” and, with a courtly bow, he quickly left me.I went into my own room and drew the curtains, but there was little tonotice; my window opened into the courtyard, all I could see was thewarm grey of quickening sky. So I pulled the curtains again, and havewritten of this day.*       *       *       *       *_8 May._--I began to fear as I wrote in this book that I was getting toodiffuse; but now I am glad that I went into detail from the first, forthere is something so strange about this place and all in it that Icannot but feel uneasy. I wish I were safe out of it, or that I hadnever come. It may be that this strange night-existence is telling onme; but would that that were all! If there were any one to talk to Icould bear it, but there is no one. I have only the Count to speak with,and he!--I fear I am myself the only living soul within the place. Letme be prosaic so far as facts can be; it will help me to bear up, andimagination must not run riot with me. If it does I am lost. Let me sayat once how I stand--or seem to.I only slept a few hours when I went to bed, and feeling that I couldnot sleep any more, got up. I had hung my shaving glass by the window,and was just beginning to shave. Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder,and heard the Count’s voice saying to me, “Good-morning.” I started, forit amazed me that I had not seen him, since the reflection of the glasscovered the whole room behind me. In starting I had cut myself slightly,but did not notice it at the moment. Having answered the Count’ssalutation, I turned to the glass again to see how I had been mistaken.This time there could be no error, for the man was close to me, and Icould see him over my shoulder. But there was no reflection of him inthe mirror! The whole room behind me was displayed; but there was nosign of a man in it, except myself. This was startling, and, coming onthe top of so many strange things, was beginning to increase that vaguefeeling of uneasiness which I always have when the Count is near; but atthe instant I saw that the cut had bled a little, and the blood wastrickling over my chin. I laid down the razor, turning as I did so halfround to look for some sticking plaster. When the Count saw my face, hiseyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury, and he suddenly made a grab atmy throat. I drew away, and his hand touched the string of beads whichheld the crucifix. It made an instant change in him, for the fury passedso quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there.“Take care,” he said, “take care how you cut yourself. It is moredangerous than you think in this country.” Then seizing the shavingglass, he went on: “And this is the wretched thing that has done themischief. It is a foul bauble of man’s vanity. Away with it!” andopening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand, he flungout the glass, which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stonesof the courtyard far below. Then he withdrew without a word. It is veryannoying, for I do not see how I am to shave, unless in my watch-case orthe bottom of the shaving-pot, which is fortunately of metal.When I went into the dining-room, breakfast was prepared; but I couldnot find the Count anywhere. So I breakfasted alone. It is strange thatas yet I have not seen the Count eat or drink. He must be a verypeculiar man! After breakfast I did a little exploring in the castle. Iwent out on the stairs, and found a room looking towards the South. Theview was magnificent, and from where I stood there was every opportunityof seeing it. The castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice. Astone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet withouttouching anything! As far as the eye can reach is a sea of green treetops, with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm. Here andthere are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges throughthe forests.But I am not in heart to describe beauty, for when I had seen the view Iexplored further; doors, doors, doors everywhere, and all locked andbolted. In no place save from the windows in the castle walls is therean available exit.The castle is a veritable prison, and I am a prisoner!CHAPTER IIIJONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL--_continued_When I found that I was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me.I rushed up and down the stairs, trying every door and peering out ofevery window I could find; but after a little the conviction of myhelplessness overpowered all other feelings. When I look back after afew hours I think I must have been mad for the time, for I behaved muchas a rat does in a trap. When, however, the conviction had come to methat I was helpless I sat down quietly--as quietly as I have ever doneanything in my life--and began to think over what was best to be done. Iam thinking still, and as yet have come to no definite conclusion. Ofone thing only am I certain; that it is no use making my ideas known tothe Count. He knows well that I am imprisoned; and as he has done ithimself, and has doubtless his own motives for it, he would only deceiveme if I trusted him fully with the facts. So far as I can see, my onlyplan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself, and my eyesopen. I am, I know, either being deceived, like a baby, by my own fears,or else I am in desperate straits; and if the latter be so, I need, andshall need, all my brains to get through.I had hardly come to this conclusion when I heard the great door belowshut, and knew that the Count had returned. He did not come at once intothe library, so I went cautiously to my own room and found him makingthe bed. This was odd, but only confirmed what I had all alongthought--that there were no servants in the house. When later I saw himthrough the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in thedining-room, I was assured of it; for if he does himself all thesemenial offices, surely it is proof that there is no one else to do them.This gave me a fright, for if there is no one else in the castle, itmust have been the Count himself who was the driver of the coach thatbrought me here. This is a terrible thought; for if so, what does itmean that he could control the wolves, as he did, by only holding up hishand in silence. How was it that all the people at Bistritz and on thecoach had some terrible fear for me? What meant the giving of thecrucifix, of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash? Blessthat good, good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck! for it is acomfort and a strength to me whenever I touch it. It is odd that a thingwhich I have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrousshould in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help. Is it that thereis something in the essence of the thing itself, or that it is a medium,a tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort? Sometime, if it may be, I must examine this matter and try to make up mymind about it. In the meantime I must find out all I can about CountDracula, as it may help me to understand. To-night he may talk ofhimself, if I turn the conversation that way. I must be very careful,however, not to awake his suspicion.*       *       *       *       *_Midnight._--I have had a long talk with the Count. I asked him a fewquestions on Transylvania history, and he warmed up to the subjectwonderfully. In his speaking of things and people, and especially ofbattles, he spoke as if he had been present at them all. This heafterwards explained by saying that to a _boyar_ the pride of his houseand name is his own pride, that their glory is his glory, that theirfate is his fate. Whenever he spoke of his house he always said “we,”and spoke almost in the plural, like a king speaking. I wish I could putdown all he said exactly as he said it, for to me it was mostfascinating. It seemed to have in it a whole history of the country. Hegrew excited as he spoke, and walked about the room pulling his greatwhite moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands asthough he would crush it by main strength. One thing he said which Ishall put down as nearly as I can; for it tells in its way the story ofhis race:--“We Szekelys have a right to be proud, for in our veins flows the bloodof many brave races who fought as the lion fights, for lordship. Here,in the whirlpool of European races, the Ugric tribe bore down fromIceland the fighting spirit which Thor and Wodin gave them, which theirBerserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of Europe, ay,and of Asia and Africa too, till the peoples thought that thewere-wolves themselves had come. Here, too, when they came, they foundthe Huns, whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame,till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of thoseold witches, who, expelled from Scythia had mated with the devils in thedesert. Fools, fools! What devil or what witch was ever so great asAttila, whose blood is in these veins?” He held up his arms. “Is it awonder that we were a conquering race; that we were proud; that when theMagyar, the Lombard, the Avar, the Bulgar, or the Turk poured histhousands on our frontiers, we drove them back? Is it strange that whenArpad and his legions swept through the Hungarian fatherland he found ushere when he reached the frontier; that the Honfoglalas was completedthere? And when the Hungarian flood swept eastward, the Szekelys wereclaimed as kindred by the victorious Magyars, and to us for centurieswas trusted the guarding of the frontier of Turkey-land; ay, and morethan that, endless duty of the frontier guard, for, as the Turks say,‘water sleeps, and enemy is sleepless.’ Who more gladly than wethroughout the Four Nations received the ‘bloody sword,’ or at itswarlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the King? When wasredeemed that great shame of my nation, the shame of Cassova, when theflags of the Wallach and the Magyar went down beneath the Crescent? Whowas it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beatthe Turk on his own ground? This was a Dracula indeed! Woe was it thathis own unworthy brother, when he had fallen, sold his people to theTurk and brought the shame of slavery on them! Was it not this Dracula,indeed, who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again andagain brought his forces over the great river into Turkey-land; who,when he was beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he hadto come alone from the bloody field where his troops were beingslaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph! Theysaid that he thought only of himself. Bah! what good are peasantswithout a leader? Where ends the war without a brain and heart toconduct it? Again, when, after the battle of Mohács, we threw off theHungarian yoke, we of the Dracula blood were amongst their leaders, forour spirit would not brook that we were not free. Ah, young sir, theSzekelys--and the Dracula as their heart’s blood, their brains, andtheir swords--can boast a record that mushroom growths like theHapsburgs and the Romanoffs can never reach. The warlike days are over.Blood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace; andthe glories of the great races are as a tale that is told.”It was by this time close on morning, and we went to bed. (_Mem._, thisdiary seems horribly like the beginning of the “Arabian Nights,” foreverything has to break off at cockcrow--or like the ghost of Hamlet’sfather.)*       *       *       *       *_12 May._--Let me begin with facts--bare, meagre facts, verified bybooks and figures, and of which there can be no doubt. I must notconfuse them with experiences which will have to rest on my ownobservation, or my memory of them. Last evening when the Count came fromhis room he began by asking me questions on legal matters and on thedoing of certain kinds of business. I had spent the day wearily overbooks, and, simply to keep my mind occupied, went over some of thematters I had been examining at Lincoln’s Inn. There was a certainmethod in the Count’s inquiries, so I shall try to put them down insequence; the knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to me.First, he asked if a man in England might have two solicitors or more. Itold him he might have a dozen if he wished, but that it would not bewise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction, as onlyone could act at a time, and that to change would be certain to militateagainst his interest. He seemed thoroughly to understand, and went on toask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one man toattend, say, to banking, and another to look after shipping, in caselocal help were needed in a place far from the home of the bankingsolicitor. I asked him to explain more fully, so that I might not by anychance mislead him, so he said:--“I shall illustrate. Your friend and mine, Mr. Peter Hawkins, from underthe shadow of your beautiful cathedral at Exeter, which is far fromLondon, buys for me through your good self my place at London. Good! Nowhere let me say frankly, lest you should think it strange that I havesought the services of one so far off from London instead of some oneresident there, that my motive was that no local interest might beserved save my wish only; and as one of London residence might, perhaps,have some purpose of himself or friend to serve, I went thus afield toseek my agent, whose labours should be only to my interest. Now, supposeI, who have much of affairs, wish to ship goods, say, to Newcastle, orDurham, or Harwich, or Dover, might it not be that it could with moreease be done by consigning to one in these ports?” I answered thatcertainly it would be most easy, but that we solicitors had a system ofagency one for the other, so that local work could be done locally oninstruction from any solicitor, so that the client, simply placinghimself in the hands of one man, could have his wishes carried out byhim without further trouble.“But,” said he, “I could be at liberty to direct myself. Is it not so?”“Of course,” I replied; and “such is often done by men of business, whodo not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person.”“Good!” he said, and then went on to ask about the means of makingconsignments and the forms to be gone through, and of all sorts ofdifficulties which might arise, but by forethought could be guardedagainst. I explained all these things to him to the best of my ability,and he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made awonderful solicitor, for there was nothing that he did not think of orforesee. For a man who was never in the country, and who did notevidently do much in the way of business, his knowledge and acumen werewonderful. When he had satisfied himself on these points of which he hadspoken, and I had verified all as well as I could by the booksavailable, he suddenly stood up and said:--“Have you written since your first letter to our friend Mr. PeterHawkins, or to any other?” It was with some bitterness in my heart thatI answered that I had not, that as yet I had not seen any opportunity ofsending letters to anybody.“Then write now, my young friend,” he said, laying a heavy hand on myshoulder: “write to our friend and to any other; and say, if it willplease you, that you shall stay with me until a month from now.”“Do you wish me to stay so long?” I asked, for my heart grew cold at thethought.“I desire it much; nay, I will take no refusal. When your master,employer, what you will, engaged that someone should come on his behalf,it was understood that my needs only were to be consulted. I have notstinted. Is it not so?”What could I do but bow acceptance? It was Mr. Hawkins’s interest, notmine, and I had to think of him, not myself; and besides, while CountDracula was speaking, there was that in his eyes and in his bearingwhich made me remember that I was a prisoner, and that if I wished it Icould have no choice. The Count saw his victory in my bow, and hismastery in the trouble of my face, for he began at once to use them, butin his own smooth, resistless way:--“I pray you, my good young friend, that you will not discourse of thingsother than business in your letters. It will doubtless please yourfriends to know that you are well, and that you look forward to gettinghome to them. Is it not so?” As he spoke he handed me three sheets ofnote-paper and three envelopes. They were all of the thinnest foreignpost, and looking at them, then at him, and noticing his quiet smile,with the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red underlip, I understoodas well as if he had spoken that I should be careful what I wrote, forhe would be able to read it. So I determined to write only formal notesnow, but to write fully to Mr. Hawkins in secret, and also to Mina, forto her I could write in shorthand, which would puzzle the Count, if hedid see it. When I had written my two letters I sat quiet, reading abook whilst the Count wrote several notes, referring as he wrote them tosome books on his table. Then he took up my two and placed them with hisown, and put by his writing materials, after which, the instant the doorhad closed behind him, I leaned over and looked at the letters, whichwere face down on the table. I felt no compunction in doing so, forunder the circumstances I felt that I should protect myself in every wayI could.One of the letters was directed to Samuel F. Billington, No. 7, TheCrescent, Whitby, another to Herr Leutner, Varna; the third was toCoutts & Co., London, and the fourth to Herren Klopstock & Billreuth,bankers, Buda-Pesth. The second and fourth were unsealed. I was justabout to look at them when I saw the door-handle move. I sank back in myseat, having just had time to replace the letters as they had been andto resume my book before the Count, holding still another letter in hishand, entered the room. He took up the letters on the table and stampedthem carefully, and then turning to me, said:--“I trust you will forgive me, but I have much work to do in private thisevening. You will, I hope, find all things as you wish.” At the door heturned, and after a moment’s pause said:--“Let me advise you, my dear young friend--nay, let me warn you with allseriousness, that should you leave these rooms you will not by anychance go to sleep in any other part of the castle. It is old, and hasmany memories, and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely. Bewarned! Should sleep now or ever overcome you, or be like to do, thenhaste to your own chamber or to these rooms, for your rest will then besafe. But if you be not careful in this respect, then”--He finished hisspeech in a gruesome way, for he motioned with his hands as if he werewashing them. I quite understood; my only doubt was as to whether anydream could be more terrible than the unnatural, horrible net of gloomand mystery which seemed closing around me.*       *       *       *       *_Later._--I endorse the last words written, but this time there is nodoubt in question. I shall not fear to sleep in any place where he isnot. I have placed the crucifix over the head of my bed--I imagine thatmy rest is thus freer from dreams; and there it shall remain.When he left me I went to my room. After a little while, not hearing anysound, I came out and went up the stone stair to where I could look outtowards the South. There was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse,inaccessible though it was to me, as compared with the narrow darknessof the courtyard. Looking out on this, I felt that I was indeed inprison, and I seemed to want a breath of fresh air, though it were ofthe night. I am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me.It is destroying my nerve. I start at my own shadow, and am full of allsorts of horrible imaginings. God knows that there is ground for myterrible fear in this accursed place! I looked out over the beautifulexpanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light asday. In the soft light the distant hills became melted, and the shadowsin the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness. The mere beauty seemedto cheer me; there was peace and comfort in every breath I drew. As Ileaned from the window my eye was caught by something moving a storeybelow me, and somewhat to my left, where I imagined, from the order ofthe rooms, that the windows of the Count’s own room would look out. Thewindow at which I stood was tall and deep, stone-mullioned, and thoughweatherworn, was still complete; but it was evidently many a day sincethe case had been there. I drew back behind the stonework, and lookedcarefully out.What I saw was the Count’s head coming out from the window. I did notsee the face, but I knew the man by the neck and the movement of hisback and arms. In any case I could not mistake the hands which I had hadso many opportunities of studying. I was at first interested andsomewhat amused, for it is wonderful how small a matter will interestand amuse a man when he is a prisoner. But my very feelings changed torepulsion and terror when I saw the whole man slowly emerge from thewindow and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss,_face down_ with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings. Atfirst I could not believe my eyes. I thought it was some trick of themoonlight, some weird effect of shadow; but I kept looking, and it couldbe no delusion. I saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of thestones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years, and by thususing every projection and inequality move downwards with considerablespeed, just as a lizard moves along a wall.What manner of man is this, or what manner of creature is it in thesemblance of man? I feel the dread of this horrible place overpoweringme; I am in fear--in awful fear--and there is no escape for me; I amencompassed about with terrors that I dare not think of....*       *       *       *       *_15 May._--Once more have I seen the Count go out in his lizard fashion.He moved downwards in a sidelong way, some hundred feet down, and a gooddeal to the left. He vanished into some hole or window. When his headhad disappeared, I leaned out to try and see more, but withoutavail--the distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight. Iknew he had left the castle now, and thought to use the opportunity toexplore more than I had dared to do as yet. I went back to the room, andtaking a lamp, tried all the doors. They were all locked, as I hadexpected, and the locks were comparatively new; but I went down thestone stairs to the hall where I had entered originally. I found I couldpull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains; but thedoor was locked, and the key was gone! That key must be in the Count’sroom; I must watch should his door be unlocked, so that I may get it andescape. I went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairsand passages, and to try the doors that opened from them. One or twosmall rooms near the hall were open, but there was nothing to see inthem except old furniture, dusty with age and moth-eaten. At last,however, I found one door at the top of the stairway which, though itseemed to be locked, gave a little under pressure. I tried it harder,and found that it was not really locked, but that the resistance camefrom the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat, and the heavy doorrested on the floor. Here was an opportunity which I might not haveagain, so I exerted myself, and with many efforts forced it back so thatI could enter. I was now in a wing of the castle further to the rightthan the rooms I knew and a storey lower down. From the windows I couldsee that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle, thewindows of the end room looking out both west and south. On the latterside, as well as to the former, there was a great precipice. The castlewas built on the corner of a great rock, so that on three sides it wasquite impregnable, and great windows were placed here where sling, orbow, or culverin could not reach, and consequently light and comfort,impossible to a position which had to be guarded, were secured. To thewest was a great valley, and then, rising far away, great jaggedmountain fastnesses, rising peak on peak, the sheer rock studded withmountain ash and thorn, whose roots clung in cracks and crevices andcrannies of the stone. This was evidently the portion of the castleoccupied by the ladies in bygone days, for the furniture had more air ofcomfort than any I had seen. The windows were curtainless, and theyellow moonlight, flooding in through the diamond panes, enabled one tosee even colours, whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay overall and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth. Mylamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight, but I wasglad to have it with me, for there was a dread loneliness in the placewhich chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble. Still, it was betterthan living alone in the rooms which I had come to hate from thepresence of the Count, and after trying a little to school my nerves, Ifound a soft quietude come over me. Here I am, sitting at a little oaktable where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with muchthought and many blushes, her ill-spelt love-letter, and writing in mydiary in shorthand all that has happened since I closed it last. It isnineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance. And yet, unless mysenses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of their ownwhich mere “modernity” cannot kill.*       *       *       *       *_Later: the Morning of 16 May._--God preserve my sanity, for to this Iam reduced. Safety and the assurance of safety are things of the past.Whilst I live on here there is but one thing to hope for, that I may notgo mad, if, indeed, I be not mad already. If I be sane, then surely itis maddening to think that of all the foul things that lurk in thishateful place the Count is the least dreadful to me; that to him alone Ican look for safety, even though this be only whilst I can serve hispurpose. Great God! merciful God! Let me be calm, for out of that waylies madness indeed. I begin to get new lights on certain things whichhave puzzled me. Up to now I never quite knew what Shakespeare meantwhen he made Hamlet say:--“My tablets! quick, my tablets!’Tis meet that I put it down,” etc.,for now, feeling as though my own brain were unhinged or as if the shockhad come which must end in its undoing, I turn to my diary for repose.The habit of entering accurately must help to soothe me.The Count’s mysterious warning frightened me at the time; it frightensme more now when I think of it, for in future he has a fearful hold uponme. I shall fear to doubt what he may say!When I had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book andpen in my pocket I felt sleepy. The Count’s warning came into my mind,but I took a pleasure in disobeying it. The sense of sleep was upon me,and with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider. The softmoonlight soothed, and the wide expanse without gave a sense of freedomwhich refreshed me. I determined not to return to-night to thegloom-haunted rooms, but to sleep here, where, of old, ladies had satand sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad fortheir menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars. I drew a greatcouch out of its place near the corner, so that as I lay, I could lookat the lovely view to east and south, and unthinking of and uncaring forthe dust, composed myself for sleep. I suppose I must have fallenasleep; I hope so, but I fear, for all that followed was startlinglyreal--so real that now sitting here in the broad, full sunlight of themorning, I cannot in the least believe that it was all sleep.I was not alone. The room was the same, unchanged in any way since Icame into it; I could see along the floor, in the brilliant moonlight,my own footsteps marked where I had disturbed the long accumulation ofdust. In the moonlight opposite me were three young women, ladies bytheir dress and manner. I thought at the time that I must be dreamingwhen I saw them, for, though the moonlight was behind them, they threwno shadow on the floor. They came close to me, and looked at me for sometime, and then whispered together. Two were dark, and had high aquilinenoses, like the Count, and great dark, piercing eyes that seemed to bealmost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon. The other wasfair, as fair as can be, with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyeslike pale sapphires. I seemed somehow to know her face, and to know itin connection with some dreamy fear, but I could not recollect at themoment how or where. All three had brilliant white teeth that shone likepearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips. There was somethingabout them that made me uneasy, some longing and at the same time somedeadly fear. I felt in my heart a wicked, burning desire that they wouldkiss me with those red lips. It is not good to note this down, lest someday it should meet Mina’s eyes and cause her pain; but it is the truth.They whispered together, and then they all three laughed--such asilvery, musical laugh, but as hard as though the sound never could havecome through the softness of human lips. It was like the intolerable,tingling sweetness of water-glasses when played on by a cunning hand.The fair girl shook her head coquettishly, and the other two urged heron. One said:--“Go on! You are first, and we shall follow; yours is the right tobegin.” The other added:--“He is young and strong; there are kisses for us all.” I lay quiet,looking out under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation.The fair girl advanced and bent over me till I could feel the movementof her breath upon me. Sweet it was in one sense, honey-sweet, and sentthe same tingling through the nerves as her voice, but with a bitterunderlying the sweet, a bitter offensiveness, as one smells in blood.I was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly underthe lashes. The girl went on her knees, and bent over me, simplygloating. There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrillingand repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lipslike an animal, till I could see in the moonlight the moisture shiningon the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharpteeth. Lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range ofmy mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my throat. Then shepaused, and I could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it lickedher teeth and lips, and could feel the hot breath on my neck. Then theskin of my throat began to tingle as one’s flesh does when the hand thatis to tickle it approaches nearer--nearer. I could feel the soft,shivering touch of the lips on the super-sensitive skin of my throat,and the hard dents of two sharp teeth, just touching and pausing there.I closed my eyes in a languorous ecstasy and waited--waited with beatingheart.But at that instant, another sensation swept through me as quick aslightning. I was conscious of the presence of the Count, and of hisbeing as if lapped in a storm of fury. As my eyes opened involuntarily Isaw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and withgiant’s power draw it back, the blue eyes transformed with fury, thewhite teeth champing with rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red withpassion. But the Count! Never did I imagine such wrath and fury, even tothe demons of the pit. His eyes were positively blazing. The red lightin them was lurid, as if the flames of hell-fire blazed behind them. Hisface was deathly pale, and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires;the thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving barof white-hot metal. With a fierce sweep of his arm, he hurled the womanfrom him, and then motioned to the others, as though he were beatingthem back; it was the same imperious gesture that I had seen used to thewolves. In a voice which, though low and almost in a whisper seemed tocut through the air and then ring round the room he said:--“How dare you touch him, any of you? How dare you cast eyes on him whenI had forbidden it? Back, I tell you all! This man belongs to me! Bewarehow you meddle with him, or you’ll have to deal with me.” The fair girl,with a laugh of ribald coquetry, turned to answer him:--“You yourself never loved; you never love!” On this the other womenjoined, and such a mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang through theroom that it almost made me faint to hear; it seemed like the pleasureof fiends. Then the Count turned, after looking at my face attentively,and said in a soft whisper:--“Yes, I too can love; you yourselves can tell it from the past. Is itnot so? Well, now I promise you that when I am done with him you shallkiss him at your will. Now go! go! I must awaken him, for there is workto be done.”“Are we to have nothing to-night?” said one of them, with a low laugh,as she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor, and whichmoved as though there were some living thing within it. For answer henodded his head. One of the women jumped forward and opened it. If myears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail, as of ahalf-smothered child. The women closed round, whilst I was aghast withhorror; but as I looked they disappeared, and with them the dreadfulbag. There was no door near them, and they could not have passed mewithout my noticing. They simply seemed to fade into the rays of themoonlight and pass out through the window, for I could see outside thedim, shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely faded away.Then the horror overcame me, and I sank down unconscious.CHAPTER IVJONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL--_continued_I awoke in my own bed. If it be that I had not dreamt, the Count musthave carried me here. I tried to satisfy myself on the subject, butcould not arrive at any unquestionable result. To be sure, there werecertain small evidences, such as that my clothes were folded and laid byin a manner which was not my habit. My watch was still unwound, and I amrigorously accustomed to wind it the last thing before going to bed, andmany such details. But these things are no proof, for they may have beenevidences that my mind was not as usual, and, from some cause oranother, I had certainly been much upset. I must watch for proof. Of onething I am glad: if it was that the Count carried me here and undressedme, he must have been hurried in his task, for my pockets are intact. Iam sure this diary would have been a mystery to him which he would nothave brooked. He would have taken or destroyed it. As I look round thisroom, although it has been to me so full of fear, it is now a sort ofsanctuary, for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful women, whowere--who _are_--waiting to suck my blood.*       *       *       *       *_18 May._--I have been down to look at that room again in daylight, forI _must_ know the truth. When I got to the doorway at the top of thestairs I found it closed. It had been so forcibly driven against thejamb that part of the woodwork was splintered. I could see that the boltof the lock had not been shot, but the door is fastened from the inside.I fear it was no dream, and must act on this surmise.*       *       *       *       *_19 May._--I am surely in the toils. Last night the Count asked me inthe suavest tones to write three letters, one saying that my work herewas nearly done, and that I should start for home within a few days,another that I was starting on the next morning from the time of theletter, and the third that I had left the castle and arrived atBistritz. I would fain have rebelled, but felt that in the present stateof things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the Count whilst Iam so absolutely in his power; and to refuse would be to excite hissuspicion and to arouse his anger. He knows that I know too much, andthat I must not live, lest I be dangerous to him; my only chance is toprolong my opportunities. Something may occur which will give me achance to escape. I saw in his eyes something of that gathering wrathwhich was manifest when he hurled that fair woman from him. He explainedto me that posts were few and uncertain, and that my writing now wouldensure ease of mind to my friends; and he assured me with so muchimpressiveness that he would countermand the later letters, which wouldbe held over at Bistritz until due time in case chance would admit of myprolonging my stay, that to oppose him would have been to create newsuspicion. I therefore pretended to fall in with his views, and askedhim what dates I should put on the letters. He calculated a minute, andthen said:--“The first should be June 12, the second June 19, and the third June29.”I know now the span of my life. God help me!*       *       *       *       *_28 May._--There is a chance of escape, or at any rate of being able tosend word home. A band of Szgany have come to the castle, and areencamped in the courtyard. These Szgany are gipsies; I have notes ofthem in my book. They are peculiar to this part of the world, thoughallied to the ordinary gipsies all the world over. There are thousandsof them in Hungary and Transylvania, who are almost outside all law.They attach themselves as a rule to some great noble or _boyar_, andcall themselves by his name. They are fearless and without religion,save superstition, and they talk only their own varieties of the Romanytongue.I shall write some letters home, and shall try to get them to have themposted. I have already spoken them through my window to beginacquaintanceship. They took their hats off and made obeisance and manysigns, which, however, I could not understand any more than I couldtheir spoken language....*       *       *       *       *I have written the letters. Mina’s is in shorthand, and I simply ask Mr.Hawkins to communicate with her. To her I have explained my situation,but without the horrors which I may only surmise. It would shock andfrighten her to death were I to expose my heart to her. Should theletters not carry, then the Count shall not yet know my secret or theextent of my knowledge....*       *       *       *       *I have given the letters; I threw them through the bars of my windowwith a gold piece, and made what signs I could to have them posted. Theman who took them pressed them to his heart and bowed, and then put themin his cap. I could do no more. I stole back to the study, and began toread. As the Count did not come in, I have written here....*       *       *       *       *The Count has come. He sat down beside me, and said in his smoothestvoice as he opened two letters:--“The Szgany has given me these, of which, though I know not whence theycome, I shall, of course, take care. See!”--he must have looked atit--“one is from you, and to my friend Peter Hawkins; the other”--herehe caught sight of the strange symbols as he opened the envelope, andthe dark look came into his face, and his eyes blazed wickedly--“theother is a vile thing, an outrage upon friendship and hospitality! It isnot signed. Well! so it cannot matter to us.” And he calmly held letterand envelope in the flame of the lamp till they were consumed. Then hewent on:--“The letter to Hawkins--that I shall, of course, send on, since it isyours. Your letters are sacred to me. Your pardon, my friend, thatunknowingly I did break the seal. Will you not cover it again?” He heldout the letter to me, and with a courteous bow handed me a cleanenvelope. I could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence. Whenhe went out of the room I could hear the key turn softly. A minute laterI went over and tried it, and the door was locked.When, an hour or two after, the Count came quietly into the room, hiscoming awakened me, for I had gone to sleep on the sofa. He was verycourteous and very cheery in his manner, and seeing that I had beensleeping, he said:--“So, my friend, you are tired? Get to bed. There is the surest rest. Imay not have the pleasure to talk to-night, since there are many laboursto me; but you will sleep, I pray.” I passed to my room and went to bed,and, strange to say, slept without dreaming. Despair has its own calms.*       *       *       *       *_31 May._--This morning when I woke I thought I would provide myselfwith some paper and envelopes from my bag and keep them in my pocket, sothat I might write in case I should get an opportunity, but again asurprise, again a shock!Every scrap of paper was gone, and with it all my notes, my memoranda,relating to railways and travel, my letter of credit, in fact all thatmight be useful to me were I once outside the castle. I sat and ponderedawhile, and then some thought occurred to me, and I made search of myportmanteau and in the wardrobe where I had placed my clothes.The suit in which I had travelled was gone, and also my overcoat andrug; I could find no trace of them anywhere. This looked like some newscheme of villainy....*       *       *       *       *_17 June._--This morning, as I was sitting on the edge of my bedcudgelling my brains, I heard without a cracking of whips and poundingand scraping of horses’ feet up the rocky path beyond the courtyard.With joy I hurried to the window, and saw drive into the yard two greatleiter-wagons, each drawn by eight sturdy horses, and at the head ofeach pair a Slovak, with his wide hat, great nail-studded belt, dirtysheepskin, and high boots. They had also their long staves in hand. Iran to the door, intending to descend and try and join them through themain hall, as I thought that way might be opened for them. Again ashock: my door was fastened on the outside.Then I ran to the window and cried to them. They looked up at mestupidly and pointed, but just then the “hetman” of the Szgany came out,and seeing them pointing to my window, said something, at which theylaughed. Henceforth no effort of mine, no piteous cry or agonisedentreaty, would make them even look at me. They resolutely turned away.The leiter-wagons contained great, square boxes, with handles of thickrope; these were evidently empty by the ease with which the Slovakshandled them, and by their resonance as they were roughly moved. Whenthey were all unloaded and packed in a great heap in one corner of theyard, the Slovaks were given some money by the Szgany, and spitting onit for luck, lazily went each to his horse’s head. Shortly afterwards, Iheard the cracking of their whips die away in the distance.*       *       *       *       *_24 June, before morning._--Last night the Count left me early, andlocked himself into his own room. As soon as I dared I ran up thewinding stair, and looked out of the window, which opened south. Ithought I would watch for the Count, for there is something going on.The Szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing work ofsome kind. I know it, for now and then I hear a far-away muffled soundas of mattock and spade, and, whatever it is, it must be the end of someruthless villainy.I had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour, when I sawsomething coming out of the Count’s window. I drew back and watchedcarefully, and saw the whole man emerge. It was a new shock to me tofind that he had on the suit of clothes which I had worn whilsttravelling here, and slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which Ihad seen the women take away. There could be no doubt as to his quest,and in my garb, too! This, then, is his new scheme of evil: that he willallow others to see me, as they think, so that he may both leaveevidence that I have been seen in the towns or villages posting my ownletters, and that any wickedness which he may do shall by the localpeople be attributed to me.It makes me rage to think that this can go on, and whilst I am shut uphere, a veritable prisoner, but without that protection of the law whichis even a criminal’s right and consolation.I thought I would watch for the Count’s return, and for a long time satdoggedly at the window. Then I began to notice that there were somequaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight. They werelike the tiniest grains of dust, and they whirled round and gathered inclusters in a nebulous sort of way. I watched them with a sense ofsoothing, and a sort of calm stole over me. I leaned back in theembrasure in a more comfortable position, so that I could enjoy morefully the aërial gambolling.Something made me start up, a low, piteous howling of dogs somewhere farbelow in the valley, which was hidden from my sight. Louder it seemed toring in my ears, and the floating motes of dust to take new shapes tothe sound as they danced in the moonlight. I felt myself struggling toawake to some call of my instincts; nay, my very soul was struggling,and my half-remembered sensibilities were striving to answer the call. Iwas becoming hypnotised! Quicker and quicker danced the dust; themoonbeams seemed to quiver as they went by me into the mass of gloombeyond. More and more they gathered till they seemed to take dim phantomshapes. And then I started, broad awake and in full possession of mysenses, and ran screaming from the place. The phantom shapes, which werebecoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams, were those of thethree ghostly women to whom I was doomed. I fled, and felt somewhatsafer in my own room, where there was no moonlight and where the lampwas burning brightly.When a couple of hours had passed I heard something stirring in theCount’s room, something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed; and thenthere was silence, deep, awful silence, which chilled me. With abeating heart, I tried the door; but I was locked in my prison, andcould do nothing. I sat down and simply cried.As I sat I heard a sound in the courtyard without--the agonised cry of awoman. I rushed to the window, and throwing it up, peered out betweenthe bars. There, indeed, was a woman with dishevelled hair, holding herhands over her heart as one distressed with running. She was leaningagainst a corner of the gateway. When she saw my face at the window shethrew herself forward, and shouted in a voice laden with menace:--“Monster, give me my child!”She threw herself on her knees, and raising up her hands, cried the samewords in tones which wrung my heart. Then she tore her hair and beat herbreast, and abandoned herself to all the violences of extravagantemotion. Finally, she threw herself forward, and, though I could not seeher, I could hear the beating of her naked hands against the door.Somewhere high overhead, probably on the tower, I heard the voice of theCount calling in his harsh, metallic whisper. His call seemed to beanswered from far and wide by the howling of wolves. Before many minuteshad passed a pack of them poured, like a pent-up dam when liberated,through the wide entrance into the courtyard.There was no cry from the woman, and the howling of the wolves was butshort. Before long they streamed away singly, licking their lips.I could not pity her, for I knew now what had become of her child, andshe was better dead.What shall I do? what can I do? How can I escape from this dreadfulthing of night and gloom and fear?*       *       *       *       *_25 June, morning._--No man knows till he has suffered from the nighthow sweet and how dear to his heart and eye the morning can be. When thesun grew so high this morning that it struck the top of the greatgateway opposite my window, the high spot which it touched seemed to meas if the dove from the ark had lighted there. My fear fell from me asif it had been a vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth. I musttake action of some sort whilst the courage of the day is upon me. Lastnight one of my post-dated letters went to post, the first of that fatalseries which is to blot out the very traces of my existence from theearth.Let me not think of it. Action!It has always been at night-time that I have been molested orthreatened, or in some way in danger or in fear. I have not yet seen theCount in the daylight. Can it be that he sleeps when others wake, thathe may be awake whilst they sleep? If I could only get into his room!But there is no possible way. The door is always locked, no way for me.Yes, there is a way, if one dares to take it. Where his body has gonewhy may not another body go? I have seen him myself crawl from hiswindow. Why should not I imitate him, and go in by his window? Thechances are desperate, but my need is more desperate still. I shall riskit. At the worst it can only be death; and a man’s death is not acalf’s, and the dreaded Hereafter may still be open to me. God help mein my task! Good-bye, Mina, if I fail; good-bye, my faithful friend andsecond father; good-bye, all, and last of all Mina!*       *       *       *       *_Same day, later._--I have made the effort, and God, helping me, havecome safely back to this room. I must put down every detail in order. Iwent whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the southside, and at once got outside on the narrow ledge of stone which runsaround the building on this side. The stones are big and roughly cut,and the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them. Itook off my boots, and ventured out on the desperate way. I looked downonce, so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful depth wouldnot overcome me, but after that kept my eyes away from it. I knew prettywell the direction and distance of the Count’s window, and made for itas well as I could, having regard to the opportunities available. I didnot feel dizzy--I suppose I was too excited--and the time seemedridiculously short till I found myself standing on the window-sill andtrying to raise up the sash. I was filled with agitation, however, whenI bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window. Then I lookedaround for the Count, but, with surprise and gladness, made a discovery.The room was empty! It was barely furnished with odd things, whichseemed to have never been used; the furniture was something the samestyle as that in the south rooms, and was covered with dust. I lookedfor the key, but it was not in the lock, and I could not find itanywhere. The only thing I found was a great heap of gold in onecorner--gold of all kinds, Roman, and British, and Austrian, andHungarian, and Greek and Turkish money, covered with a film of dust, asthough it had lain long in the ground. None of it that I noticed wasless than three hundred years old. There were also chains and ornaments,some jewelled, but all of them old and stained.At one corner of the room was a heavy door. I tried it, for, since Icould not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door, whichwas the main object of my search, I must make further examination, orall my efforts would be in vain. It was open, and led through a stonepassage to a circular stairway, which went steeply down. I descended,minding carefully where I went, for the stairs were dark, being only litby loopholes in the heavy masonry. At the bottom there was a dark,tunnel-like passage, through which came a deathly, sickly odour, theodour of old earth newly turned. As I went through the passage the smellgrew closer and heavier. At last I pulled open a heavy door which stoodajar, and found myself in an old, ruined chapel, which had evidentlybeen used as a graveyard. The roof was broken, and in two places weresteps leading to vaults, but the ground had recently been dug over, andthe earth placed in great wooden boxes, manifestly those which had beenbrought by the Slovaks. There was nobody about, and I made search forany further outlet, but there was none. Then I went over every inch ofthe ground, so as not to lose a chance. I went down even into thevaults, where the dim light struggled, although to do so was a dread tomy very soul. Into two of these I went, but saw nothing except fragmentsof old coffins and piles of dust; in the third, however, I made adiscovery.There, in one of the great boxes, of which there were fifty in all, on apile of newly dug earth, lay the Count! He was either dead or asleep, Icould not say which--for the eyes were open and stony, but without theglassiness of death--and the cheeks had the warmth of life through alltheir pallor; the lips were as red as ever. But there was no sign ofmovement, no pulse, no breath, no beating of the heart. I bent over him,and tried to find any sign of life, but in vain. He could not have lainthere long, for the earthy smell would have passed away in a few hours.By the side of the box was its cover, pierced with holes here and there.I thought he might have the keys on him, but when I went to search I sawthe dead eyes, and in them, dead though they were, such a look of hate,though unconscious of me or my presence, that I fled from the place, andleaving the Count’s room by the window, crawled again up the castlewall. Regaining my room, I threw myself panting upon the bed and triedto think....*       *       *       *       *_29 June._--To-day is the date of my last letter, and the Count hastaken steps to prove that it was genuine, for again I saw him leave thecastle by the same window, and in my clothes. As he went down the wall,lizard fashion, I wished I had a gun or some lethal weapon, that I mightdestroy him; but I fear that no weapon wrought alone by man’s hand wouldhave any effect on him. I dared not wait to see him return, for I fearedto see those weird sisters. I came back to the library, and read theretill I fell asleep.I was awakened by the Count, who looked at me as grimly as a man canlook as he said:--“To-morrow, my friend, we must part. You return to your beautifulEngland, I to some work which may have such an end that we may nevermeet. Your letter home has been despatched; to-morrow I shall not behere, but all shall be ready for your journey. In the morning come theSzgany, who have some labours of their own here, and also come someSlovaks. When they have gone, my carriage shall come for you, and shallbear you to the Borgo Pass to meet the diligence from Bukovina toBistritz. But I am in hopes that I shall see more of you at CastleDracula.” I suspected him, and determined to test his sincerity.Sincerity! It seems like a profanation of the word to write it inconnection with such a monster, so asked him point-blank:--“Why may I not go to-night?”“Because, dear sir, my coachman and horses are away on a mission.”“But I would walk with pleasure. I want to get away at once.” He smiled,such a soft, smooth, diabolical smile that I knew there was some trickbehind his smoothness. He said:--“And your baggage?”“I do not care about it. I can send for it some other time.”The Count stood up, and said, with a sweet courtesy which made me rub myeyes, it seemed so real:--“You English have a saying which is close to my heart, for its spirit isthat which rules our _boyars_: ‘Welcome the coming; speed the partingguest.’ Come with me, my dear young friend. Not an hour shall you waitin my house against your will, though sad am I at your going, and thatyou so suddenly desire it. Come!” With a stately gravity, he, with thelamp, preceded me down the stairs and along the hall. Suddenly hestopped.“Hark!”Close at hand came the howling of many wolves. It was almost as if thesound sprang up at the rising of his hand, just as the music of a greatorchestra seems to leap under the bâton of the conductor. After a pauseof a moment, he proceeded, in his stately way, to the door, drew backthe ponderous bolts, unhooked the heavy chains, and began to draw itopen.To my intense astonishment I saw that it was unlocked. Suspiciously, Ilooked all round, but could see no key of any kind.As the door began to open, the howling of the wolves without grew louderand angrier; their red jaws, with champing teeth, and their blunt-clawedfeet as they leaped, came in through the opening door. I knew then thatto struggle at the moment against the Count was useless. With suchallies as these at his command, I could do nothing. But still the doorcontinued slowly to open, and only the Count’s body stood in the gap.Suddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and means of mydoom; I was to be given to the wolves, and at my own instigation. Therewas a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the Count, andas a last chance I cried out:--“Shut the door; I shall wait till morning!” and covered my face with myhands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment. With one sweep of hispowerful arm, the Count threw the door shut, and the great bolts clangedand echoed through the hall as they shot back into their places.In silence we returned to the library, and after a minute or two I wentto my own room. The last I saw of Count Dracula was his kissing his handto me; with a red light of triumph in his eyes, and with a smile thatJudas in hell might be proud of.When I was in my room and about to lie down, I thought I heard awhispering at my door. I went to it softly and listened. Unless my earsdeceived me, I heard the voice of the Count:--“Back, back, to your own place! Your time is not yet come. Wait! Havepatience! To-night is mine. To-morrow night is yours!” There was a low,sweet ripple of laughter, and in a rage I threw open the door, and sawwithout the three terrible women licking their lips. As I appeared theyall joined in a horrible laugh, and ran away.I came back to my room and threw myself on my knees. It is then so nearthe end? To-morrow! to-morrow! Lord, help me, and those to whom I amdear!*       *       *       *       *_30 June, morning._--These may be the last words I ever write in thisdiary. I slept till just before the dawn, and when I woke threw myselfon my knees, for I determined that if Death came he should find meready.At last I felt that subtle change in the air, and knew that the morninghad come. Then came the welcome cock-crow, and I felt that I was safe.With a glad heart, I opened my door and ran down to the hall. I had seenthat the door was unlocked, and now escape was before me. With handsthat trembled with eagerness, I unhooked the chains and drew back themassive bolts.But the door would not move. Despair seized me. I pulled, and pulled, atthe door, and shook it till, massive as it was, it rattled in itscasement. I could see the bolt shot. It had been locked after I left theCount.Then a wild desire took me to obtain that key at any risk, and Idetermined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the Count’sroom. He might kill me, but death now seemed the happier choice ofevils. Without a pause I rushed up to the east window, and scrambleddown the wall, as before, into the Count’s room. It was empty, but thatwas as I expected. I could not see a key anywhere, but the heap of goldremained. I went through the door in the corner and down the windingstair and along the dark passage to the old chapel. I knew now wellenough where to find the monster I sought.The great box was in the same place, close against the wall, but the lidwas laid on it, not fastened down, but with the nails ready in theirplaces to be hammered home. I knew I must reach the body for the key, soI raised the lid, and laid it back against the wall; and then I sawsomething which filled my very soul with horror. There lay the Count,but looking as if his youth had been half renewed, for the white hairand moustache were changed to dark iron-grey; the cheeks were fuller,and the white skin seemed ruby-red underneath; the mouth was redder thanever, for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood, which trickled from thecorners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck. Even the deep,burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh, for the lids and pouchesunderneath were bloated. It seemed as if the whole awful creature weresimply gorged with blood. He lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with hisrepletion. I shuddered as I bent over to touch him, and every sense inme revolted at the contact; but I had to search, or I was lost. Thecoming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar way to thosehorrid three. I felt all over the body, but no sign could I find of thekey. Then I stopped and looked at the Count. There was a mocking smileon the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad. This was the being Iwas helping to transfer to London, where, perhaps, for centuries to comehe might, amongst its teeming millions, satiate his lust for blood, andcreate a new and ever-widening circle of semi-demons to batten on thehelpless. The very thought drove me mad. A terrible desire came upon meto rid the world of such a monster. There was no lethal weapon at hand,but I seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill thecases, and lifting it high, struck, with the edge downward, at thehateful face. But as I did so the head turned, and the eyes fell fullupon me, with all their blaze of basilisk horror. The sight seemed toparalyse me, and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face,merely making a deep gash above the forehead. The shovel fell from myhand across the box, and as I pulled it away the flange of the bladecaught the edge of the lid which fell over again, and hid the horridthing from my sight. The last glimpse I had was of the bloated face,blood-stained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held itsown in the nethermost hell.I thought and thought what should be my next move, but my brain seemedon fire, and I waited with a despairing feeling growing over me. As Iwaited I heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices comingcloser, and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and thecracking of whips; the Szgany and the Slovaks of whom the Count hadspoken were coming. With a last look around and at the box whichcontained the vile body, I ran from the place and gained the Count’sroom, determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened.With strained ears, I listened, and heard downstairs the grinding of thekey in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door. There musthave been some other means of entry, or some one had a key for one ofthe locked doors. Then there came the sound of many feet tramping anddying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo. I turned torun down again towards the vault, where I might find the new entrance;but at the moment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind, and thedoor to the winding stair blew to with a shock that set the dust fromthe lintels flying. When I ran to push it open, I found that it washopelessly fast. I was again a prisoner, and the net of doom was closinground me more closely.As I write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feetand the crash of weights being set down heavily, doubtless the boxes,with their freight of earth. There is a sound of hammering; it is thebox being nailed down. Now I can hear the heavy feet tramping againalong the hall, with many other idle feet coming behind them.The door is shut, and the chains rattle; there is a grinding of the keyin the lock; I can hear the key withdraw: then another door opens andshuts; I hear the creaking of lock and bolt.Hark! in the courtyard and down the rocky way the roll of heavy wheels,the crack of whips, and the chorus of the Szgany as they pass into thedistance.I am alone in the castle with those awful women. Faugh! Mina is a woman,and there is nought in common. They are devils of the Pit!I shall not remain alone with them; I shall try to scale the castle wallfarther than I have yet attempted. I shall take some of the gold withme, lest I want it later. I may find a way from this dreadful place.And then away for home! away to the quickest and nearest train! awayfrom this cursed spot, from this cursed land, where the devil and hischildren still walk with earthly feet!At least God’s mercy is better than that of these monsters, and theprecipice is steep and high. At its foot a man may sleep--as a man.Good-bye, all! Mina!CHAPTER V_Letter from Miss Mina Murray to Miss Lucy Westenra._“_9 May._“My dearest Lucy,--“Forgive my long delay in writing, but I have been simply overwhelmedwith work. The life of an assistant schoolmistress is sometimes trying.I am longing to be with you, and by the sea, where we can talk togetherfreely and build our castles in the air. I have been working very hardlately, because I want to keep up with Jonathan’s studies, and I havebeen practising shorthand very assiduously. When we are married I shallbe able to be useful to Jonathan, and if I can stenograph well enough Ican take down what he wants to say in this way and write it out forhim on the typewriter, at which also I am practising very hard. Heand I sometimes write letters in shorthand, and he is keeping astenographic journal of his travels abroad. When I am with you Ishall keep a diary in the same way. I don’t mean one of thosetwo-pages-to-the-week-with-Sunday-squeezed-in-a-corner diaries, but asort of journal which I can write in whenever I feel inclined. I do notsuppose there will be much of interest to other people; but it is notintended for them. I may show it to Jonathan some day if there is in itanything worth sharing, but it is really an exercise book. I shall tryto do what I see lady journalists do: interviewing and writingdescriptions and trying to remember conversations. I am told that, witha little practice, one can remember all that goes on or that one hearssaid during a day. However, we shall see. I will tell you of my littleplans when we meet. I have just had a few hurried lines from Jonathanfrom Transylvania. He is well, and will be returning in about a week. Iam longing to hear all his news. It must be so nice to see strangecountries. I wonder if we--I mean Jonathan and I--shall ever see themtogether. There is the ten o’clock bell ringing. Good-bye.“Your loving“MINA.“Tell me all the news when you write. You have not told me anything fora long time. I hear rumours, and especially of a tall, handsome,curly-haired man???”_Letter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Murray_.“_17, Chatham Street_,“_Wednesday_.“My dearest Mina,--“I must say you tax me _very_ unfairly with being a bad correspondent. Iwrote to you _twice_ since we parted, and your last letter was only your_second_. Besides, I have nothing to tell you. There is really nothingto interest you. Town is very pleasant just now, and we go a good dealto picture-galleries and for walks and rides in the park. As to thetall, curly-haired man, I suppose it was the one who was with me at thelast Pop. Some one has evidently been telling tales. That was Mr.Holmwood. He often comes to see us, and he and mamma get on very welltogether; they have so many things to talk about in common. We met sometime ago a man that would just _do for you_, if you were not alreadyengaged to Jonathan. He is an excellent _parti_, being handsome, welloff, and of good birth. He is a doctor and really clever. Just fancy! Heis only nine-and-twenty, and he has an immense lunatic asylum all underhis own care. Mr. Holmwood introduced him to me, and he called here tosee us, and often comes now. I think he is one of the most resolute menI ever saw, and yet the most calm. He seems absolutely imperturbable. Ican fancy what a wonderful power he must have over his patients. He hasa curious habit of looking one straight in the face, as if trying toread one’s thoughts. He tries this on very much with me, but I flattermyself he has got a tough nut to crack. I know that from my glass. Doyou ever try to read your own face? _I do_, and I can tell you it is nota bad study, and gives you more trouble than you can well fancy if youhave never tried it. He says that I afford him a curious psychologicalstudy, and I humbly think I do. I do not, as you know, take sufficientinterest in dress to be able to describe the new fashions. Dress is abore. That is slang again, but never mind; Arthur says that every day.There, it is all out. Mina, we have told all our secrets to each othersince we were _children_; we have slept together and eaten together, andlaughed and cried together; and now, though I have spoken, I would liketo speak more. Oh, Mina, couldn’t you guess? I love him. I am blushingas I write, for although I _think_ he loves me, he has not told me so inwords. But oh, Mina, I love him; I love him; I love him! There, thatdoes me good. I wish I were with you, dear, sitting by the fireundressing, as we used to sit; and I would try to tell you what I feel.I do not know how I am writing this even to you. I am afraid to stop,or I should tear up the letter, and I don’t want to stop, for I _do_ sowant to tell you all. Let me hear from you _at once_, and tell me allthat you think about it. Mina, I must stop. Good-night. Bless me in yourprayers; and, Mina, pray for my happiness.“LUCY.“P.S.--I need not tell you this is a secret. Good-night again.“L.”_Letter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Murray_.“_24 May_.“My dearest Mina,--“Thanks, and thanks, and thanks again for your sweet letter. It was sonice to be able to tell you and to have your sympathy.“My dear, it never rains but it pours. How true the old proverbs are.Here am I, who shall be twenty in September, and yet I never had aproposal till to-day, not a real proposal, and to-day I have had three.Just fancy! THREE proposals in one day! Isn’t it awful! I feel sorry,really and truly sorry, for two of the poor fellows. Oh, Mina, I am sohappy that I don’t know what to do with myself. And three proposals!But, for goodness’ sake, don’t tell any of the girls, or they would begetting all sorts of extravagant ideas and imagining themselves injuredand slighted if in their very first day at home they did not get six atleast. Some girls are so vain! You and I, Mina dear, who are engaged andare going to settle down soon soberly into old married women, candespise vanity. Well, I must tell you about the three, but you must keepit a secret, dear, from _every one_, except, of course, Jonathan. Youwill tell him, because I would, if I were in your place, certainly tellArthur. A woman ought to tell her husband everything--don’t you thinkso, dear?--and I must be fair. Men like women, certainly their wives, tobe quite as fair as they are; and women, I am afraid, are not alwaysquite as fair as they should be. Well, my dear, number One came justbefore lunch. I told you of him, Dr. John Seward, the lunatic-asylumman, with the strong jaw and the good forehead. He was very cooloutwardly, but was nervous all the same. He had evidently been schoolinghimself as to all sorts of little things, and remembered them; but healmost managed to sit down on his silk hat, which men don’t generally dowhen they are cool, and then when he wanted to appear at ease he keptplaying with a lancet in a way that made me nearly scream. He spoke tome, Mina, very straightforwardly. He told me how dear I was to him,though he had known me so little, and what his life would be with me tohelp and cheer him. He was going to tell me how unhappy he would be if Idid not care for him, but when he saw me cry he said that he was a bruteand would not add to my present trouble. Then he broke off and asked ifI could love him in time; and when I shook my head his hands trembled,and then with some hesitation he asked me if I cared already for any oneelse. He put it very nicely, saying that he did not want to wring myconfidence from me, but only to know, because if a woman’s heart wasfree a man might have hope. And then, Mina, I felt a sort of duty totell him that there was some one. I only told him that much, and then hestood up, and he looked very strong and very grave as he took both myhands in his and said he hoped I would be happy, and that if I everwanted a friend I must count him one of my best. Oh, Mina dear, I can’thelp crying: and you must excuse this letter being all blotted. Beingproposed to is all very nice and all that sort of thing, but it isn’t atall a happy thing when you have to see a poor fellow, whom you knowloves you honestly, going away and looking all broken-hearted, and toknow that, no matter what he may say at the moment, you are passingquite out of his life. My dear, I must stop here at present, I feel somiserable, though I am so happy.“_Evening._“Arthur has just gone, and I feel in better spirits than when I leftoff, so I can go on telling you about the day. Well, my dear, number Twocame after lunch. He is such a nice fellow, an American from Texas, andhe looks so young and so fresh that it seems almost impossible that hehas been to so many places and has had such adventures. I sympathisewith poor Desdemona when she had such a dangerous stream poured in herear, even by a black man. I suppose that we women are such cowards thatwe think a man will save us from fears, and we marry him. I know nowwhat I would do if I were a man and wanted to make a girl love me. No, Idon’t, for there was Mr. Morris telling us his stories, and Arthur nevertold any, and yet---- My dear, I am somewhat previous. Mr. Quincey P.Morris found me alone. It seems that a man always does find a girlalone. No, he doesn’t, for Arthur tried twice to _make_ a chance, and Ihelping him all I could; I am not ashamed to say it now. I must tell youbeforehand that Mr. Morris doesn’t always speak slang--that is to say,he never does so to strangers or before them, for he is really welleducated and has exquisite manners--but he found out that it amused meto hear him talk American slang, and whenever I was present, and therewas no one to be shocked, he said such funny things. I am afraid, mydear, he has to invent it all, for it fits exactly into whatever else hehas to say. But this is a way slang has. I do not know myself if I shallever speak slang; I do not know if Arthur likes it, as I have neverheard him use any as yet. Well, Mr. Morris sat down beside me and lookedas happy and jolly as he could, but I could see all the same that he wasvery nervous. He took my hand in his, and said ever so sweetly:--“‘Miss Lucy, I know I ain’t good enough to regulate the fixin’s of yourlittle shoes, but I guess if you wait till you find a man that is youwill go join them seven young women with the lamps when you quit. Won’tyou just hitch up alongside of me and let us go down the long roadtogether, driving in double harness?’“Well, he did look so good-humoured and so jolly that it didn’t seemhalf so hard to refuse him as it did poor Dr. Seward; so I said, aslightly as I could, that I did not know anything of hitching, and that Iwasn’t broken to harness at all yet. Then he said that he had spoken ina light manner, and he hoped that if he had made a mistake in doing soon so grave, so momentous, an occasion for him, I would forgive him. Hereally did look serious when he was saying it, and I couldn’t helpfeeling a bit serious too--I know, Mina, you will think me a horridflirt--though I couldn’t help feeling a sort of exultation that he wasnumber two in one day. And then, my dear, before I could say a word hebegan pouring out a perfect torrent of love-making, laying his veryheart and soul at my feet. He looked so earnest over it that I shallnever again think that a man must be playful always, and never earnest,because he is merry at times. I suppose he saw something in my facewhich checked him, for he suddenly stopped, and said with a sort ofmanly fervour that I could have loved him for if I had been free:--“‘Lucy, you are an honest-hearted girl, I know. I should not be herespeaking to you as I am now if I did not believe you clean grit, rightthrough to the very depths of your soul. Tell me, like one good fellowto another, is there any one else that you care for? And if there isI’ll never trouble you a hair’s breadth again, but will be, if you willlet me, a very faithful friend.’“My dear Mina, why are men so noble when we women are so little worthyof them? Here was I almost making fun of this great-hearted, truegentleman. I burst into tears--I am afraid, my dear, you will thinkthis a very sloppy letter in more ways than one--and I really felt verybadly. Why can’t they let a girl marry three men, or as many as wanther, and save all this trouble? But this is heresy, and I must not sayit. I am glad to say that, though I was crying, I was able to look intoMr. Morris’s brave eyes, and I told him out straight:--“‘Yes, there is some one I love, though he has not told me yet that heeven loves me.’ I was right to speak to him so frankly, for quite alight came into his face, and he put out both his hands and took mine--Ithink I put them into his--and said in a hearty way:--“‘That’s my brave girl. It’s better worth being late for a chance ofwinning you than being in time for any other girl in the world. Don’tcry, my dear. If it’s for me, I’m a hard nut to crack; and I take itstanding up. If that other fellow doesn’t know his happiness, well, he’dbetter look for it soon, or he’ll have to deal with me. Little girl,your honesty and pluck have made me a friend, and that’s rarer than alover; it’s more unselfish anyhow. My dear, I’m going to have a prettylonely walk between this and Kingdom Come. Won’t you give me one kiss?It’ll be something to keep off the darkness now and then. You can, youknow, if you like, for that other good fellow--he must be a good fellow,my dear, and a fine fellow, or you could not love him--hasn’t spokenyet.’ That quite won me, Mina, for it _was_ brave and sweet of him, andnoble, too, to a rival--wasn’t it?--and he so sad; so I leant over andkissed him. He stood up with my two hands in his, and as he looked downinto my face--I am afraid I was blushing very much--he said:--“‘Little girl, I hold your hand, and you’ve kissed me, and if thesethings don’t make us friends nothing ever will. Thank you for your sweethonesty to me, and good-bye.’ He wrung my hand, and taking up his hat,went straight out of the room without looking back, without a tear or aquiver or a pause; and I am crying like a baby. Oh, why must a man likethat be made unhappy when there are lots of girls about who wouldworship the very ground he trod on? I know I would if I were free--onlyI don’t want to be free. My dear, this quite upset me, and I feel Icannot write of happiness just at once, after telling you of it; and Idon’t wish to tell of the number three until it can be all happy.“Ever your loving“LUCY.“P.S.--Oh, about number Three--I needn’t tell you of number Three, needI? Besides, it was all so confused; it seemed only a moment from hiscoming into the room till both his arms were round me, and he waskissing me. I am very, very happy, and I don’t know what I have done todeserve it. I must only try in the future to show that I am notungrateful to God for all His goodness to me in sending to me such alover, such a husband, and such a friend.“Good-bye.”_Dr. Seward’s Diary._(Kept in phonograph)_25 May._--Ebb tide in appetite to-day.

He is so quaint that I amdetermined to understand him as well as I can. To-day I seemed to getnearer than ever before to the heart of his mystery.I questioned him more fully than I had ever done, with a view to makingmyself master of the facts of his hallucination. In my manner of doingit there was, I now see, something of cruelty. I seemed to wish to keephim to the point of his madness--a thing which I avoid with the patientsas I would the mouth of hell.(_Mem._, under what circumstances would I _not_ avoid the pit of hell?)_Omnia Romæ venalia sunt._ Hell has its price! _verb. sap._ If there beanything behind this instinct it will be valuable to trace it afterwards_accurately_, so I had better commence to do so, therefore--R.

I bear messages which will make both your earstingle.“ART.”CHAPTER VIMINA MURRAY’S JOURNAL_24 July. Whitby._--Lucy met me at the station, looking sweeter andlovelier than ever, and we drove up to the house at the Crescent inwhich they have rooms. This is a lovely place. The little river, theEsk, runs through a deep valley, which broadens out as it comes near theharbour. A great viaduct runs across, with high piers, through which theview seems somehow further away than it really is. The valley isbeautifully green, and it is so steep that when you are on the high landon either side you look right across it, unless you are near enough tosee down. The houses of the old town--the side away from us--are allred-roofed, and seem piled up one over the other anyhow, like thepictures we see of Nuremberg. Right over the town is the ruin of WhitbyAbbey, which was sacked by the Danes, and which is the scene of part of“Marmion,” where the girl was built up in the wall. It is a most nobleruin, of immense size, and full of beautiful and romantic bits; there isa legend that a white lady is seen in one of the windows. Between it andthe town there is another church, the parish one, round which is a biggraveyard, all full of tombstones. This is to my mind the nicest spot inWhitby, for it lies right over the town, and has a full view of theharbour and all up the bay to where the headland called Kettlenessstretches out into the sea. It descends so steeply over the harbour thatpart of the bank has fallen away, and some of the graves have beendestroyed. In one place part of the stonework of the graves stretchesout over the sandy pathway far below. There are walks, with seats besidethem, through the churchyard; and people go and sit there all day longlooking at the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze. I shall come andsit here very often myself and work. Indeed, I am writing now, with mybook on my knee, and listening to the talk of three old men who aresitting beside me. They seem to do nothing all day but sit up here andtalk.The harbour lies below me, with, on the far side, one long granite wallstretching out into the sea, with a curve outwards at the end of it, inthe middle of which is a lighthouse. A heavy sea-wall runs along outsideof it. On the near side, the sea-wall makes an elbow crooked inversely,and its end too has a lighthouse. Between the two piers there is anarrow opening into the harbour, which then suddenly widens.It is nice at high water; but when the tide is out it shoals away tonothing, and there is merely the stream of the Esk, running betweenbanks of sand, with rocks here and there. Outside the harbour on thisside there rises for about half a mile a great reef, the sharp edge ofwhich runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse. At the end ofit is a buoy with a bell, which swings in bad weather, and sends in amournful sound on the wind. They have a legend here that when a ship islost bells are heard out at sea. I must ask the old man about this; heis coming this way....He is a funny old man. He must be awfully old, for his face is allgnarled and twisted like the bark of a tree. He tells me that he isnearly a hundred, and that he was a sailor in the Greenland fishingfleet when Waterloo was fought. He is, I am afraid, a very scepticalperson, for when I asked him about the bells at sea and the White Ladyat the abbey he said very brusquely:--“I wouldn’t fash masel’ about them, miss. Them things be all wore out.Mind, I don’t say that they never was, but I do say that they wasn’t inmy time. They be all very well for comers and trippers, an’ the like,but not for a nice young lady like you. Them feet-folks from York andLeeds that be always eatin’ cured herrin’s an’ drinkin’ tea an’ lookin’out to buy cheap jet would creed aught. I wonder masel’ who’d bebothered tellin’ lies to them--even the newspapers, which is full offool-talk.” I thought he would be a good person to learn interestingthings from, so I asked him if he would mind telling me something aboutthe whale-fishing in the old days. He was just settling himself to beginwhen the clock struck six, whereupon he laboured to get up, and said:--“I must gang ageeanwards home now, miss. My grand-daughter doesn’t liketo be kept waitin’ when the tea is ready, for it takes me time tocrammle aboon the grees, for there be a many of ’em; an’, miss, I lackbelly-timber sairly by the clock.”He hobbled away, and I could see him hurrying, as well as he could, downthe steps. The steps are a great feature on the place. They lead fromthe town up to the church, there are hundreds of them--I do not know howmany--and they wind up in a delicate curve; the slope is so gentle thata horse could easily walk up and down them. I think they must originallyhave had something to do with the abbey. I shall go home too. Lucy wentout visiting with her mother, and as they were only duty calls, I didnot go. They will be home by this.*       *       *       *       *_1 August._--I came up here an hour ago with Lucy, and we had a mostinteresting talk with my old friend and the two others who always comeand join him. He is evidently the Sir Oracle of them, and I should thinkmust have been in his time a most dictatorial person. He will not admitanything, and downfaces everybody. If he can’t out-argue them he bulliesthem, and then takes their silence for agreement with his views. Lucywas looking sweetly pretty in her white lawn frock; she has got abeautiful colour since she has been here. I noticed that the old men didnot lose any time in coming up and sitting near her when we sat down.She is so sweet with old people; I think they all fell in love with heron the spot. Even my old man succumbed and did not contradict her, butgave me double share instead. I got him on the subject of the legends,and he went off at once into a sort of sermon. I must try to remember itand put it down:--“It be all fool-talk, lock, stock, and barrel; that’s what it be, an’nowt else. These bans an’ wafts an’ boh-ghosts an’ barguests an’ boglesan’ all anent them is only fit to set bairns an’ dizzy womena-belderin’. They be nowt but air-blebs. They, an’ all grims an’ signsan’ warnin’s, be all invented by parsons an’ illsome beuk-bodies an’railway touters to skeer an’ scunner hafflin’s, an’ to get folks to dosomethin’ that they don’t other incline to. It makes me ireful to thinko’ them. Why, it’s them that, not content with printin’ lies on paperan’ preachin’ them out of pulpits, does want to be cuttin’ them on thetombstones. Look here all around you in what airt ye will; all themsteans, holdin’ up their heads as well as they can out of their pride,is acant--simply tumblin’ down with the weight o’ the lies wrote onthem, ‘Here lies the body’ or ‘Sacred to the memory’ wrote on all ofthem, an’ yet in nigh half of them there bean’t no bodies at all; an’the memories of them bean’t cared a pinch of snuff about, much lesssacred. Lies all of them, nothin’ but lies of one kind or another! Mygog, but it’ll be a quare scowderment at the Day of Judgment when theycome tumblin’ up in their death-sarks, all jouped together an’ tryin’ todrag their tombsteans with them to prove how good they was; some of themtrimmlin’ and ditherin’, with their hands that dozzened an’ slippy fromlyin’ in the sea that they can’t even keep their grup o’ them.”I could see from the old fellow’s self-satisfied air and the way inwhich he looked round for the approval of his cronies that he was“showing off,” so I put in a word to keep him going:--“Oh, Mr. Swales, you can’t be serious. Surely these tombstones are notall wrong?”“Yabblins! There may be a poorish few not wrong, savin’ where they makeout the people too good; for there be folk that do think a balm-bowl belike the sea, if only it be their own. The whole thing be only lies. Nowlook you here; you come here a stranger, an’ you see this kirk-garth.” Inodded, for I thought it better to assent, though I did not quiteunderstand his dialect. I knew it had something to do with the church.He went on: “And you consate that all these steans be aboon folk that behapped here, snod an’ snog?” I assented again. “Then that be just wherethe lie comes in. Why, there be scores of these lay-beds that be toom asold Dun’s ’bacca-box on Friday night.” He nudged one of his companions,and they all laughed. “And my gog! how could they be otherwise? Look atthat one, the aftest abaft the bier-bank: read it!” I went over andread:--“Edward Spencelagh, master mariner, murdered by pirates off the coast ofAndres, April, 1854, æt. 30.” When I came back Mr. Swales went on:--“Who brought him home, I wonder, to hap him here? Murdered off the coastof Andres! an’ you consated his body lay under! Why, I could name ye adozen whose bones lie in the Greenland seas above”--he pointednorthwards--“or where the currents may have drifted them. There be thesteans around ye. Ye can, with your young eyes, read the small-print ofthe lies from here. This Braithwaite Lowrey--I knew his father, lost inthe _Lively_ off Greenland in ’20; or Andrew Woodhouse, drowned in thesame seas in 1777; or John Paxton, drowned off Cape Farewell a yearlater; or old John Rawlings, whose grandfather sailed with me, drownedin the Gulf of Finland in ’50. Do ye think that all these men will haveto make a rush to Whitby when the trumpet sounds? I have me antherumsaboot it! I tell ye that when they got here they’d be jommlin’ an’jostlin’ one another that way that it ’ud be like a fight up on the icein the old days, when we’d be at one another from daylight to dark, an’tryin’ to tie up our cuts by the light of the aurora borealis.” This wasevidently local pleasantry, for the old man cackled over it, and hiscronies joined in with gusto.“But,” I said, “surely you are not quite correct, for you start on theassumption that all the poor people, or their spirits, will have totake their tombstones with them on the Day of Judgment. Do you thinkthat will be really necessary?”“Well, what else be they tombstones for? Answer me that, miss!”“To please their relatives, I suppose.”“To please their relatives, you suppose!” This he said with intensescorn. “How will it pleasure their relatives to know that lies is wroteover them, and that everybody in the place knows that they be lies?” Hepointed to a stone at our feet which had been laid down as a slab, onwhich the seat was rested, close to the edge of the cliff. “Read thelies on that thruff-stean,” he said. The letters were upside down to mefrom where I sat, but Lucy was more opposite to them, so she leant overand read:--“Sacred to the memory of George Canon, who died, in the hope of aglorious resurrection, on July, 29, 1873, falling from the rocks atKettleness. This tomb was erected by his sorrowing mother to her dearlybeloved son. ‘He was the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.’Really, Mr. Swales, I don’t see anything very funny in that!” She spokeher comment very gravely and somewhat severely.“Ye don’t see aught funny! Ha! ha! But that’s because ye don’t gawm thesorrowin’ mother was a hell-cat that hated him because he wasacrewk’d--a regular lamiter he was--an’ he hated her so that hecommitted suicide in order that she mightn’t get an insurance she put onhis life. He blew nigh the top of his head off with an old musket thatthey had for scarin’ the crows with. ’Twarn’t for crows then, for itbrought the clegs and the dowps to him. That’s the way he fell off therocks. And, as to hopes of a glorious resurrection, I’ve often heard himsay masel’ that he hoped he’d go to hell, for his mother was so piousthat she’d be sure to go to heaven, an’ he didn’t want to addle whereshe was. Now isn’t that stean at any rate”--he hammered it with hisstick as he spoke--“a pack of lies? and won’t it make Gabriel kecklewhen Geordie comes pantin’ up the grees with the tombstean balanced onhis hump, and asks it to be took as evidence!”I did not know what to say, but Lucy turned the conversation as shesaid, rising up:--“Oh, why did you tell us of this? It is my favourite seat, and I cannotleave it; and now I find I must go on sitting over the grave of asuicide.”“That won’t harm ye, my pretty; an’ it may make poor Geordie gladsome tohave so trim a lass sittin’ on his lap. That won’t hurt ye. Why, I’vesat here off an’ on for nigh twenty years past, an’ it hasn’t done meno harm. Don’t ye fash about them as lies under ye, or that doesn’ liethere either! It’ll be time for ye to be getting scart when ye see thetombsteans all run away with, and the place as bare as a stubble-field.There’s the clock, an’ I must gang. My service to ye, ladies!” And offhe hobbled.Lucy and I sat awhile, and it was all so beautiful before us that wetook hands as we sat; and she told me all over again about Arthur andtheir coming marriage. That made me just a little heart-sick, for Ihaven’t heard from Jonathan for a whole month.*       *       *       *       *_The same day._ I came up here alone, for I am very sad. There was noletter for me. I hope there cannot be anything the matter with Jonathan.The clock has just struck nine. I see the lights scattered all over thetown, sometimes in rows where the streets are, and sometimes singly;they run right up the Esk and die away in the curve of the valley. To myleft the view is cut off by a black line of roof of the old house nextthe abbey. The sheep and lambs are bleating in the fields away behindme, and there is a clatter of a donkey’s hoofs up the paved road below.The band on the pier is playing a harsh waltz in good time, and furtheralong the quay there is a Salvation Army meeting in a back street.Neither of the bands hears the other, but up here I hear and see themboth. I wonder where Jonathan is and if he is thinking of me! I wish hewere here._Dr. Seward’s Diary.__5 June._--The case of Renfield grows more interesting the more I get tounderstand the man. He has certain qualities very largely developed;selfishness, secrecy, and purpose. I wish I could get at what is theobject of the latter. He seems to have some settled scheme of his own,but what it is I do not yet know. His redeeming quality is a love ofanimals, though, indeed, he has such curious turns in it that Isometimes imagine he is only abnormally cruel. His pets are of oddsorts. Just now his hobby is catching flies. He has at present such aquantity that I have had myself to expostulate. To my astonishment, hedid not break out into a fury, as I expected, but took the matter insimple seriousness. He thought for a moment, and then said: “May I havethree days? I shall clear them away.” Of course, I said that would do. Imust watch him.*       *       *       *       *_18 June._--He has turned his mind now to spiders, and has got severalvery big fellows in a box. He keeps feeding them with his flies, andthe number of the latter is becoming sensibly diminished, although hehas used half his food in attracting more flies from outside to hisroom.*       *       *       *       *_1 July._--His spiders are now becoming as great a nuisance as hisflies, and to-day I told him that he must get rid of them. He lookedvery sad at this, so I said that he must clear out some of them, at allevents. He cheerfully acquiesced in this, and I gave him the same timeas before for reduction. He disgusted me much while with him, for when ahorrid blow-fly, bloated with some carrion food, buzzed into the room,he caught it, held it exultantly for a few moments between his fingerand thumb, and, before I knew what he was going to do, put it in hismouth and ate it. I scolded him for it, but he argued quietly that itwas very good and very wholesome; that it was life, strong life, andgave life to him. This gave me an idea, or the rudiment of one. I mustwatch how he gets rid of his spiders. He has evidently some deep problemin his mind, for he keeps a little note-book in which he is alwaysjotting down something. Whole pages of it are filled with masses offigures, generally single numbers added up in batches, and then thetotals added in batches again, as though he were “focussing” someaccount, as the auditors put it.*       *       *       *       *_8 July._--There is a method in his madness, and the rudimentary idea inmy mind is growing. It will be a whole idea soon, and then, oh,unconscious cerebration! you will have to give the wall to yourconscious brother. I kept away from my friend for a few days, so that Imight notice if there were any change. Things remain as they were exceptthat he has parted with some of his pets and got a new one. He hasmanaged to get a sparrow, and has already partially tamed it. His meansof taming is simple, for already the spiders have diminished. Those thatdo remain, however, are well fed, for he still brings in the flies bytempting them with his food.*       *       *       *       *_19 July._--We are progressing. My friend has now a whole colony ofsparrows, and his flies and spiders are almost obliterated. When I camein he ran to me and said he wanted to ask me a great favour--a very,very great favour; and as he spoke he fawned on me like a dog. I askedhim what it was, and he said, with a sort of rapture in his voice andbearing:--“A kitten, a nice little, sleek playful kitten, that I can play with,and teach, and feed--and feed--and feed!” I was not unprepared for thisrequest, for I had noticed how his pets went on increasing in size andvivacity, but I did not care that his pretty family of tame sparrowsshould be wiped out in the same manner as the flies and the spiders; soI said I would see about it, and asked him if he would not rather have acat than a kitten. His eagerness betrayed him as he answered:--“Oh, yes, I would like a cat! I only asked for a kitten lest you shouldrefuse me a cat. No one would refuse me a kitten, would they?” I shookmy head, and said that at present I feared it would not be possible, butthat I would see about it. His face fell, and I could see a warning ofdanger in it, for there was a sudden fierce, sidelong look which meantkilling. The man is an undeveloped homicidal maniac. I shall test himwith his present craving and see how it will work out; then I shall knowmore.*       *       *       *       *_10 p. m._--I have visited him again and found him sitting in a cornerbrooding. When I came in he threw himself on his knees before me andimplored me to let him have a cat; that his salvation depended upon it.I was firm, however, and told him that he could not have it, whereuponhe went without a word, and sat down, gnawing his fingers, in the cornerwhere I had found him. I shall see him in the morning early.*       *       *       *       *_20 July._--Visited Renfield very early, before the attendant went hisrounds. Found him up and humming a tune. He was spreading out his sugar,which he had saved, in the window, and was manifestly beginning hisfly-catching again; and beginning it cheerfully and with a good grace. Ilooked around for his birds, and not seeing them, asked him where theywere. He replied, without turning round, that they had all flown away.There were a few feathers about the room and on his pillow a drop ofblood. I said nothing, but went and told the keeper to report to me ifthere were anything odd about him during the day.*       *       *       *       *_11 a. m._--The attendant has just been to me to say that Renfield hasbeen very sick and has disgorged a whole lot of feathers. “My belief is,doctor,” he said, “that he has eaten his birds, and that he just tookand ate them raw!”*       *       *       *       *_11 p. m._--I gave Renfield a strong opiate to-night, enough to makeeven him sleep, and took away his pocket-book to look at it. The thoughtthat has been buzzing about my brain lately is complete, and the theoryproved. My homicidal maniac is of a peculiar kind. I shall have toinvent a new classification for him, and call him a zoöphagous(life-eating) maniac; what he desires is to absorb as many lives as hecan, and he has laid himself out to achieve it in a cumulative way. Hegave many flies to one spider and many spiders to one bird, and thenwanted a cat to eat the many birds. What would have been his latersteps? It would almost be worth while to complete the experiment. Itmight be done if there were only a sufficient cause. Men sneered atvivisection, and yet look at its results to-day! Why not advance sciencein its most difficult and vital aspect--the knowledge of the brain? HadI even the secret of one such mind--did I hold the key to the fancy ofeven one lunatic--I might advance my own branch of science to a pitchcompared with which Burdon-Sanderson’s physiology or Ferrier’sbrain-knowledge would be as nothing. If only there were a sufficientcause! I must not think too much of this, or I may be tempted; a goodcause might turn the scale with me, for may not I too be of anexceptional brain, congenitally?How well the man reasoned; lunatics always do within their own scope. Iwonder at how many lives he values a man, or if at only one. He hasclosed the account most accurately, and to-day begun a new record. Howmany of us begin a new record with each day of our lives?To me it seems only yesterday that my whole life ended with my new hope,and that truly I began a new record. So it will be until the GreatRecorder sums me up and closes my ledger account with a balance toprofit or loss. Oh, Lucy, Lucy, I cannot be angry with you, nor can I beangry with my friend whose happiness is yours; but I must only wait onhopeless and work. Work! work!If I only could have as strong a cause as my poor mad friend there--agood, unselfish cause to make me work--that would be indeed happiness._Mina Murray’s Journal.__26 July._--I am anxious, and it soothes me to express myself here; itis like whispering to one’s self and listening at the same time. Andthere is also something about the shorthand symbols that makes itdifferent from writing. I am unhappy about Lucy and about Jonathan. Ihad not heard from Jonathan for some time, and was very concerned; butyesterday dear Mr. Hawkins, who is always so kind, sent me a letter fromhim. I had written asking him if he had heard, and he said the enclosedhad just been received. It is only a line dated from Castle Dracula,and says that he is just starting for home. That is not like Jonathan;I do not understand it, and it makes me uneasy. Then, too, Lucy,although she is so well, has lately taken to her old habit of walking inher sleep. Her mother has spoken to me about it, and we have decidedthat I am to lock the door of our room every night. Mrs. Westenra hasgot an idea that sleep-walkers always go out on roofs of houses andalong the edges of cliffs and then get suddenly wakened and fall overwith a despairing cry that echoes all over the place. Poor dear, she isnaturally anxious about Lucy, and she tells me that her husband, Lucy’sfather, had the same habit; that he would get up in the night and dresshimself and go out, if he were not stopped. Lucy is to be married in theautumn, and she is already planning out her dresses and how her house isto be arranged. I sympathise with her, for I do the same, only Jonathanand I will start in life in a very simple way, and shall have to try tomake both ends meet. Mr. Holmwood--he is the Hon. Arthur Holmwood, onlyson of Lord Godalming--is coming up here very shortly--as soon as he canleave town, for his father is not very well, and I think dear Lucy iscounting the moments till he comes. She wants to take him up to the seaton the churchyard cliff and show him the beauty of Whitby. I daresay itis the waiting which disturbs her; she will be all right when hearrives.*       *       *       *       *_27 July._--No news from Jonathan. I am getting quite uneasy about him,though why I should I do not know; but I do wish that he would write, ifit were only a single line. Lucy walks more than ever, and each night Iam awakened by her moving about the room. Fortunately, the weather is sohot that she cannot get cold; but still the anxiety and the perpetuallybeing wakened is beginning to tell on me, and I am getting nervous andwakeful myself. Thank God, Lucy’s health keeps up. Mr. Holmwood has beensuddenly called to Ring to see his father, who has been taken seriouslyill. Lucy frets at the postponement of seeing him, but it does not touchher looks; she is a trifle stouter, and her cheeks are a lovelyrose-pink. She has lost that anæmic look which she had. I pray it willall last.*       *       *       *       *_3 August._--Another week gone, and no news from Jonathan, not even toMr. Hawkins, from whom I have heard. Oh, I do hope he is not ill. Hesurely would have written. I look at that last letter of his, butsomehow it does not satisfy me. It does not read like him, and yet it ishis writing. There is no mistake of that. Lucy has not walked much inher sleep the last week, but there is an odd concentration about herwhich I do not understand; even in her sleep she seems to be watchingme. She tries the door, and finding it locked, goes about the roomsearching for the key._6 August._--Another three days, and no news. This suspense is gettingdreadful. If I only knew where to write to or where to go to, I shouldfeel easier; but no one has heard a word of Jonathan since that lastletter. I must only pray to God for patience. Lucy is more excitablethan ever, but is otherwise well. Last night was very threatening, andthe fishermen say that we are in for a storm. I must try to watch it andlearn the weather signs. To-day is a grey day, and the sun as I write ishidden in thick clouds, high over Kettleness. Everything is grey--exceptthe green grass, which seems like emerald amongst it; grey earthy rock;grey clouds, tinged with the sunburst at the far edge, hang over thegrey sea, into which the sand-points stretch like grey fingers. The seais tumbling in over the shallows and the sandy flats with a roar,muffled in the sea-mists drifting inland. The horizon is lost in a greymist. All is vastness; the clouds are piled up like giant rocks, andthere is a “brool” over the sea that sounds like some presage of doom.Dark figures are on the beach here and there, sometimes half shrouded inthe mist, and seem “men like trees walking.” The fishing-boats areracing for home, and rise and dip in the ground swell as they sweep intothe harbour, bending to the scuppers. Here comes old Mr. Swales. He ismaking straight for me, and I can see, by the way he lifts his hat, thathe wants to talk....I have been quite touched by the change in the poor old man. When he satdown beside me, he said in a very gentle way:--“I want to say something to you, miss.” I could see he was not at ease,so I took his poor old wrinkled hand in mine and asked him to speakfully; so he said, leaving his hand in mine:--“I’m afraid, my deary, that I must have shocked you by all the wickedthings I’ve been sayin’ about the dead, and such like, for weeks past;but I didn’t mean them, and I want ye to remember that when I’m gone. Weaud folks that be daffled, and with one foot abaft the krok-hooal, don’taltogether like to think of it, and we don’t want to feel scart of it;an’ that’s why I’ve took to makin’ light of it, so that I’d cheer up myown heart a bit. But, Lord love ye, miss, I ain’t afraid of dyin’, not abit; only I don’t want to die if I can help it. My time must be nigh athand now, for I be aud, and a hundred years is too much for any man toexpect; and I’m so nigh it that the Aud Man is already whettin’ hisscythe. Ye see, I can’t get out o’ the habit of caffin’ about it all atonce; the chafts will wag as they be used to. Some day soon the Angel ofDeath will sound his trumpet for me. But don’t ye dooal an’ greet, mydeary!”--for he saw that I was crying--“if he should come this verynight I’d not refuse to answer his call. For life be, after all, only awaitin’ for somethin’ else than what we’re doin’; and death be all thatwe can rightly depend on. But I’m content, for it’s comin’ to me, mydeary, and comin’ quick. It may be comin’ while we be lookin’ andwonderin’. Maybe it’s in that wind out over the sea that’s bringin’ withit loss and wreck, and sore distress, and sad hearts. Look! look!” hecried suddenly. “There’s something in that wind and in the hoast beyontthat sounds, and looks, and tastes, and smells like death. It’s in theair; I feel it comin’. Lord, make me answer cheerful when my callcomes!” He held up his arms devoutly, and raised his hat. His mouthmoved as though he were praying. After a few minutes’ silence, he gotup, shook hands with me, and blessed me, and said good-bye, and hobbledoff. It all touched me, and upset me very much.I was glad when the coastguard came along, with his spy-glass under hisarm. He stopped to talk with me, as he always does, but all the timekept looking at a strange ship.“I can’t make her out,” he said; “she’s a Russian, by the look of her;but she’s knocking about in the queerest way. She doesn’t know her minda bit; she seems to see the storm coming, but can’t decide whether torun up north in the open, or to put in here. Look there again! She issteered mighty strangely, for she doesn’t mind the hand on the wheel;changes about with every puff of wind. We’ll hear more of her beforethis time to-morrow.”CHAPTER VIICUTTING FROM “THE DAILYGRAPH,” 8 AUGUST(_Pasted in Mina Murray’s Journal._)From a Correspondent._Whitby_.One of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has just beenexperienced here, with results both strange and unique. The weather hadbeen somewhat sultry, but not to any degree uncommon in the month ofAugust. Saturday evening was as fine as was ever known, and the greatbody of holiday-makers laid out yesterday for visits to Mulgrave Woods,Robin Hood’s Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and the various trips inthe neighbourhood of Whitby. The steamers _Emma_ and _Scarborough_ madetrips up and down the coast, and there was an unusual amount of“tripping” both to and from Whitby. The day was unusually fine till theafternoon, when some of the gossips who frequent the East Cliffchurchyard, and from that commanding eminence watch the wide sweep ofsea visible to the north and east, called attention to a sudden show of“mares’-tails” high in the sky to the north-west. The wind was thenblowing from the south-west in the mild degree which in barometricallanguage is ranked “No. 2: light breeze.” The coastguard on duty at oncemade report, and one old fisherman, who for more than half a century haskept watch on weather signs from the East Cliff, foretold in an emphaticmanner the coming of a sudden storm. The approach of sunset was so verybeautiful, so grand in its masses of splendidly-coloured clouds, thatthere was quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the oldchurchyard to enjoy the beauty. Before the sun dipped below the blackmass of Kettleness, standing boldly athwart the western sky, itsdownward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunset-colour--flame,purple, pink, green, violet, and all the tints of gold; with here andthere masses not large, but of seemingly absolute blackness, in allsorts of shapes, as well outlined as colossal silhouettes. Theexperience was not lost on the painters, and doubtless some of thesketches of the “Prelude to the Great Storm” will grace the R. A. and R.I. walls in May next. More than one captain made up his mind then andthere that his “cobble” or his “mule,” as they term the differentclasses of boats, would remain in the harbour till the storm had passed.The wind fell away entirely during the evening, and at midnight therewas a dead calm, a sultry heat, and that prevailing intensity which, onthe approach of thunder, affects persons of a sensitive nature. Therewere but few lights in sight at sea, for even the coasting steamers,which usually “hug” the shore so closely, kept well to seaward, and butfew fishing-boats were in sight. The only sail noticeable was a foreignschooner with all sails set, which was seemingly going westwards. Thefoolhardiness or ignorance of her officers was a prolific theme forcomment whilst she remained in sight, and efforts were made to signalher to reduce sail in face of her danger. Before the night shut down shewas seen with sails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulatingswell of the sea,“As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean.”Shortly before ten o’clock the stillness of the air grew quiteoppressive, and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a sheepinland or the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly heard, and theband on the pier, with its lively French air, was like a discord in thegreat harmony of nature’s silence. A little after midnight came astrange sound from over the sea, and high overhead the air began tocarry a strange, faint, hollow booming.Then without warning the tempest broke. With a rapidity which, at thetime, seemed incredible, and even afterwards is impossible to realize,the whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed. The waves rose ingrowing fury, each overtopping its fellow, till in a very few minutesthe lately glassy sea was like a roaring and devouring monster.White-crested waves beat madly on the level sands and rushed up theshelving cliffs; others broke over the piers, and with their spume sweptthe lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise from the end of either pierof Whitby Harbour. The wind roared like thunder, and blew with suchforce that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept their feet,or clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions. It was found necessaryto clear the entire piers from the mass of onlookers, or else thefatalities of the night would have been increased manifold. To add tothe difficulties and dangers of the time, masses of sea-fog camedrifting inland--white, wet clouds, which swept by in ghostly fashion,so dank and damp and cold that it needed but little effort ofimagination to think that the spirits of those lost at sea weretouching their living brethren with the clammy hands of death, and manya one shuddered as the wreaths of sea-mist swept by. At times the mistcleared, and the sea for some distance could be seen in the glare of thelightning, which now came thick and fast, followed by such sudden pealsof thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shockof the footsteps of the storm.Some of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and ofabsorbing interest--the sea, running mountains high, threw skywards witheach wave mighty masses of white foam, which the tempest seemed tosnatch at and whirl away into space; here and there a fishing-boat, witha rag of sail, running madly for shelter before the blast; now and againthe white wings of a storm-tossed sea-bird. On the summit of the EastCliff the new searchlight was ready for experiment, but had not yet beentried. The officers in charge of it got it into working order, and inthe pauses of the inrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea.Once or twice its service was most effective, as when a fishing-boat,with gunwale under water, rushed into the harbour, able, by the guidanceof the sheltering light, to avoid the danger of dashing against thepiers. As each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout ofjoy from the mass of people on shore, a shout which for a moment seemedto cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush.Before long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schoonerwith all sails set, apparently the same vessel which had been noticedearlier in the evening. The wind had by this time backed to the east,and there was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as theyrealized the terrible danger in which she now was. Between her and theport lay the great flat reef on which so many good ships have from timeto time suffered, and, with the wind blowing from its present quarter,it would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of theharbour. It was now nearly the hour of high tide, but the waves were sogreat that in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almostvisible, and the schooner, with all sails set, was rushing with suchspeed that, in the words of one old salt, “she must fetch up somewhere,if it was only in hell.” Then came another rush of sea-fog, greater thanany hitherto--a mass of dank mist, which seemed to close on all thingslike a grey pall, and left available to men only the organ of hearing,for the roar of the tempest, and the crash of the thunder, and thebooming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion even louderthan before. The rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbourmouth across the East Pier, where the shock was expected, and men waitedbreathless. The wind suddenly shifted to the north-east, and the remnantof the sea-fog melted in the blast; and then, _mirabile dictu_, betweenthe piers, leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed,swept the strange schooner before the blast, with all sail set, andgained the safety of the harbour. The searchlight followed her, and ashudder ran through all who saw her, for lashed to the helm was acorpse, with drooping head, which swung horribly to and fro at eachmotion of the ship. No other form could be seen on deck at all. A greatawe came on all as they realised that the ship, as if by a miracle, hadfound the harbour, unsteered save by the hand of a dead man! However,all took place more quickly than it takes to write these words. Theschooner paused not, but rushing across the harbour, pitched herself onthat accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and manystorms into the south-east corner of the pier jutting under the EastCliff, known locally as Tate Hill Pier.There was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up onthe sand heap. Every spar, rope, and stay was strained, and some of the“top-hammer” came crashing down. But, strangest of all, the very instantthe shore was touched, an immense dog sprang up on deck from below, asif shot up by the concussion, and running forward, jumped from the bowon the sand. Making straight for the steep cliff, where the churchyardhangs over the laneway to the East Pier so steeply that some of the flattombstones--“thruff-steans” or “through-stones,” as they call them inthe Whitby vernacular--actually project over where the sustaining cliffhas fallen away, it disappeared in the darkness, which seemedintensified just beyond the focus of the searchlight.It so happened that there was no one at the moment on Tate Hill Pier, asall those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or wereout on the heights above. Thus the coastguard on duty on the easternside of the harbour, who at once ran down to the little pier, was thefirst to climb on board. The men working the searchlight, after scouringthe entrance of the harbour without seeing anything, then turned thelight on the derelict and kept it there. The coastguard ran aft, andwhen he came beside the wheel, bent over to examine it, and recoiled atonce as though under some sudden emotion. This seemed to pique generalcuriosity, and quite a number of people began to run. It is a good wayround from the West Cliff by the Drawbridge to Tate Hill Pier, but yourcorrespondent is a fairly good runner, and came well ahead of the crowd.When I arrived, however, I found already assembled on the pier a crowd,whom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board. By thecourtesy of the chief boatman, I was, as your correspondent, permittedto climb on deck, and was one of a small group who saw the dead seamanwhilst actually lashed to the wheel.It was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised, or even awed, fornot often can such a sight have been seen. The man was simply fastenedby his hands, tied one over the other, to a spoke of the wheel. Betweenthe inner hand and the wood was a crucifix, the set of beads on which itwas fastened being around both wrists and wheel, and all kept fast bythe binding cords. The poor fellow may have been seated at one time, butthe flapping and buffeting of the sails had worked through the rudder ofthe wheel and dragged him to and fro, so that the cords with which hewas tied had cut the flesh to the bone. Accurate note was made of thestate of things, and a doctor--Surgeon J. M. Caffyn, of 33, East ElliotPlace--who came immediately after me, declared, after makingexamination, that the man must have been dead for quite two days. In hispocket was a bottle, carefully corked, empty save for a little roll ofpaper, which proved to be the addendum to the log. The coastguard saidthe man must have tied up his own hands, fastening the knots with histeeth. The fact that a coastguard was the first on board may save somecomplications, later on, in the Admiralty Court; for coastguards cannotclaim the salvage which is the right of the first civilian entering on aderelict. Already, however, the legal tongues are wagging, and one younglaw student is loudly asserting that the rights of the owner are alreadycompletely sacrificed, his property being held in contravention of thestatutes of mortmain, since the tiller, as emblemship, if not proof, ofdelegated possession, is held in a _dead hand_. It is needless to saythat the dead steersman has been reverently removed from the place wherehe held his honourable watch and ward till death--a steadfastness asnoble as that of the young Casabianca--and placed in the mortuary toawait inquest.Already the sudden storm is passing, and its fierceness is abating;crowds are scattering homeward, and the sky is beginning to redden overthe Yorkshire wolds. I shall send, in time for your next issue, furtherdetails of the derelict ship which found her way so miraculously intoharbour in the storm._Whitby__9 August._--The sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in thestorm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself. Itturns out that the schooner is a Russian from Varna, and is called the_Demeter_. She is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand, with only asmall amount of cargo--a number of great wooden boxes filled with mould.This cargo was consigned to a Whitby solicitor, Mr. S. F. Billington, of7, The Crescent, who this morning went aboard and formally tookpossession of the goods consigned to him. The Russian consul, too,acting for the charter-party, took formal possession of the ship, andpaid all harbour dues, etc. Nothing is talked about here to-day exceptthe strange coincidence; the officials of the Board of Trade have beenmost exacting in seeing that every compliance has been made withexisting regulations. As the matter is to be a “nine days’ wonder,” theyare evidently determined that there shall be no cause of aftercomplaint. A good deal of interest was abroad concerning the dog whichlanded when the ship struck, and more than a few of the members of theS. P. C. A., which is very strong in Whitby, have tried to befriend theanimal. To the general disappointment, however, it was not to be found;it seems to have disappeared entirely from the town. It may be that itwas frightened and made its way on to the moors, where it is stillhiding in terror. There are some who look with dread on such apossibility, lest later on it should in itself become a danger, for itis evidently a fierce brute. Early this morning a large dog, a half-bredmastiff belonging to a coal merchant close to Tate Hill Pier, was founddead in the roadway opposite to its master’s yard. It had been fighting,and manifestly had had a savage opponent, for its throat was torn away,and its belly was slit open as if with a savage claw.*       *       *       *       *_Later._--By the kindness of the Board of Trade inspector, I have beenpermitted to look over the log-book of the _Demeter_, which was in orderup to within three days, but contained nothing of special interestexcept as to facts of missing men. The greatest interest, however, iswith regard to the paper found in the bottle, which was to-day producedat the inquest; and a more strange narrative than the two between themunfold it has not been my lot to come across. As there is no motive forconcealment, I am permitted to use them, and accordingly send you arescript, simply omitting technical details of seamanship andsupercargo. It almost seems as though the captain had been seized withsome kind of mania before he had got well into blue water, and thatthis had developed persistently throughout the voyage. Of course mystatement must be taken _cum grano_, since I am writing from thedictation of a clerk of the Russian consul, who kindly translated forme, time being short.LOG OF THE “DEMETER.”_Varna to Whitby.__Written 18 July, things so strange happening, that I shall keepaccurate note henceforth till we land._*       *       *       *       *On 6 July we finished taking in cargo, silver sand and boxes of earth.At noon set sail. East wind, fresh. Crew, five hands ... two mates,cook, and myself (captain).*       *       *       *       *On 11 July at dawn entered Bosphorus. Boarded by Turkish Customsofficers. Backsheesh. All correct. Under way at 4 p. m.*       *       *       *       *On 12 July through Dardanelles. More Customs officers and flagboat ofguarding squadron. Backsheesh again. Work of officers thorough, butquick. Want us off soon. At dark passed into Archipelago.*       *       *       *       *On 13 July passed Cape Matapan. Crew dissatisfied about something.Seemed scared, but would not speak out.*       *       *       *       *On 14 July was somewhat anxious about crew. Men all steady fellows, whosailed with me before. Mate could not make out what was wrong; they onlytold him there was _something_, and crossed themselves. Mate lost temperwith one of them that day and struck him. Expected fierce quarrel, butall was quiet.*       *       *       *       *On 16 July mate reported in the morning that one of crew, Petrofsky, wasmissing. Could not account for it. Took larboard watch eight bells lastnight; was relieved by Abramoff, but did not go to bunk. Men moredowncast than ever. All said they expected something of the kind, butwould not say more than there was _something_ aboard. Mate getting veryimpatient with them; feared some trouble ahead.*       *       *       *       *On 17 July, yesterday, one of the men, Olgaren, came to my cabin, and inan awestruck way confided to me that he thought there was a strange manaboard the ship. He said that in his watch he had been shelteringbehind the deck-house, as there was a rain-storm, when he saw a tall,thin man, who was not like any of the crew, come up the companion-way,and go along the deck forward, and disappear. He followed cautiously,but when he got to bows found no one, and the hatchways were all closed.He was in a panic of superstitious fear, and I am afraid the panic mayspread. To allay it, I shall to-day search entire ship carefully fromstem to stern.*       *       *       *       *Later in the day I got together the whole crew, and told them, as theyevidently thought there was some one in the ship, we would search fromstem to stern. First mate angry; said it was folly, and to yield to suchfoolish ideas would demoralise the men; said he would engage to keepthem out of trouble with a handspike. I let him take the helm, while therest began thorough search, all keeping abreast, with lanterns: we leftno corner unsearched. As there were only the big wooden boxes, therewere no odd corners where a man could hide. Men much relieved whensearch over, and went back to work cheerfully. First mate scowled, butsaid nothing.*       *       *       *       *_22 July_.--Rough weather last three days, and all hands busy withsails--no time to be frightened. Men seem to have forgotten their dread.Mate cheerful again, and all on good terms. Praised men for work in badweather. Passed Gibralter and out through Straits. All well.*       *       *       *       *_24 July_.--There seems some doom over this ship. Already a hand short,and entering on the Bay of Biscay with wild weather ahead, and yet lastnight another man lost--disappeared. Like the first, he came off hiswatch and was not seen again. Men all in a panic of fear; sent a roundrobin, asking to have double watch, as they fear to be alone. Mateangry. Fear there will be some trouble, as either he or the men will dosome violence.*       *       *       *       *_28 July_.--Four days in hell, knocking about in a sort of maelstrom,and the wind a tempest. No sleep for any one. Men all worn out. Hardlyknow how to set a watch, since no one fit to go on. Second matevolunteered to steer and watch, and let men snatch a few hours’ sleep.Wind abating; seas still terrific, but feel them less, as ship issteadier.*       *       *       *       *_29 July_.--Another tragedy. Had single watch to-night, as crew tootired to double. When morning watch came on deck could find no oneexcept steersman. Raised outcry, and all came on deck. Thorough search,but no one found. Are now without second mate, and crew in a panic. Mateand I agreed to go armed henceforth and wait for any sign of cause.*       *       *       *       *_30 July_.--Last night. Rejoiced we are nearing England. Weather fine,all sails set. Retired worn out; slept soundly; awaked by mate tellingme that both man of watch and steersman missing. Only self and mate andtwo hands left to work ship.*       *       *       *       *_1 August_.--Two days of fog, and not a sail sighted. Had hoped when inthe English Channel to be able to signal for help or get in somewhere.Not having power to work sails, have to run before wind. Dare not lower,as could not raise them again. We seem to be drifting to some terribledoom. Mate now more demoralised than either of men. His stronger natureseems to have worked inwardly against himself. Men are beyond fear,working stolidly and patiently, with minds made up to worst. They areRussian, he Roumanian.*       *       *       *       *_2 August, midnight_.--Woke up from few minutes’ sleep by hearing a cry,seemingly outside my port. Could see nothing in fog. Rushed on deck, andran against mate. Tells me heard cry and ran, but no sign of man onwatch. One more gone. Lord, help us! Mate says we must be past Straitsof Dover, as in a moment of fog lifting he saw North Foreland, just ashe heard the man cry out. If so we are now off in the North Sea, andonly God can guide us in the fog, which seems to move with us; and Godseems to have deserted us.*       *       *       *       *_3 August_.--At midnight I went to relieve the man at the wheel, andwhen I got to it found no one there. The wind was steady, and as we ranbefore it there was no yawing. I dared not leave it, so shouted for themate. After a few seconds he rushed up on deck in his flannels. Helooked wild-eyed and haggard, and I greatly fear his reason has givenway. He came close to me and whispered hoarsely, with his mouth to myear, as though fearing the very air might hear: “_It_ is here; I knowit, now. On the watch last night I saw It, like a man, tall and thin,and ghastly pale. It was in the bows, and looking out. I crept behindIt, and gave It my knife; but the knife went through It, empty as theair.” And as he spoke he took his knife and drove it savagely intospace. Then he went on: “But It is here, and I’ll find It. It is in thehold, perhaps in one of those boxes. I’ll unscrew them one by one andsee. You work the helm.” And, with a warning look and his finger on hislip, he went below. There was springing up a choppy wind, and I couldnot leave the helm. I saw him come out on deck again with a tool-chestand a lantern, and go down the forward hatchway. He is mad, stark,raving mad, and it’s no use my trying to stop him. He can’t hurt thosebig boxes: they are invoiced as “clay,” and to pull them about is asharmless a thing as he can do. So here I stay, and mind the helm, andwrite these notes. I can only trust in God and wait till the fog clears.Then, if I can’t steer to any harbour with the wind that is, I shall cutdown sails and lie by, and signal for help....*       *       *       *       *It is nearly all over now. Just as I was beginning to hope that the matewould come out calmer--for I heard him knocking away at something in thehold, and work is good for him--there came up the hatchway a sudden,startled scream, which made my blood run cold, and up on the deck hecame as if shot from a gun--a raging madman, with his eyes rolling andhis face convulsed with fear. “Save me! save me!” he cried, and thenlooked round on the blanket of fog. His horror turned to despair, and ina steady voice he said: “You had better come too, captain, before it istoo late. _He_ is there. I know the secret now. The sea will save mefrom Him, and it is all that is left!” Before I could say a word, ormove forward to seize him, he sprang on the bulwark and deliberatelythrew himself into the sea. I suppose I know the secret too, now. It wasthis madman who had got rid of the men one by one, and now he hasfollowed them himself. God help me! How am I to account for all thesehorrors when I get to port? _When_ I get to port! Will that ever be?*       *       *       *       *_4 August._--Still fog, which the sunrise cannot pierce. I know there issunrise because I am a sailor, why else I know not. I dared not gobelow, I dared not leave the helm; so here all night I stayed, and inthe dimness of the night I saw It--Him! God forgive me, but the mate wasright to jump overboard. It was better to die like a man; to die like asailor in blue water no man can object. But I am captain, and I must notleave my ship. But I shall baffle this fiend or monster, for I shall tiemy hands to the wheel when my strength begins to fail, and along withthem I shall tie that which He--It!--dare not touch; and then, come goodwind or foul, I shall save my soul, and my honour as a captain. I amgrowing weaker, and the night is coming on. If He can look me in theface again, I may not have time to act.... If we are wrecked, mayhapthis bottle may be found, and those who find it may understand; if not,... well, then all men shall know that I have been true to my trust. Godand the Blessed Virgin and the saints help a poor ignorant soul tryingto do his duty....*       *       *       *       *Of course the verdict was an open one. There is no evidence to adduce;and whether or not the man himself committed the murders there is nownone to say. The folk here hold almost universally that the captain issimply a hero, and he is to be given a public funeral. Already it isarranged that his body is to be taken with a train of boats up the Eskfor a piece and then brought back to Tate Hill Pier and up the abbeysteps; for he is to be buried in the churchyard on the cliff. The ownersof more than a hundred boats have already given in their names aswishing to follow him to the grave.No trace has ever been found of the great dog; at which there is muchmourning, for, with public opinion in its present state, he would, Ibelieve, be adopted by the town. To-morrow will see the funeral; and sowill end this one more “mystery of the sea.”_Mina Murray’s Journal.__8 August._--Lucy was very restless all night, and I, too, could notsleep. The storm was fearful, and as it boomed loudly among thechimney-pots, it made me shudder. When a sharp puff came it seemed to belike a distant gun. Strangely enough, Lucy did not wake; but she got uptwice and dressed herself. Fortunately, each time I awoke in time andmanaged to undress her without waking her, and got her back to bed. Itis a very strange thing, this sleep-walking, for as soon as her will isthwarted in any physical way, her intention, if there be any,disappears, and she yields herself almost exactly to the routine of herlife.Early in the morning we both got up and went down to the harbour to seeif anything had happened in the night. There were very few people about,and though the sun was bright, and the air clear and fresh, the big,grim-looking waves, that seemed dark themselves because the foam thattopped them was like snow, forced themselves in through the narrow mouthof the harbour--like a bullying man going through a crowd. Somehow Ifelt glad that Jonathan was not on the sea last night, but on land. But,oh, is he on land or sea? Where is he, and how? I am getting fearfullyanxious about him. If I only knew what to do, and could do anything!*       *       *       *       *_10 August._--The funeral of the poor sea-captain to-day was mosttouching. Every boat in the harbour seemed to be there, and the coffinwas carried by captains all the way from Tate Hill Pier up to thechurchyard. Lucy came with me, and we went early to our old seat, whilstthe cortège of boats went up the river to the Viaduct and came downagain. We had a lovely view, and saw the procession nearly all the way.The poor fellow was laid to rest quite near our seat so that we stood onit when the time came and saw everything. Poor Lucy seemed much upset.She was restless and uneasy all the time, and I cannot but think thather dreaming at night is telling on her. She is quite odd in one thing:she will not admit to me that there is any cause for restlessness; or ifthere be, she does not understand it herself. There is an additionalcause in that poor old Mr. Swales was found dead this morning on ourseat, his neck being broken. He had evidently, as the doctor said,fallen back in the seat in some sort of fright, for there was a look offear and horror on his face that the men said made them shudder. Poordear old man! Perhaps he had seen Death with his dying eyes! Lucy is sosweet and sensitive that she feels influences more acutely than otherpeople do. Just now she was quite upset by a little thing which I didnot much heed, though I am myself very fond of animals. One of the menwho came up here often to look for the boats was followed by his dog.The dog is always with him. They are both quiet persons, and I never sawthe man angry, nor heard the dog bark. During the service the dog wouldnot come to its master, who was on the seat with us, but kept a fewyards off, barking and howling. Its master spoke to it gently, and thenharshly, and then angrily; but it would neither come nor cease to make anoise. It was in a sort of fury, with its eyes savage, and all its hairsbristling out like a cat’s tail when puss is on the war-path. Finallythe man, too, got angry, and jumped down and kicked the dog, and thentook it by the scruff of the neck and half dragged and half threw it onthe tombstone on which the seat is fixed. The moment it touched thestone the poor thing became quiet and fell all into a tremble. It didnot try to get away, but crouched down, quivering and cowering, and wasin such a pitiable state of terror that I tried, though without effect,to comfort it. Lucy was full of pity, too, but she did not attempt totouch the dog, but looked at it in an agonised sort of way. I greatlyfear that she is of too super-sensitive a nature to go through the worldwithout trouble. She will be dreaming of this to-night, I am sure. Thewhole agglomeration of things--the ship steered into port by a deadman; his attitude, tied to the wheel with a crucifix and beads; thetouching funeral; the dog, now furious and now in terror--will allafford material for her dreams.I think it will be best for her to go to bed tired out physically, so Ishall take her for a long walk by the cliffs to Robin Hood’s Bay andback. She ought not to have much inclination for sleep-walking then.CHAPTER VIIIMINA MURRAY’S JOURNAL_Same day, 11 o’clock p. m._--Oh, but I am tired! If it were not that Ihad made my diary a duty I should not open it to-night. We had a lovelywalk. Lucy, after a while, was in gay spirits, owing, I think, to somedear cows who came nosing towards us in a field close to the lighthouse,and frightened the wits out of us. I believe we forgot everythingexcept, of course, personal fear, and it seemed to wipe the slate cleanand give us a fresh start. We had a capital “severe tea” at Robin Hood’sBay in a sweet little old-fashioned inn, with a bow-window right overthe seaweed-covered rocks of the strand. I believe we should haveshocked the “New Woman” with our appetites. Men are more tolerant, blessthem! Then we walked home with some, or rather many, stoppages to rest,and with our hearts full of a constant dread of wild bulls. Lucy wasreally tired, and we intended to creep off to bed as soon as we could.The young curate came in, however, and Mrs. Westenra asked him to stayfor supper. Lucy and I had both a fight for it with the dusty miller; Iknow it was a hard fight on my part, and I am quite heroic. I think thatsome day the bishops must get together and see about breeding up a newclass of curates, who don’t take supper, no matter how they may bepressed to, and who will know when girls are tired. Lucy is asleep andbreathing softly. She has more colour in her cheeks than usual, andlooks, oh, so sweet. If Mr. Holmwood fell in love with her seeing heronly in the drawing-room, I wonder what he would say if he saw her now.Some of the “New Women” writers will some day start an idea that men andwomen should be allowed to see each other asleep before proposing oraccepting. But I suppose the New Woman won’t condescend in future toaccept; she will do the proposing herself. And a nice job she will makeof it, too! There’s some consolation in that. I am so happy to-night,because dear Lucy seems better. I really believe she has turned thecorner, and that we are over her troubles with dreaming. I should bequite happy if I only knew if Jonathan.... God bless and keep him.*       *       *       *       *_11 August, 3 a. m._--Diary again. No sleep now, so I may as well write.I am too agitated to sleep. We have had such an adventure, such anagonising experience. I fell asleep as soon as I had closed my diary....Suddenly I became broad awake, and sat up, with a horrible sense of fearupon me, and of some feeling of emptiness around me. The room was dark,so I could not see Lucy’s bed; I stole across and felt for her. The bedwas empty. I lit a match and found that she was not in the room. Thedoor was shut, but not locked, as I had left it. I feared to wake hermother, who has been more than usually ill lately, so threw on someclothes and got ready to look for her. As I was leaving the room itstruck me that the clothes she wore might give me some clue to herdreaming intention. Dressing-gown would mean house; dress, outside.Dressing-gown and dress were both in their places. “Thank God,” I saidto myself, “she cannot be far, as she is only in her nightdress.” I randownstairs and looked in the sitting-room. Not there! Then I looked inall the other open rooms of the house, with an ever-growing fearchilling my heart. Finally I came to the hall door and found it open. Itwas not wide open, but the catch of the lock had not caught. The peopleof the house are careful to lock the door every night, so I feared thatLucy must have gone out as she was. There was no time to think of whatmight happen; a vague, overmastering fear obscured all details. I took abig, heavy shawl and ran out. The clock was striking one as I was in theCrescent, and there was not a soul in sight. I ran along the NorthTerrace, but could see no sign of the white figure which I expected. Atthe edge of the West Cliff above the pier I looked across the harbour tothe East Cliff, in the hope or fear--I don’t know which--of seeing Lucyin our favourite seat. There was a bright full moon, with heavy black,driving clouds, which threw the whole scene into a fleeting diorama oflight and shade as they sailed across. For a moment or two I could seenothing, as the shadow of a cloud obscured St. Mary’s Church and allaround it. Then as the cloud passed I could see the ruins of the abbeycoming into view; and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp asa sword-cut moved along, the church and the churchyard became graduallyvisible. Whatever my expectation was, it was not disappointed, forthere, on our favourite seat, the silver light of the moon struck ahalf-reclining figure, snowy white. The coming of the cloud was tooquick for me to see much, for shadow shut down on light almostimmediately; but it seemed to me as though something dark stood behindthe seat where the white figure shone, and bent over it. What it was,whether man or beast, I could not tell; I did not wait to catch anotherglance, but flew down the steep steps to the pier and along by thefish-market to the bridge, which was the only way to reach the EastCliff. The town seemed as dead, for not a soul did I see; I rejoicedthat it was so, for I wanted no witness of poor Lucy’s condition. Thetime and distance seemed endless, and my knees trembled and my breathcame laboured as I toiled up the endless steps to the abbey. I must havegone fast, and yet it seemed to me as if my feet were weighted withlead, and as though every joint in my body were rusty. When I got almostto the top I could see the seat and the white figure, for I was nowclose enough to distinguish it even through the spells of shadow. Therewas undoubtedly something, long and black, bending over thehalf-reclining white figure. I called in fright, “Lucy! Lucy!” andsomething raised a head, and from where I was I could see a white faceand red, gleaming eyes. Lucy did not answer, and I ran on to theentrance of the churchyard. As I entered, the church was between me andthe seat, and for a minute or so I lost sight of her. When I came inview again the cloud had passed, and the moonlight struck so brilliantlythat I could see Lucy half reclining with her head lying over the backof the seat. She was quite alone, and there was not a sign of any livingthing about.When I bent over her I could see that she was still asleep. Her lipswere parted, and she was breathing--not softly as usual with her, but inlong, heavy gasps, as though striving to get her lungs full at everybreath. As I came close, she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled thecollar of her nightdress close around her throat. Whilst she did sothere came a little shudder through her, as though she felt the cold. Iflung the warm shawl over her, and drew the edges tight round her neck,for I dreaded lest she should get some deadly chill from the night air,unclad as she was. I feared to wake her all at once, so, in order tohave my hands free that I might help her, I fastened the shawl at herthroat with a big safety-pin; but I must have been clumsy in my anxietyand pinched or pricked her with it, for by-and-by, when her breathingbecame quieter, she put her hand to her throat again and moaned. When Ihad her carefully wrapped up I put my shoes on her feet and then beganvery gently to wake her. At first she did not respond; but gradually shebecame more and more uneasy in her sleep, moaning and sighingoccasionally. At last, as time was passing fast, and, for many otherreasons, I wished to get her home at once, I shook her more forcibly,till finally she opened her eyes and awoke. She did not seem surprisedto see me, as, of course, she did not realise all at once where she was.Lucy always wakes prettily, and even at such a time, when her body musthave been chilled with cold, and her mind somewhat appalled at wakingunclad in a churchyard at night, she did not lose her grace. Shetrembled a little, and clung to me; when I told her to come at once withme home she rose without a word, with the obedience of a child. As wepassed along, the gravel hurt my feet, and Lucy noticed me wince. Shestopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes; but I would not.However, when we got to the pathway outside the churchyard, where therewas a puddle of water, remaining from the storm, I daubed my feet withmud, using each foot in turn on the other, so that as we went home, noone, in case we should meet any one, should notice my bare feet.Fortune favoured us, and we got home without meeting a soul. Once we sawa man, who seemed not quite sober, passing along a street in front ofus; but we hid in a door till he had disappeared up an opening such asthere are here, steep little closes, or “wynds,” as they call them inScotland. My heart beat so loud all the time that sometimes I thought Ishould faint. I was filled with anxiety about Lucy, not only for herhealth, lest she should suffer from the exposure, but for her reputationin case the story should get wind. When we got in, and had washed ourfeet, and had said a prayer of thankfulness together, I tucked her intobed. Before falling asleep she asked--even implored--me not to say aword to any one, even her mother, about her sleep-walking adventure. Ihesitated at first to promise; but on thinking of the state of hermother’s health, and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret her,and thinking, too, of how such a story might become distorted--nay,infallibly would--in case it should leak out, I thought it wiser to doso. I hope I did right. I have locked the door, and the key is tied tomy wrist, so perhaps I shall not be again disturbed. Lucy is sleepingsoundly; the reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea....*       *       *       *       *_Same day, noon._--All goes well. Lucy slept till I woke her and seemednot to have even changed her side. The adventure of the night does notseem to have harmed her; on the contrary, it has benefited her, for shelooks better this morning than she has done for weeks. I was sorry tonotice that my clumsiness with the safety-pin hurt her. Indeed, it mighthave been serious, for the skin of her throat was pierced. I must havepinched up a piece of loose skin and have transfixed it, for there aretwo little red points like pin-pricks, and on the band of her nightdresswas a drop of blood. When I apologised and was concerned about it, shelaughed and petted me, and said she did not even feel it. Fortunately itcannot leave a scar, as it is so tiny.*       *       *       *       *_Same day, night._--We passed a happy day. The air was clear, and thesun bright, and there was a cool breeze. We took our lunch to MulgraveWoods, Mrs. Westenra driving by the road and Lucy and I walking by thecliff-path and joining her at the gate. I felt a little sad myself, forI could not but feel how _absolutely_ happy it would have been hadJonathan been with me. But there! I must only be patient. In the eveningwe strolled in the Casino Terrace, and heard some good music by Spohrand Mackenzie, and went to bed early. Lucy seems more restful than shehas been for some time, and fell asleep at once. I shall lock the doorand secure the key the same as before, though I do not expect anytrouble to-night.*       *       *       *       *_12 August._--My expectations were wrong, for twice during the night Iwas wakened by Lucy trying to get out. She seemed, even in her sleep, tobe a little impatient at finding the door shut, and went back to bedunder a sort of protest. I woke with the dawn, and heard the birdschirping outside of the window. Lucy woke, too, and, I was glad to see,was even better than on the previous morning. All her old gaiety ofmanner seemed to have come back, and she came and snuggled in beside meand told me all about Arthur. I told her how anxious I was aboutJonathan, and then she tried to comfort me. Well, she succeededsomewhat, for, though sympathy can’t alter facts, it can help to makethem more bearable.*       *       *       *       *_13 August._--Another quiet day, and to bed with the key on my wrist asbefore. Again I awoke in the night, and found Lucy sitting up in bed,still asleep, pointing to the window. I got up quietly, and pullingaside the blind, looked out. It was brilliant moonlight, and the softeffect of the light over the sea and sky--merged together in one great,silent mystery--was beautiful beyond words. Between me and the moonlightflitted a great bat, coming and going in great whirling circles. Once ortwice it came quite close, but was, I suppose, frightened at seeing me,and flitted away across the harbour towards the abbey. When I came backfrom the window Lucy had lain down again, and was sleeping peacefully.She did not stir again all night.*       *       *       *       *_14 August._--On the East Cliff, reading and writing all day. Lucy seemsto have become as much in love with the spot as I am, and it is hard toget her away from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea ordinner. This afternoon she made a funny remark. We were coming home fordinner, and had come to the top of the steps up from the West Pier andstopped to look at the view, as we generally do. The setting sun, lowdown in the sky, was just dropping behind Kettleness; the red light wasthrown over on the East Cliff and the old abbey, and seemed to batheeverything in a beautiful rosy glow. We were silent for a while, andsuddenly Lucy murmured as if to herself:--“His red eyes again! They are just the same.” It was such an oddexpression, coming _apropos_ of nothing, that it quite startled me. Islewed round a little, so as to see Lucy well without seeming to stareat her, and saw that she was in a half-dreamy state, with an odd look onher face that I could not quite make out; so I said nothing, butfollowed her eyes. She appeared to be looking over at our own seat,whereon was a dark figure seated alone. I was a little startled myself,for it seemed for an instant as if the stranger had great eyes likeburning flames; but a second look dispelled the illusion. The redsunlight was shining on the windows of St. Mary’s Church behind ourseat, and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in therefraction and reflection to make it appear as if the light moved. Icalled Lucy’s attention to the peculiar effect, and she became herselfwith a start, but she looked sad all the same; it may have been that shewas thinking of that terrible night up there. We never refer to it; so Isaid nothing, and we went home to dinner. Lucy had a headache and wentearly to bed. I saw her asleep, and went out for a little stroll myself;I walked along the cliffs to the westward, and was full of sweetsadness, for I was thinking of Jonathan. When coming home--it was thenbright moonlight, so bright that, though the front of our part of theCrescent was in shadow, everything could be well seen--I threw a glanceup at our window, and saw Lucy’s head leaning out. I thought thatperhaps she was looking out for me, so I opened my handkerchief andwaved it. She did not notice or make any movement whatever. Just then,the moonlight crept round an angle of the building, and the light fellon the window. There distinctly was Lucy with her head lying up againstthe side of the window-sill and her eyes shut. She was fast asleep, andby her, seated on the window-sill, was something that looked like agood-sized bird. I was afraid she might get a chill, so I ran upstairs,but as I came into the room she was moving back to her bed, fastasleep, and breathing heavily; she was holding her hand to her throat,as though to protect it from cold.I did not wake her, but tucked her up warmly; I have taken care that thedoor is locked and the window securely fastened.She looks so sweet as she sleeps; but she is paler than is her wont, andthere is a drawn, haggard look under her eyes which I do not like. Ifear she is fretting about something. I wish I could find out what itis.*       *       *       *       *_15 August._--Rose later than usual. Lucy was languid and tired, andslept on after we had been called. We had a happy surprise at breakfast.Arthur’s father is better, and wants the marriage to come off soon. Lucyis full of quiet joy, and her mother is glad and sorry at once. Later onin the day she told me the cause. She is grieved to lose Lucy as hervery own, but she is rejoiced that she is soon to have some one toprotect her. Poor dear, sweet lady! She confided to me that she has gother death-warrant. She has not told Lucy, and made me promise secrecy;her doctor told her that within a few months, at most, she must die, forher heart is weakening. At any time, even now, a sudden shock would bealmost sure to kill her. Ah, we were wise to keep from her the affair ofthe dreadful night of Lucy’s sleep-walking.*       *       *       *       *_17 August._--No diary for two whole days. I have not had the heart towrite. Some sort of shadowy pall seems to be coming over our happiness.No news from Jonathan, and Lucy seems to be growing weaker, whilst hermother’s hours are numbering to a close. I do not understand Lucy’sfading away as she is doing. She eats well and sleeps well, and enjoysthe fresh air; but all the time the roses in her cheeks are fading, andshe gets weaker and more languid day by day; at night I hear her gaspingas if for air. I keep the key of our door always fastened to my wrist atnight, but she gets up and walks about the room, and sits at the openwindow. Last night I found her leaning out when I woke up, and when Itried to wake her I could not; she was in a faint. When I managed torestore her she was as weak as water, and cried silently between long,painful struggles for breath. When I asked her how she came to be at thewindow she shook her head and turned away. I trust her feeling ill maynot be from that unlucky prick of the safety-pin. I looked at her throatjust now as she lay asleep, and the tiny wounds seem not to have healed.They are still open, and, if anything, larger than before, and theedges of them are faintly white. They are like little white dots withred centres. Unless they heal within a day or two, I shall insist on thedoctor seeing about them._Letter, Samuel F.

Lucy is ever so much better. Last night she slept well allnight, and did not disturb me once. The roses seem coming back alreadyto her cheeks, though she is still sadly pale and wan-looking. If shewere in any way anæmic I could understand it, but she is not. She is ingay spirits and full of life and cheerfulness. All the morbid reticenceseems to have passed from her, and she has just reminded me, as if Ineeded any reminding, of _that_ night, and that it was here, on thisvery seat, I found her asleep. As she told me she tapped playfully withthe heel of her boot on the stone slab and said:--“My poor little feet didn’t make much noise then! I daresay poor old Mr.Swales would have told me that it was because I didn’t want to wake upGeordie.” As she was in such a communicative humour, I asked her if shehad dreamed at all that night. Before she answered, that sweet, puckeredlook came into her forehead, which Arthur--I call him Arthur from herhabit--says he loves; and, indeed, I don’t wonder that he does. Then shewent on in a half-dreaming kind of way, as if trying to recall it toherself:--“I didn’t quite dream; but it all seemed to be real. I only wanted to behere in this spot--I don’t know why, for I was afraid of something--Idon’t know what. I remember, though I suppose I was asleep, passingthrough the streets and over the bridge. A fish leaped as I went by, andI leaned over to look at it, and I heard a lot of dogs howling--thewhole town seemed as if it must be full of dogs all howling at once--asI went up the steps. Then I had a vague memory of something long anddark with red eyes, just as we saw in the sunset, and something verysweet and very bitter all around me at once; and then I seemed sinkinginto deep green water, and there was a singing in my ears, as I haveheard there is to drowning men; and then everything seemed passing awayfrom me; my soul seemed to go out from my body and float about the air.I seem to remember that once the West Lighthouse was right under me,and then there was a sort of agonising feeling, as if I were in anearthquake, and I came back and found you shaking my body. I saw you doit before I felt you.”Then she began to laugh. It seemed a little uncanny to me, and Ilistened to her breathlessly. I did not quite like it, and thought itbetter not to keep her mind on the subject, so we drifted on to othersubjects, and Lucy was like her old self again. When we got home thefresh breeze had braced her up, and her pale cheeks were really morerosy. Her mother rejoiced when she saw her, and we all spent a veryhappy evening together.*       *       *       *       *_19 August._--Joy, joy, joy! although not all joy. At last, news ofJonathan. The dear fellow has been ill; that is why he did not write. Iam not afraid to think it or say it, now that I know. Mr. Hawkins sentme on the letter, and wrote himself, oh, so kindly. I am to leave in themorning and go over to Jonathan, and to help to nurse him if necessary,and to bring him home. Mr. Hawkins says it would not be a bad thing ifwe were to be married out there. I have cried over the good Sister’sletter till I can feel it wet against my bosom, where it lies. It is ofJonathan, and must be next my heart, for he is _in_ my heart. My journeyis all mapped out, and my luggage ready. I am only taking one change ofdress; Lucy will bring my trunk to London and keep it till I send forit, for it may be that ... I must write no more; I must keep it to sayto Jonathan, my husband. The letter that he has seen and touched mustcomfort me till we meet._Letter, Sister Agatha, Hospital of St. Joseph and Ste. Mary,Buda-Pesth, to Miss Wilhelmina Murray._“_12 August._“Dear Madam,--“I write by desire of Mr. Jonathan Harker, who is himself not strongenough to write, though progressing well, thanks to God and St. Josephand Ste. Mary. He has been under our care for nearly six weeks,suffering from a violent brain fever. He wishes me to convey his love,and to say that by this post I write for him to Mr. Peter Hawkins,Exeter, to say, with his dutiful respects, that he is sorry for hisdelay, and that all of his work is completed. He will require some fewweeks’ rest in our sanatorium in the hills, but will then return. Hewishes me to say that he has not sufficient money with him, and that hewould like to pay for his staying here, so that others who need shallnot be wanting for help.“Believe me,“Yours, with sympathy and all blessings,“SISTER AGATHA.“P. S.--My patient being asleep, I open this to let you know somethingmore. He has told me all about you, and that you are shortly to be hiswife. All blessings to you both! He has had some fearful shock--so saysour doctor--and in his delirium his ravings have been dreadful; ofwolves and poison and blood; of ghosts and demons; and I fear to say ofwhat. Be careful with him always that there may be nothing to excite himof this kind for a long time to come; the traces of such an illness ashis do not lightly die away. We should have written long ago, but weknew nothing of his friends, and there was on him nothing that any onecould understand. He came in the train from Klausenburg, and the guardwas told by the station-master there that he rushed into the stationshouting for a ticket for home. Seeing from his violent demeanour thathe was English, they gave him a ticket for the furthest station on theway thither that the train reached.“Be assured that he is well cared for. He has won all hearts by hissweetness and gentleness. He is truly getting on well, and I have nodoubt will in a few weeks be all himself. But be careful of him forsafety’s sake. There are, I pray God and St. Joseph and Ste. Mary, many,many, happy years for you both.”_Dr. Seward’s Diary.__19 August._--Strange and sudden change in Renfield last night. Abouteight o’clock he began to get excited and sniff about as a dog does whensetting. The attendant was struck by his manner, and knowing my interestin him, encouraged him to talk. He is usually respectful to theattendant and at times servile; but to-night, the man tells me, he wasquite haughty. Would not condescend to talk with him at all. All hewould say was:--“I don’t want to talk to you: you don’t count now; the Master is athand.”The attendant thinks it is some sudden form of religious mania which hasseized him. If so, we must look out for squalls, for a strong man withhomicidal and religious mania at once might be dangerous. Thecombination is a dreadful one. At nine o’clock I visited him myself. Hisattitude to me was the same as that to the attendant; in his sublimeself-feeling the difference between myself and attendant seemed to himas nothing. It looks like religious mania, and he will soon think thathe himself is God. These infinitesimal distinctions between man and manare too paltry for an Omnipotent Being. How these madmen give themselvesaway! The real God taketh heed lest a sparrow fall; but the God createdfrom human vanity sees no difference between an eagle and a sparrow. Oh,if men only knew!For half an hour or more Renfield kept getting excited in greater andgreater degree. I did not pretend to be watching him, but I kept strictobservation all the same. All at once that shifty look came into hiseyes which we always see when a madman has seized an idea, and with itthe shifty movement of the head and back which asylum attendants come toknow so well. He became quite quiet, and went and sat on the edge of hisbed resignedly, and looked into space with lack-lustre eyes. I thought Iwould find out if his apathy were real or only assumed, and tried tolead him to talk of his pets, a theme which had never failed to excitehis attention. At first he made no reply, but at length said testily:--“Bother them all! I don’t care a pin about them.”“What?” I said. “You don’t mean to tell me you don’t care aboutspiders?” (Spiders at present are his hobby and the note-book is fillingup with columns of small figures.) To this he answered enigmatically:--“The bride-maidens rejoice the eyes that wait the coming of the bride;but when the bride draweth nigh, then the maidens shine not to the eyesthat are filled.”He would not explain himself, but remained obstinately seated on his bedall the time I remained with him.I am weary to-night and low in spirits. I cannot but think of Lucy, andhow different things might have been. If I don’t sleep at once, chloral,the modern Morpheus--C_{2}HCl_{3}O. H_{2}O! I must be careful not to letit grow into a habit. No, I shall take none to-night! I have thought ofLucy, and I shall not dishonour her by mixing the two. If need be,to-night shall be sleepless....*       *       *       *       *_Later._--Glad I made the resolution; gladder that I kept to it. I hadlain tossing about, and had heard the clock strike only twice, when thenight-watchman came to me, sent up from the ward, to say that Renfieldhad escaped. I threw on my clothes and ran down at once; my patient istoo dangerous a person to be roaming about. Those ideas of his mightwork out dangerously with strangers. The attendant was waiting for me.He said he had seen him not ten minutes before, seemingly asleep in hisbed, when he had looked through the observation-trap in the door. Hisattention was called by the sound of the window being wrenched out. Heran back and saw his feet disappear through the window, and had at oncesent up for me. He was only in his night-gear, and cannot be far off.The attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where he shouldgo than to follow him, as he might lose sight of him whilst getting outof the building by the door. He is a bulky man, and couldn’t get throughthe window. I am thin, so, with his aid, I got out, but feet foremost,and, as we were only a few feet above ground, landed unhurt. Theattendant told me the patient had gone to the left, and had taken astraight line, so I ran as quickly as I could. As I got through the beltof trees I saw a white figure scale the high wall which separates ourgrounds from those of the deserted house.I ran back at once, told the watchman to get three or four menimmediately and follow me into the grounds of Carfax, in case our friendmight be dangerous. I got a ladder myself, and crossing the wall,dropped down on the other side. I could see Renfield’s figure justdisappearing behind the angle of the house, so I ran after him. On thefar side of the house I found him pressed close against the oldironbound oak door of the chapel. He was talking, apparently to someone, but I was afraid to go near enough to hear what he was saying, lestI might frighten him, and he should run off. Chasing an errant swarm ofbees is nothing to following a naked lunatic, when the fit of escapingis upon him! After a few minutes, however, I could see that he did nottake note of anything around him, and so ventured to draw nearer tohim--the more so as my men had now crossed the wall and were closing himin. I heard him say:--“I am here to do Your bidding, Master. I am Your slave, and You willreward me, for I shall be faithful. I have worshipped You long and afaroff. Now that You are near, I await Your commands, and You will not passme by, will You, dear Master, in Your distribution of good things?”He _is_ a selfish old beggar anyhow. He thinks of the loaves and fisheseven when he believes he is in a Real Presence. His manias make astartling combination. When we closed in on him he fought like a tiger.He is immensely strong, for he was more like a wild beast than a man. Inever saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage before; and I hope Ishall not again. It is a mercy that we have found out his strength andhis danger in good time. With strength and determination like his, hemight have done wild work before he was caged. He is safe now at anyrate. Jack Sheppard himself couldn’t get free from the strait-waistcoatthat keeps him restrained, and he’s chained to the wall in the paddedroom. His cries are at times awful, but the silences that follow aremore deadly still, for he means murder in every turn and movement.Just now he spoke coherent words for the first time:--“I shall be patient, Master. It is coming--coming--coming!”So I took the hint, and came too. I was too excited to sleep, but thisdiary has quieted me, and I feel I shall get some sleep to-night.CHAPTER IX_Letter, Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra._“_Buda-Pesth, 24 August._“My dearest Lucy,--“I know you will be anxious to hear all that has happened since weparted at the railway station at Whitby. Well, my dear, I got to Hullall right, and caught the boat to Hamburg, and then the train on here. Ifeel that I can hardly recall anything of the journey, except that Iknew I was coming to Jonathan, and, that as I should have to do somenursing, I had better get all the sleep I could.... I found my dear one,oh, so thin and pale and weak-looking. All the resolution has gone outof his dear eyes, and that quiet dignity which I told you was in hisface has vanished. He is only a wreck of himself, and he does notremember anything that has happened to him for a long time past. Atleast, he wants me to believe so, and I shall never ask. He has had someterrible shock, and I fear it might tax his poor brain if he were to tryto recall it. Sister Agatha, who is a good creature and a born nurse,tells me that he raved of dreadful things whilst he was off his head. Iwanted her to tell me what they were; but she would only cross herself,and say she would never tell; that the ravings of the sick were thesecrets of God, and that if a nurse through her vocation should hearthem, she should respect her trust. She is a sweet, good soul, and thenext day, when she saw I was troubled, she opened up the subject again,and after saying that she could never mention what my poor dear ravedabout, added: ‘I can tell you this much, my dear: that it was not aboutanything which he has done wrong himself; and you, as his wife to be,have no cause to be concerned. He has not forgotten you or what he owesto you. His fear was of great and terrible things, which no mortal cantreat of.’ I do believe the dear soul thought I might be jealous lest mypoor dear should have fallen in love with any other girl. The idea of_my_ being jealous about Jonathan! And yet, my dear, let me whisper, Ifelt a thrill of joy through me when I _knew_ that no other woman was acause of trouble. I am now sitting by his bedside, where I can see hisface while he sleeps. He is waking!...“When he woke he asked me for his coat, as he wanted to get somethingfrom the pocket; I asked Sister Agatha, and she brought all his things.I saw that amongst them was his note-book, and was going to ask him tolet me look at it--for I knew then that I might find some clue to histrouble--but I suppose he must have seen my wish in my eyes, for he sentme over to the window, saying he wanted to be quite alone for a moment.Then he called me back, and when I came he had his hand over thenote-book, and he said to me very solemnly:--“‘Wilhelmina’--I knew then that he was in deadly earnest, for he hasnever called me by that name since he asked me to marry him--‘you know,dear, my ideas of the trust between husband and wife: there should be nosecret, no concealment. I have had a great shock, and when I try tothink of what it is I feel my head spin round, and I do not know if itwas all real or the dreaming of a madman. You know I have had brainfever, and that is to be mad. The secret is here, and I do not want toknow it. I want to take up my life here, with our marriage.’ For, mydear, we had decided to be married as soon as the formalities arecomplete. ‘Are you willing, Wilhelmina, to share my ignorance? Here isthe book. Take it and keep it, read it if you will, but never let meknow; unless, indeed, some solemn duty should come upon me to go back tothe bitter hours, asleep or awake, sane or mad, recorded here.’ He fellback exhausted, and I put the book under his pillow, and kissed him. Ihave asked Sister Agatha to beg the Superior to let our wedding be thisafternoon, and am waiting her reply....*       *       *       *       *“She has come and told me that the chaplain of the English missionchurch has been sent for. We are to be married in an hour, or as soonafter as Jonathan awakes....*       *       *       *       *“Lucy, the time has come and gone. I feel very solemn, but very, veryhappy. Jonathan woke a little after the hour, and all was ready, and hesat up in bed, propped up with pillows. He answered his ‘I will’ firmlyand strongly. I could hardly speak; my heart was so full that even thosewords seemed to choke me. The dear sisters were so kind. Please God, Ishall never, never forget them, nor the grave and sweet responsibilitiesI have taken upon me. I must tell you of my wedding present. When thechaplain and the sisters had left me alone with my husband--oh, Lucy, itis the first time I have written the words ‘my husband’--left me alonewith my husband, I took the book from under his pillow, and wrapped itup in white paper, and tied it with a little bit of pale blue ribbonwhich was round my neck, and sealed it over the knot with sealing-wax,and for my seal I used my wedding ring. Then I kissed it and showed itto my husband, and told him that I would keep it so, and then it wouldbe an outward and visible sign for us all our lives that we trusted eachother; that I would never open it unless it were for his own dear sakeor for the sake of some stern duty. Then he took my hand in his, and oh,Lucy, it was the first time he took _his wife’s_ hand, and said that itwas the dearest thing in all the wide world, and that he would gothrough all the past again to win it, if need be. The poor dear meant tohave said a part of the past, but he cannot think of time yet, and Ishall not wonder if at first he mixes up not only the month, but theyear.“Well, my dear, what could I say? I could only tell him that I was thehappiest woman in all the wide world, and that I had nothing to give himexcept myself, my life, and my trust, and that with these went my loveand duty for all the days of my life. And, my dear, when he kissed me,and drew me to him with his poor weak hands, it was like a very solemnpledge between us....“Lucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this? It is not only becauseit is all sweet to me, but because you have been, and are, very dear tome. It was my privilege to be your friend and guide when you came fromthe schoolroom to prepare for the world of life. I want you to see now,and with the eyes of a very happy wife, whither duty has led me; so thatin your own married life you too may be all happy as I am. My dear,please Almighty God, your life may be all it promises: a long day ofsunshine, with no harsh wind, no forgetting duty, no distrust. I mustnot wish you no pain, for that can never be; but I do hope you will be_always_ as happy as I am _now_. Good-bye, my dear. I shall post this atonce, and, perhaps, write you very soon again. I must stop, for Jonathanis waking--I must attend to my husband!“Your ever-loving“MINA HARKER.”_Letter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Harker._“_Whitby, 30 August._“My dearest Mina,--“Oceans of love and millions of kisses, and may you soon be in your ownhome with your husband. I wish you could be coming home soon enough tostay with us here. The strong air would soon restore Jonathan; it hasquite restored me. I have an appetite like a cormorant, am full oflife, and sleep well. You will be glad to know that I have quite givenup walking in my sleep. I think I have not stirred out of my bed for aweek, that is when I once got into it at night. Arthur says I am gettingfat. By the way, I forgot to tell you that Arthur is here. We have suchwalks and drives, and rides, and rowing, and tennis, and fishingtogether; and I love him more than ever. He _tells_ me that he loves memore, but I doubt that, for at first he told me that he couldn’t love memore than he did then. But this is nonsense. There he is, calling to me.So no more just at present from your loving“LUCY.“P. S.--Mother sends her love. She seems better, poor dear.“P. P. S.--We are to be married on 28 September.”_Dr. Seward’s Diary.__20 August._--The case of Renfield grows even more interesting. He hasnow so far quieted that there are spells of cessation from his passion.For the first week after his attack he was perpetually violent. Then onenight, just as the moon rose, he grew quiet, and kept murmuring tohimself: “Now I can wait; now I can wait.” The attendant came to tellme, so I ran down at once to have a look at him. He was still in thestrait-waistcoat and in the padded room, but the suffused look had gonefrom his face, and his eyes had something of their old pleading--I mightalmost say, “cringing”--softness. I was satisfied with his presentcondition, and directed him to be relieved. The attendants hesitated,but finally carried out my wishes without protest. It was a strangething that the patient had humour enough to see their distrust, for,coming close to me, he said in a whisper, all the while lookingfurtively at them:--“They think I could hurt you! Fancy _me_ hurting _you_! The fools!”It was soothing, somehow, to the feelings to find myself dissociatedeven in the mind of this poor madman from the others; but all the same Ido not follow his thought. Am I to take it that I have anything incommon with him, so that we are, as it were, to stand together; or hashe to gain from me some good so stupendous that my well-being is needfulto him? I must find out later on. To-night he will not speak. Even theoffer of a kitten or even a full-grown cat will not tempt him. He willonly say: “I don’t take any stock in cats. I have more to think of now,and I can wait; I can wait.”After a while I left him. The attendant tells me that he was quietuntil just before dawn, and that then he began to get uneasy, and atlength violent, until at last he fell into a paroxysm which exhaustedhim so that he swooned into a sort of coma.*       *       *       *       *... Three nights has the same thing happened--violent all day then quietfrom moonrise to sunrise. I wish I could get some clue to the cause. Itwould almost seem as if there was some influence which came and went.Happy thought! We shall to-night play sane wits against mad ones. Heescaped before without our help; to-night he shall escape with it. Weshall give him a chance, and have the men ready to follow in case theyare required....*       *       *       *       *_23 August._--“The unexpected always happens.” How well Disraeli knewlife. Our bird when he found the cage open would not fly, so all oursubtle arrangements were for nought. At any rate, we have proved onething; that the spells of quietness last a reasonable time. We shall infuture be able to ease his bonds for a few hours each day. I have givenorders to the night attendant merely to shut him in the padded room,when once he is quiet, until an hour before sunrise. The poor soul’sbody will enjoy the relief even if his mind cannot appreciate it. Hark!The unexpected again! I am called; the patient has once more escaped.*       *       *       *       *_Later._--Another night adventure. Renfield artfully waited until theattendant was entering the room to inspect. Then he dashed out past himand flew down the passage. I sent word for the attendants to follow.Again he went into the grounds of the deserted house, and we found himin the same place, pressed against the old chapel door. When he saw mehe became furious, and had not the attendants seized him in time, hewould have tried to kill me. As we were holding him a strange thinghappened. He suddenly redoubled his efforts, and then as suddenly grewcalm. I looked round instinctively, but could see nothing. Then I caughtthe patient’s eye and followed it, but could trace nothing as it lookedinto the moonlit sky except a big bat, which was flapping its silent andghostly way to the west. Bats usually wheel and flit about, but this oneseemed to go straight on, as if it knew where it was bound for or hadsome intention of its own. The patient grew calmer every instant, andpresently said:--“You needn’t tie me; I shall go quietly!” Without trouble we came backto the house. I feel there is something ominous in his calm, and shallnot forget this night...._Lucy Westenra’s Diary__Hillingham, 24 August._--I must imitate Mina, and keep writing thingsdown. Then we can have long talks when we do meet. I wonder when it willbe. I wish she were with me again, for I feel so unhappy. Last night Iseemed to be dreaming again just as I was at Whitby. Perhaps it is thechange of air, or getting home again. It is all dark and horrid to me,for I can remember nothing; but I am full of vague fear, and I feel soweak and worn out. When Arthur came to lunch he looked quite grievedwhen he saw me, and I hadn’t the spirit to try to be cheerful. I wonderif I could sleep in mother’s room to-night. I shall make an excuse andtry.*       *       *       *       *_25 August._--Another bad night. Mother did not seem to take to myproposal. She seems not too well herself, and doubtless she fears toworry me. I tried to keep awake, and succeeded for a while; but when theclock struck twelve it waked me from a doze, so I must have been fallingasleep. There was a sort of scratching or flapping at the window, but Idid not mind it, and as I remember no more, I suppose I must then havefallen asleep. More bad dreams. I wish I could remember them. Thismorning I am horribly weak. My face is ghastly pale, and my throat painsme. It must be something wrong with my lungs, for I don’t seem ever toget air enough. I shall try to cheer up when Arthur comes, or else Iknow he will be miserable to see me so._Letter, Arthur Holmwood to Dr. Seward._“_Albemarle Hotel, 31 August._“My dear Jack,--“I want you to do me a favour. Lucy is ill; that is, she has no specialdisease, but she looks awful, and is getting worse every day. I haveasked her if there is any cause; I do not dare to ask her mother, for todisturb the poor lady’s mind about her daughter in her present state ofhealth would be fatal. Mrs. Westenra has confided to me that her doom isspoken--disease of the heart--though poor Lucy does not know it yet. Iam sure that there is something preying on my dear girl’s mind. I amalmost distracted when I think of her; to look at her gives me a pang. Itold her I should ask you to see her, and though she demurred atfirst--I know why, old fellow--she finally consented. It will be apainful task for you, I know, old friend, but it is for _her_ sake, andI must not hesitate to ask, or you to act. You are to come to lunch atHillingham to-morrow, two o’clock, so as not to arouse any suspicion inMrs. Westenra, and after lunch Lucy will take an opportunity of beingalone with you. I shall come in for tea, and we can go away together; Iam filled with anxiety, and want to consult with you alone as soon as Ican after you have seen her. Do not fail!“ARTHUR.”_Telegram, Arthur Holmwood to Seward._“_1 September._“Am summoned to see my father, who is worse. Am writing. Write me fullyby to-night’s post to Ring. Wire me if necessary.”_Letter from Dr. Seward to Arthur Holmwood._“_2 September._“My dear old fellow,--“With regard to Miss Westenra’s health I hasten to let you know at oncethat in my opinion there is not any functional disturbance or any maladythat I know of. At the same time, I am not by any means satisfied withher appearance; she is woefully different from what she was when I sawher last. Of course you must bear in mind that I did not have fullopportunity of examination such as I should wish; our very friendshipmakes a little difficulty which not even medical science or custom canbridge over. I had better tell you exactly what happened, leaving you todraw, in a measure, your own conclusions. I shall then say what I havedone and propose doing.“I found Miss Westenra in seemingly gay spirits. Her mother was present,and in a few seconds I made up my mind that she was trying all she knewto mislead her mother and prevent her from being anxious. I have nodoubt she guesses, if she does not know, what need of caution there is.We lunched alone, and as we all exerted ourselves to be cheerful, wegot, as some kind of reward for our labours, some real cheerfulnessamongst us. Then Mrs. Westenra went to lie down, and Lucy was left withme. We went into her boudoir, and till we got there her gaiety remained,for the servants were coming and going. As soon as the door was closed,however, the mask fell from her face, and she sank down into a chairwith a great sigh, and hid her eyes with her hand. When I saw that herhigh spirits had failed, I at once took advantage of her reaction tomake a diagnosis. She said to me very sweetly:--“‘I cannot tell you how I loathe talking about myself.’ I reminded herthat a doctor’s confidence was sacred, but that you were grievouslyanxious about her. She caught on to my meaning at once, and settled thatmatter in a word. ‘Tell Arthur everything you choose. I do not care formyself, but all for him!’ So I am quite free.“I could easily see that she is somewhat bloodless, but I could not seethe usual anæmic signs, and by a chance I was actually able to test thequality of her blood, for in opening a window which was stiff a cordgave way, and she cut her hand slightly with broken glass. It was aslight matter in itself, but it gave me an evident chance, and I secureda few drops of the blood and have analysed them. The qualitativeanalysis gives a quite normal condition, and shows, I should infer, initself a vigorous state of health. In other physical matters I was quitesatisfied that there is no need for anxiety; but as there must be acause somewhere, I have come to the conclusion that it must be somethingmental. She complains of difficulty in breathing satisfactorily attimes, and of heavy, lethargic sleep, with dreams that frighten her, butregarding which she can remember nothing. She says that as a child sheused to walk in her sleep, and that when in Whitby the habit came back,and that once she walked out in the night and went to East Cliff, whereMiss Murray found her; but she assures me that of late the habit has notreturned. I am in doubt, and so have done the best thing I know of; Ihave written to my old friend and master, Professor Van Helsing, ofAmsterdam, who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one in theworld. I have asked him to come over, and as you told me that all thingswere to be at your charge, I have mentioned to him who you are and yourrelations to Miss Westenra. This, my dear fellow, is in obedience toyour wishes, for I am only too proud and happy to do anything I can forher. Van Helsing would, I know, do anything for me for a personalreason, so, no matter on what ground he comes, we must accept hiswishes. He is a seemingly arbitrary man, but this is because he knowswhat he is talking about better than any one else. He is a philosopherand a metaphysician, and one of the most advanced scientists of his day;and he has, I believe, an absolutely open mind. This, with an ironnerve, a temper of the ice-brook, an indomitable resolution,self-command, and toleration exalted from virtues to blessings, and thekindliest and truest heart that beats--these form his equipment for thenoble work that he is doing for mankind--work both in theory andpractice, for his views are as wide as his all-embracing sympathy. Itell you these facts that you may know why I have such confidence inhim. I have asked him to come at once. I shall see Miss Westenrato-morrow again. She is to meet me at the Stores, so that I may notalarm her mother by too early a repetition of my call.“Yours always,“JOHN SEWARD.”_Letter, Abraham Van Helsing, M. D., D. Ph., D. Lit., etc., etc., to Dr.Seward._“_2 September._“My good Friend,--“When I have received your letter I am already coming to you. By goodfortune I can leave just at once, without wrong to any of those who havetrusted me. Were fortune other, then it were bad for those who havetrusted, for I come to my friend when he call me to aid those he holdsdear. Tell your friend that when that time you suck from my wound soswiftly the poison of the gangrene from that knife that our otherfriend, too nervous, let slip, you did more for him when he wants myaids and you call for them than all his great fortune could do. But itis pleasure added to do for him, your friend; it is to you that I come.Have then rooms for me at the Great Eastern Hotel, so that I may be nearto hand, and please it so arrange that we may see the young lady not toolate on to-morrow, for it is likely that I may have to return here thatnight. But if need be I shall come again in three days, and stay longerif it must. Till then good-bye, my friend John.“VAN HELSING.”_Letter, Dr. Seward to Hon. Arthur Holmwood._“_3 September._“My dear Art,--“Van Helsing has come and gone. He came on with me to Hillingham, andfound that, by Lucy’s discretion, her mother was lunching out, so thatwe were alone with her. Van Helsing made a very careful examination ofthe patient. He is to report to me, and I shall advise you, for ofcourse I was not present all the time. He is, I fear, much concerned,but says he must think. When I told him of our friendship and how youtrust to me in the matter, he said: ‘You must tell him all you think.Tell him what I think, if you can guess it, if you will. Nay, I am notjesting. This is no jest, but life and death, perhaps more.’ I askedwhat he meant by that, for he was very serious. This was when we hadcome back to town, and he was having a cup of tea before starting on hisreturn to Amsterdam. He would not give me any further clue. You must notbe angry with me, Art, because his very reticence means that all hisbrains are working for her good. He will speak plainly enough when thetime comes, be sure. So I told him I would simply write an account ofour visit, just as if I were doing a descriptive special article for_The Daily Telegraph_. He seemed not to notice, but remarked that thesmuts in London were not quite so bad as they used to be when he was astudent here. I am to get his report to-morrow if he can possibly makeit. In any case I am to have a letter.“Well, as to the visit. Lucy was more cheerful than on the day I firstsaw her, and certainly looked better. She had lost something of theghastly look that so upset you, and her breathing was normal. She wasvery sweet to the professor (as she always is), and tried to make himfeel at ease; though I could see that the poor girl was making a hardstruggle for it. I believe Van Helsing saw it, too, for I saw the quicklook under his bushy brows that I knew of old. Then he began to chat ofall things except ourselves and diseases and with such an infinitegeniality that I could see poor Lucy’s pretense of animation merge intoreality. Then, without any seeming change, he brought the conversationgently round to his visit, and suavely said:--“‘My dear young miss, I have the so great pleasure because you are somuch beloved. That is much, my dear, ever were there that which I do notsee. They told me you were down in the spirit, and that you were of aghastly pale. To them I say: “Pouf!”’ And he snapped his fingers at meand went on: ‘But you and I shall show them how wrong they are. How canhe’--and he pointed at me with the same look and gesture as that withwhich once he pointed me out to his class, on, or rather after, aparticular occasion which he never fails to remind me of--‘know anythingof a young ladies? He has his madmans to play with, and to bring themback to happiness, and to those that love them. It is much to do, and,oh, but there are rewards, in that we can bestow such happiness. But theyoung ladies! He has no wife nor daughter, and the young do not tellthemselves to the young, but to the old, like me, who have known so manysorrows and the causes of them. So, my dear, we will send him away tosmoke the cigarette in the garden, whiles you and I have little talk allto ourselves.’ I took the hint, and strolled about, and presently theprofessor came to the window and called me in. He looked grave, butsaid: ‘I have made careful examination, but there is no functionalcause. With you I agree that there has been much blood lost; it hasbeen, but is not. But the conditions of her are in no way anæmic. I haveasked her to send me her maid, that I may ask just one or two question,that so I may not chance to miss nothing. I know well what she will say.And yet there is cause; there is always cause for everything. I must goback home and think. You must send to me the telegram every day; and ifthere be cause I shall come again. The disease--for not to be all wellis a disease--interest me, and the sweet young dear, she interest metoo. She charm me, and for her, if not for you or disease, I come.’“As I tell you, he would not say a word more, even when we were alone.And so now, Art, you know all I know. I shall keep stern watch. I trustyour poor father is rallying. It must be a terrible thing to you, mydear old fellow, to be placed in such a position between two people whoare both so dear to you. I know your idea of duty to your father, andyou are right to stick to it; but, if need be, I shall send you word tocome at once to Lucy; so do not be over-anxious unless you hear fromme.”_Dr. Seward’s Diary.__4 September._--Zoöphagous patient still keeps up our interest in him.He had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time. Justbefore the stroke of noon he began to grow restless. The attendant knewthe symptoms, and at once summoned aid. Fortunately the men came at arun, and were just in time, for at the stroke of noon he became soviolent that it took all their strength to hold him. In about fiveminutes, however, he began to get more and more quiet, and finally sankinto a sort of melancholy, in which state he has remained up to now. Theattendant tells me that his screams whilst in the paroxysm were reallyappalling; I found my hands full when I got in, attending to some of theother patients who were frightened by him. Indeed, I can quiteunderstand the effect, for the sounds disturbed even me, though I wassome distance away. It is now after the dinner-hour of the asylum, andas yet my patient sits in a corner brooding, with a dull, sullen,woe-begone look in his face, which seems rather to indicate than to showsomething directly. I cannot quite understand it.*       *       *       *       *_Later._--Another change in my patient. At five o’clock I looked in onhim, and found him seemingly as happy and contented as he used to be. Hewas catching flies and eating them, and was keeping note of his captureby making nail-marks on the edge of the door between the ridges ofpadding. When he saw me, he came over and apologised for his badconduct, and asked me in a very humble, cringing way to be led back tohis own room and to have his note-book again. I thought it well tohumour him: so he is back in his room with the window open. He has thesugar of his tea spread out on the window-sill, and is reaping quite aharvest of flies. He is not now eating them, but putting them into abox, as of old, and is already examining the corners of his room to finda spider. I tried to get him to talk about the past few days, for anyclue to his thoughts would be of immense help to me; but he would notrise. For a moment or two he looked very sad, and said in a sort offar-away voice, as though saying it rather to himself than to me:--“All over! all over! He has deserted me. No hope for me now unless I doit for myself!” Then suddenly turning to me in a resolute way, he said:“Doctor, won’t you be very good to me and let me have a little moresugar? I think it would be good for me.”“And the flies?” I said.“Yes! The flies like it, too, and I like the flies; therefore I likeit.” And there are people who know so little as to think that madmen donot argue. I procured him a double supply, and left him as happy a manas, I suppose, any in the world. I wish I could fathom his mind.*       *       *       *       *_Midnight._--Another change in him. I had been to see Miss Westenra,whom I found much better, and had just returned, and was standing at ourown gate looking at the sunset, when once more I heard him yelling. Ashis room is on this side of the house, I could hear it better than inthe morning. It was a shock to me to turn from the wonderful smokybeauty of a sunset over London, with its lurid lights and inky shadowsand all the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even as on foulwater, and to realise all the grim sternness of my own cold stonebuilding, with its wealth of breathing misery, and my own desolate heartto endure it all. I reached him just as the sun was going down, and fromhis window saw the red disc sink. As it sank he became less and lessfrenzied; and just as it dipped he slid from the hands that held him, aninert mass, on the floor. It is wonderful, however, what intellectualrecuperative power lunatics have, for within a few minutes he stood upquite calmly and looked around him. I signalled to the attendants not tohold him, for I was anxious to see what he would do. He went straightover to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar; then he took hisfly-box, and emptied it outside, and threw away the box; then he shutthe window, and crossing over, sat down on his bed. All this surprisedme, so I asked him: “Are you not going to keep flies any more?”“No,” said he; “I am sick of all that rubbish!” He certainly is awonderfully interesting study. I wish I could get some glimpse of hismind or of the cause of his sudden passion. Stop; there may be a clueafter all, if we can find why to-day his paroxysms came on at high noonand at sunset. Can it be that there is a malign influence of the sun atperiods which affects certain natures--as at times the moon does others?We shall see._Telegram, Seward, London, to Van Helsing, Amsterdam._“_4 September._--Patient still better to-day.”_Telegram, Seward, London, to Van Helsing, Amsterdam._“_5 September._--Patient greatly improved. Good appetite; sleepsnaturally; good spirits; colour coming back.”_Telegram, Seward, London, to Van Helsing, Amsterdam._“_6 September._--Terrible change for the worse. Come at once; do notlose an hour. I hold over telegram to Holmwood till have seen you.”CHAPTER X_Letter, Dr. Seward to Hon. Arthur Holmwood._“_6 September._“My dear Art,--“My news to-day is not so good. Lucy this morning had gone back a bit.There is, however, one good thing which has arisen from it; Mrs.Westenra was naturally anxious concerning Lucy, and has consulted meprofessionally about her. I took advantage of the opportunity, and toldher that my old master, Van Helsing, the great specialist, was coming tostay with me, and that I would put her in his charge conjointly withmyself; so now we can come and go without alarming her unduly, for ashock to her would mean sudden death, and this, in Lucy’s weakcondition, might be disastrous to her. We are hedged in withdifficulties, all of us, my poor old fellow; but, please God, we shallcome through them all right. If any need I shall write, so that, if youdo not hear from me, take it for granted that I am simply waiting fornews. In haste“Yours ever,“JOHN SEWARD.”_Dr. Seward’s Diary.__7 September._--The first thing Van Helsing said to me when we met atLiverpool Street was:--“Have you said anything to our young friend the lover of her?”“No,” I said. “I waited till I had seen you, as I said in my telegram. Iwrote him a letter simply telling him that you were coming, as MissWestenra was not so well, and that I should let him know if need be.”“Right, my friend,” he said, “quite right! Better he not know as yet;perhaps he shall never know. I pray so; but if it be needed, then heshall know all. And, my good friend John, let me caution you. You dealwith the madmen. All men are mad in some way or the other; and inasmuchas you deal discreetly with your madmen, so deal with God’s madmen,too--the rest of the world. You tell not your madmen what you do nor whyyou do it; you tell them not what you think. So you shall keep knowledgein its place, where it may rest--where it may gather its kind around itand breed. You and I shall keep as yet what we know here, and here.” Hetouched me on the heart and on the forehead, and then touched himselfthe same way. “I have for myself thoughts at the present. Later I shallunfold to you.”“Why not now?” I asked. “It may do some good; we may arrive at somedecision.” He stopped and looked at me, and said:--“My friend John, when the corn is grown, even before it hasripened--while the milk of its mother-earth is in him, and the sunshinehas not yet begun to paint him with his gold, the husbandman he pull theear and rub him between his rough hands, and blow away the green chaff,and say to you: ‘Look! he’s good corn; he will make good crop when thetime comes.’” I did not see the application, and told him so. For replyhe reached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully, ashe used long ago to do at lectures, and said: “The good husbandman tellyou so then because he knows, but not till then. But you do not find thegood husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if he grow; that is forthe children who play at husbandry, and not for those who take it as ofthe work of their life. See you now, friend John? I have sown my corn,and Nature has her work to do in making it sprout; if he sprout at all,there’s some promise; and I wait till the ear begins to swell.” He brokeoff, for he evidently saw that I understood. Then he went on, and verygravely:--“You were always a careful student, and your case-book was ever morefull than the rest. You were only student then; now you are master, andI trust that good habit have not fail. Remember, my friend, thatknowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not trust the weaker.Even if you have not kept the good practise, let me tell you that thiscase of our dear miss is one that may be--mind, I say _may be_--of suchinterest to us and others that all the rest may not make him kick thebeam, as your peoples say. Take then good note of it. Nothing is toosmall. I counsel you, put down in record even your doubts and surmises.Hereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess. Welearn from failure, not from success!”When I described Lucy’s symptoms--the same as before, but infinitelymore marked--he looked very grave, but said nothing. He took with him abag in which were many instruments and drugs, “the ghastly paraphernaliaof our beneficial trade,” as he once called, in one of his lectures, theequipment of a professor of the healing craft. When we were shown in,Mrs. Westenra met us. She was alarmed, but not nearly so much as Iexpected to find her. Nature in one of her beneficent moods has ordainedthat even death has some antidote to its own terrors. Here, in a casewhere any shock may prove fatal, matters are so ordered that, from somecause or other, the things not personal--even the terrible change in herdaughter to whom she is so attached--do not seem to reach her. It issomething like the way Dame Nature gathers round a foreign body anenvelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil thatwhich it would otherwise harm by contact. If this be an orderedselfishness, then we should pause before we condemn any one for the viceof egoism, for there may be deeper root for its causes than we haveknowledge of.I used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology, and laid downa rule that she should not be present with Lucy or think of her illnessmore than was absolutely required. She assented readily, so readily thatI saw again the hand of Nature fighting for life. Van Helsing and I wereshown up to Lucy’s room. If I was shocked when I saw her yesterday, Iwas horrified when I saw her to-day. She was ghastly, chalkily pale; thered seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums, and the bones ofher face stood out prominently; her breathing was painful to see orhear. Van Helsing’s face grew set as marble, and his eyebrows convergedtill they almost touched over his nose. Lucy lay motionless, and did notseem to have strength to speak, so for a while we were all silent. ThenVan Helsing beckoned to me, and we went gently out of the room. Theinstant we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage tothe next door, which was open. Then he pulled me quickly in with him andclosed the door. “My God!” he said; “this is dreadful. There is no timeto be lost. She will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heart’saction as it should be. There must be transfusion of blood at once. Isit you or me?”“I am younger and stronger, Professor. It must be me.”“Then get ready at once. I will bring up my bag. I am prepared.”I went downstairs with him, and as we were going there was a knock atthe hall-door. When we reached the hall the maid had just opened thedoor, and Arthur was stepping quickly in. He rushed up to me, saying inan eager whisper:--“Jack, I was so anxious. I read between the lines of your letter, andhave been in an agony. The dad was better, so I ran down here to see formyself. Is not that gentleman Dr. Van Helsing? I am so thankful to you,sir, for coming.” When first the Professor’s eye had lit upon him he hadbeen angry at his interruption at such a time; but now, as he took inhis stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young manhood whichseemed to emanate from him, his eyes gleamed. Without a pause he said tohim gravely as he held out his hand:--“Sir, you have come in time. You are the lover of our dear miss. She isbad, very, very bad. Nay, my child, do not go like that.” For hesuddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting. “You are tohelp her. You can do more than any that live, and your courage is yourbest help.”“What can I do?” asked Arthur hoarsely. “Tell me, and I shall do it. Mylife is hers, and I would give the last drop of blood in my body forher.” The Professor has a strongly humorous side, and I could from oldknowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer:--“My young sir, I do not ask so much as that--not the last!”“What shall I do?” There was fire in his eyes, and his open nostrilquivered with intent. Van Helsing slapped him on the shoulder. “Come!”he said. “You are a man, and it is a man we want. You are better thanme, better than my friend John.” Arthur looked bewildered, and theProfessor went on by explaining in a kindly way:--“Young miss is bad, very bad. She wants blood, and blood she must haveor die. My friend John and I have consulted; and we are about to performwhat we call transfusion of blood--to transfer from full veins of one tothe empty veins which pine for him. John was to give his blood, as he isthe more young and strong than me”--here Arthur took my hand and wrungit hard in silence--“but, now you are here, you are more good than us,old or young, who toil much in the world of thought. Our nerves are notso calm and our blood not so bright than yours!” Arthur turned to himand said:--“If you only knew how gladly I would die for her you wouldunderstand----”He stopped, with a sort of choke in his voice.“Good boy!” said Van Helsing. “In the not-so-far-off you will be happythat you have done all for her you love. Come now and be silent. Youshall kiss her once before it is done, but then you must go; and youmust leave at my sign. Say no word to Madame; you know how it is withher! There must be no shock; any knowledge of this would be one. Come!”We all went up to Lucy’s room. Arthur by direction remained outside.Lucy turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing. She was notasleep, but she was simply too weak to make the effort. Her eyes spoketo us; that was all. Van Helsing took some things from his bag and laidthem on a little table out of sight. Then he mixed a narcotic, andcoming over to the bed, said cheerily:--“Now, little miss, here is your medicine. Drink it off, like a goodchild. See, I lift you so that to swallow is easy. Yes.” She had madethe effort with success.It astonished me how long the drug took to act. This, in fact, markedthe extent of her weakness. The time seemed endless until sleep began toflicker in her eyelids. At last, however, the narcotic began to manifestits potency; and she fell into a deep sleep. When the Professor wassatisfied he called Arthur into the room, and bade him strip off hiscoat. Then he added: “You may take that one little kiss whiles I bringover the table. Friend John, help to me!” So neither of us looked whilsthe bent over her.Van Helsing turning to me, said:“He is so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need notdefibrinate it.”Then with swiftness, but with absolute method, Van Helsing performed theoperation. As the transfusion went on something like life seemed to comeback to poor Lucy’s cheeks, and through Arthur’s growing pallor the joyof his face seemed absolutely to shine. After a bit I began to growanxious, for the loss of blood was telling on Arthur, strong man as hewas. It gave me an idea of what a terrible strain Lucy’s system musthave undergone that what weakened Arthur only partially restored her.But the Professor’s face was set, and he stood watch in hand and withhis eyes fixed now on the patient and now on Arthur. I could hear my ownheart beat. Presently he said in a soft voice: “Do not stir an instant.It is enough. You attend him; I will look to her.” When all was over Icould see how much Arthur was weakened. I dressed the wound and took hisarm to bring him away, when Van Helsing spoke without turning round--theman seems to have eyes in the back of his head:--“The brave lover, I think, deserve another kiss, which he shall havepresently.” And as he had now finished his operation, he adjusted thepillow to the patient’s head. As he did so the narrow black velvet bandwhich she seems always to wear round her throat, buckled with an olddiamond buckle which her lover had given her, was dragged a little up,and showed a red mark on her throat. Arthur did not notice it, but Icould hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of Van Helsing’sways of betraying emotion. He said nothing at the moment, but turned tome, saying: “Now take down our brave young lover, give him of the portwine, and let him lie down a while. He must then go home and rest, sleepmuch and eat much, that he may be recruited of what he has so given tohis love. He must not stay here. Hold! a moment. I may take it, sir,that you are anxious of result. Then bring it with you that in all waysthe operation is successful. You have saved her life this time, and youcan go home and rest easy in mind that all that can be is. I shall tellher all when she is well; she shall love you none the less for what youhave done. Good-bye.”When Arthur had gone I went back to the room. Lucy was sleeping gently,but her breathing was stronger; I could see the counterpane move as herbreast heaved. By the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at her intently.The velvet band again covered the red mark. I asked the Professor in awhisper:--“What do you make of that mark on her throat?”“What do you make of it?”“I have not examined it yet,” I answered, and then and there proceededto loose the band. Just over the external jugular vein there were twopunctures, not large, but not wholesome-looking. There was no sign ofdisease, but the edges were white and worn-looking, as if by sometrituration. It at once occurred to me that this wound, or whatever itwas, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood; but I abandonedthe idea as soon as formed, for such a thing could not be. The whole bedwould have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl musthave lost to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusion.“Well?” said Van Helsing.“Well,” said I, “I can make nothing of it.” The Professor stood up. “Imust go back to Amsterdam to-night,” he said. “There are books andthings there which I want. You must remain here all the night, and youmust not let your sight pass from her.”“Shall I have a nurse?” I asked.“We are the best nurses, you and I. You keep watch all night; see thatshe is well fed, and that nothing disturbs her. You must not sleep allthe night. Later on we can sleep, you and I. I shall be back as soon aspossible. And then we may begin.”“May begin?” I said. “What on earth do you mean?”“We shall see!” he answered, as he hurried out. He came back a momentlater and put his head inside the door and said with warning finger heldup:--“Remember, she is your charge. If you leave her, and harm befall, youshall not sleep easy hereafter!”_Dr. Seward’s Diary--continued.__8 September._--I sat up all night with Lucy. The opiate worked itselfoff towards dusk, and she waked naturally; she looked a different beingfrom what she had been before the operation. Her spirits even were good,and she was full of a happy vivacity, but I could see evidences of theabsolute prostration which she had undergone. When I told Mrs. Westenrathat Dr. Van Helsing had directed that I should sit up with her shealmost pooh-poohed the idea, pointing out her daughter’s renewedstrength and excellent spirits. I was firm, however, and madepreparations for my long vigil. When her maid had prepared her for thenight I came in, having in the meantime had supper, and took a seat bythe bedside. She did not in any way make objection, but looked at megratefully whenever I caught her eye. After a long spell she seemedsinking off to sleep, but with an effort seemed to pull herself togetherand shook it off. This was repeated several times, with greater effortand with shorter pauses as the time moved on. It was apparent that shedid not want to sleep, so I tackled the subject at once:--“You do not want to go to sleep?”“No; I am afraid.”“Afraid to go to sleep! Why so? It is the boon we all crave for.”“Ah, not if you were like me--if sleep was to you a presage of horror!”“A presage of horror! What on earth do you mean?”“I don’t know; oh, I don’t know. And that is what is so terrible. Allthis weakness comes to me in sleep; until I dread the very thought.”“But, my dear girl, you may sleep to-night. I am here watching you, andI can promise that nothing will happen.”“Ah, I can trust you!” I seized the opportunity, and said: “I promiseyou that if I see any evidence of bad dreams I will wake you at once.”“You will? Oh, will you really? How good you are to me. Then I willsleep!” And almost at the word she gave a deep sigh of relief, and sankback, asleep.All night long I watched by her. She never stirred, but slept on and onin a deep, tranquil, life-giving, health-giving sleep. Her lips wereslightly parted, and her breast rose and fell with the regularity of apendulum. There was a smile on her face, and it was evident that no baddreams had come to disturb her peace of mind.In the early morning her maid came, and I left her in her care and tookmyself back home, for I was anxious about many things. I sent a shortwire to Van Helsing and to Arthur, telling them of the excellent resultof the operation. My own work, with its manifold arrears, took me allday to clear off; it was dark when I was able to inquire about myzoöphagous patient. The report was good; he had been quite quiet for thepast day and night. A telegram came from Van Helsing at Amsterdam whilstI was at dinner, suggesting that I should be at Hillingham to-night, asit might be well to be at hand, and stating that he was leaving by thenight mail and would join me early in the morning.*       *       *       *       *_9 September_.--I was pretty tired and worn out when I got toHillingham. For two nights I had hardly had a wink of sleep, and mybrain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebralexhaustion. Lucy was up and in cheerful spirits. When she shook handswith me she looked sharply in my face and said:--“No sitting up to-night for you. You are worn out. I am quite wellagain; indeed, I am; and if there is to be any sitting up, it is I whowill sit up with you.” I would not argue the point, but went and had mysupper. Lucy came with me, and, enlivened by her charming presence, Imade an excellent meal, and had a couple of glasses of the more thanexcellent port. Then Lucy took me upstairs, and showed me a room nexther own, where a cozy fire was burning. “Now,” she said, “you must stayhere. I shall leave this door open and my door too. You can lie on thesofa for I know that nothing would induce any of you doctors to go tobed whilst there is a patient above the horizon. If I want anything Ishall call out, and you can come to me at once.” I could not butacquiesce, for I was “dog-tired,” and could not have sat up had I tried.So, on her renewing her promise to call me if she should want anything,I lay on the sofa, and forgot all about everything._Lucy Westenra’s Diary.__9 September._--I feel so happy to-night. I have been so miserably weak,that to be able to think and move about is like feeling sunshine aftera long spell of east wind out of a steel sky. Somehow Arthur feels very,very close to me. I seem to feel his presence warm about me. I supposeit is that sickness and weakness are selfish things and turn our innereyes and sympathy on ourselves, whilst health and strength give Loverein, and in thought and feeling he can wander where he wills. I knowwhere my thoughts are. If Arthur only knew! My dear, my dear, your earsmust tingle as you sleep, as mine do waking. Oh, the blissful rest oflast night! How I slept, with that dear, good Dr. Seward watching me.And to-night I shall not fear to sleep, since he is close at hand andwithin call. Thank everybody for being so good to me! Thank God!Good-night, Arthur._Dr. Seward’s Diary.__10 September._--I was conscious of the Professor’s hand on my head, andstarted awake all in a second. That is one of the things that we learnin an asylum, at any rate.“And how is our patient?”“Well, when I left her, or rather when she left me,” I answered.“Come, let us see,” he said. And together we went into the room.The blind was down, and I went over to raise it gently, whilst VanHelsing stepped, with his soft, cat-like tread, over to the bed.As I raised the blind, and the morning sunlight flooded the room, Iheard the Professor’s low hiss of inspiration, and knowing its rarity, adeadly fear shot through my heart. As I passed over he moved back, andhis exclamation of horror, “Gott in Himmel!” needed no enforcement fromhis agonised face. He raised his hand and pointed to the bed, and hisiron face was drawn and ashen white. I felt my knees begin to tremble.There on the bed, seemingly in a swoon, lay poor Lucy, more horriblywhite and wan-looking than ever. Even the lips were white, and the gumsseemed to have shrunken back from the teeth, as we sometimes see in acorpse after a prolonged illness. Van Helsing raised his foot to stampin anger, but the instinct of his life and all the long years of habitstood to him, and he put it down again softly. “Quick!” he said. “Bringthe brandy.” I flew to the dining-room, and returned with the decanter.He wetted the poor white lips with it, and together we rubbed palm andwrist and heart. He felt her heart, and after a few moments of agonisingsuspense said:--“It is not too late. It beats, though but feebly. All our work isundone; we must begin again. There is no young Arthur here now; I haveto call on you yourself this time, friend John.” As he spoke, he wasdipping into his bag and producing the instruments for transfusion; Ihad taken off my coat and rolled up my shirt-sleeve. There was nopossibility of an opiate just at present, and no need of one; and so,without a moment’s delay, we began the operation. After a time--it didnot seem a short time either, for the draining away of one’s blood, nomatter how willingly it be given, is a terrible feeling--Van Helsingheld up a warning finger. “Do not stir,” he said, “but I fear that withgrowing strength she may wake; and that would make danger, oh, so muchdanger. But I shall precaution take. I shall give hypodermic injectionof morphia.” He proceeded then, swiftly and deftly, to carry out hisintent. The effect on Lucy was not bad, for the faint seemed to mergesubtly into the narcotic sleep. It was with a feeling of personal pridethat I could see a faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallidcheeks and lips. No man knows, till he experiences it, what it is tofeel his own life-blood drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves.The Professor watched me critically. “That will do,” he said. “Already?”I remonstrated. “You took a great deal more from Art.” To which hesmiled a sad sort of smile as he replied:--“He is her lover, her _fiancé_. You have work, much work, to do for herand for others; and the present will suffice.”When we stopped the operation, he attended to Lucy, whilst I applieddigital pressure to my own incision. I laid down, whilst I waited hisleisure to attend to me, for I felt faint and a little sick. By-and-byhe bound up my wound, and sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine formyself. As I was leaving the room, he came after me, and halfwhispered:--“Mind, nothing must be said of this. If our young lover should turn upunexpected, as before, no word to him. It would at once frighten him andenjealous him, too. There must be none. So!”When I came back he looked at me carefully, and then said:--“You are not much the worse. Go into the room, and lie on your sofa, andrest awhile; then have much breakfast, and come here to me.”I followed out his orders, for I knew how right and wise they were. Ihad done my part, and now my next duty was to keep up my strength. Ifelt very weak, and in the weakness lost something of the amazement atwhat had occurred. I fell asleep on the sofa, however, wondering overand over again how Lucy had made such a retrograde movement, and howshe could have been drained of so much blood with no sign anywhere toshow for it. I think I must have continued my wonder in my dreams, for,sleeping and waking, my thoughts always came back to the littlepunctures in her throat and the ragged, exhausted appearance of theiredges--tiny though they were.Lucy slept well into the day, and when she woke she was fairly well andstrong, though not nearly so much so as the day before. When Van Helsinghad seen her, he went out for a walk, leaving me in charge, with strictinjunctions that I was not to leave her for a moment. I could hear hisvoice in the hall, asking the way to the nearest telegraph office.Lucy chatted with me freely, and seemed quite unconscious that anythinghad happened. I tried to keep her amused and interested. When her mothercame up to see her, she did not seem to notice any change whatever, butsaid to me gratefully:--“We owe you so much, Dr. Seward, for all you have done, but you reallymust now take care not to overwork yourself. You are looking paleyourself. You want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit; that youdo!” As she spoke, Lucy turned crimson, though it was only momentarily,for her poor wasted veins could not stand for long such an unwonteddrain to the head. The reaction came in excessive pallor as she turnedimploring eyes on me. I smiled and nodded, and laid my finger on mylips; with a sigh, she sank back amid her pillows.Van Helsing returned in a couple of hours, and presently said to me:“Now you go home, and eat much and drink enough. Make yourself strong. Istay here to-night, and I shall sit up with little miss myself. You andI must watch the case, and we must have none other to know. I have gravereasons. No, do not ask them; think what you will. Do not fear to thinkeven the most not-probable. Good-night.”In the hall two of the maids came to me, and asked if they or either ofthem might not sit up with Miss Lucy. They implored me to let them; andwhen I said it was Dr. Van Helsing’s wish that either he or I should situp, they asked me quite piteously to intercede with the “foreigngentleman.” I was much touched by their kindness. Perhaps it is becauseI am weak at present, and perhaps because it was on Lucy’s account, thattheir devotion was manifested; for over and over again have I seensimilar instances of woman’s kindness. I got back here in time for alate dinner; went my rounds--all well; and set this down whilst waitingfor sleep. It is coming.*       *       *       *       *_11 September._--This afternoon I went over to Hillingham. Found VanHelsing in excellent spirits, and Lucy much better. Shortly after I hadarrived, a big parcel from abroad came for the Professor. He opened itwith much impressment--assumed, of course--and showed a great bundle ofwhite flowers.“These are for you, Miss Lucy,” he said.“For me? Oh, Dr. Van Helsing!”“Yes, my dear, but not for you to play with. These are medicines.” HereLucy made a wry face. “Nay, but they are not to take in a decoction orin nauseous form, so you need not snub that so charming nose, or I shallpoint out to my friend Arthur what woes he may have to endure in seeingso much beauty that he so loves so much distort. Aha, my pretty miss,that bring the so nice nose all straight again. This is medicinal, butyou do not know how. I put him in your window, I make pretty wreath, andhang him round your neck, so that you sleep well. Oh yes! they, like thelotus flower, make your trouble forgotten. It smell so like the watersof Lethe, and of that fountain of youth that the Conquistadores soughtfor in the Floridas, and find him all too late.”Whilst he was speaking, Lucy had been examining the flowers and smellingthem. Now she threw them down, saying, with half-laughter, andhalf-disgust:--“Oh, Professor, I believe you are only putting up a joke on me. Why,these flowers are only common garlic.”To my surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said with all his sternness, hisiron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting:--“No trifling with me! I never jest! There is grim purpose in all I do;and I warn you that you do not thwart me. Take care, for the sake ofothers if not for your own.” Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she mightwell be, he went on more gently: “Oh, little miss, my dear, do not fearme. I only do for your good; but there is much virtue to you in those socommon flowers. See, I place them myself in your room. I make myself thewreath that you are to wear. But hush! no telling to others that make soinquisitive questions. We must obey, and silence is a part of obedience;and obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that waitfor you. Now sit still awhile. Come with me, friend John, and you shallhelp me deck the room with my garlic, which is all the way from Haarlem,where my friend Vanderpool raise herb in his glass-houses all the year.I had to telegraph yesterday, or they would not have been here.”We went into the room, taking the flowers with us. The Professor’sactions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopoeiathat I ever heard of. First he fastened up the windows and latched themsecurely; next, taking a handful of the flowers, he rubbed them all overthe sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might getin would be laden with the garlic smell. Then with the wisp he rubbedall over the jamb of the door, above, below, and at each side, and roundthe fireplace in the same way. It all seemed grotesque to me, andpresently I said:--“Well, Professor, I know you always have a reason for what you do, butthis certainly puzzles me. It is well we have no sceptic here, or hewould say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit.”“Perhaps I am!” he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath whichLucy was to wear round her neck.We then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night, and when shewas in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round herneck. The last words he said to her were:--“Take care you do not disturb it; and even if the room feel close, donot to-night open the window or the door.”“I promise,” said Lucy, “and thank you both a thousand times for allyour kindness to me! Oh, what have I done to be blessed with suchfriends?”As we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, Van Helsing said:--“To-night I can sleep in peace, and sleep I want--two nights of travel,much reading in the day between, and much anxiety on the day to follow,and a night to sit up, without to wink. To-morrow in the morning earlyyou call for me, and we come together to see our pretty miss, so muchmore strong for my ‘spell’ which I have work. Ho! ho!”He seemed so confident that I, remembering my own confidence two nightsbefore and with the baneful result, felt awe and vague terror. It musthave been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it to my friend, butI felt it all the more, like unshed tears.CHAPTER XI_Lucy Westenra’s Diary.__12 September._--How good they all are to me. I quite love that dear Dr.Van Helsing. I wonder why he was so anxious about these flowers. Hepositively frightened me, he was so fierce. And yet he must have beenright, for I feel comfort from them already. Somehow, I do not dreadbeing alone to-night, and I can go to sleep without fear. I shall notmind any flapping outside the window. Oh, the terrible struggle that Ihave had against sleep so often of late; the pain of the sleeplessness,or the pain of the fear of sleep, with such unknown horrors as it hasfor me! How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, nodreads; to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and bringsnothing but sweet dreams. Well, here I am to-night, hoping for sleep,and lying like Ophelia in the play, with “virgin crants and maidenstrewments.” I never liked garlic before, but to-night it is delightful!There is peace in its smell; I feel sleep coming already. Good-night,everybody._Dr. Seward’s Diary.__13 September._--Called at the Berkeley and found Van Helsing, as usual,up to time. The carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting. TheProfessor took his bag, which he always brings with him now.Let all be put down exactly. Van Helsing and I arrived at Hillingham ateight o’clock. It was a lovely morning; the bright sunshine and all thefresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion of nature’sannual work. The leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours,but had not yet begun to drop from the trees. When we entered we metMrs. Westenra coming out of the morning room. She is always an earlyriser. She greeted us warmly and said:--“You will be glad to know that Lucy is better. The dear child is stillasleep. I looked into her room and saw her, but did not go in, lest Ishould disturb her.” The Professor smiled, and looked quite jubilant. Herubbed his hands together, and said:--“Aha! I thought I had diagnosed the case. My treatment is working,” towhich she answered:--“You must not take all the credit to yourself, doctor. Lucy’s state thismorning is due in part to me.”“How you do mean, ma’am?” asked the Professor.“Well, I was anxious about the dear child in the night, and went intoher room. She was sleeping soundly--so soundly that even my coming didnot wake her. But the room was awfully stuffy. There were a lot of thosehorrible, strong-smelling flowers about everywhere, and she had actuallya bunch of them round her neck. I feared that the heavy odour would betoo much for the dear child in her weak state, so I took them all awayand opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air. You will bepleased with her, I am sure.”She moved off into her boudoir, where she usually breakfasted early. Asshe had spoken, I watched the Professor’s face, and saw it turn ashengrey. He had been able to retain his self-command whilst the poor ladywas present, for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would be;he actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass intoher room. But the instant she had disappeared he pulled me, suddenly andforcibly, into the dining-room and closed the door.Then, for the first time in my life, I saw Van Helsing break down. Heraised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair, and then beathis palms together in a helpless way; finally he sat down on a chair,and putting his hands before his face, began to sob, with loud, dry sobsthat seemed to come from the very racking of his heart. Then he raisedhis arms again, as though appealing to the whole universe. “God! God!God!” he said. “What have we done, what has this poor thing done, thatwe are so sore beset? Is there fate amongst us still, sent down from thepagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way? This poormother, all unknowing, and all for the best as she think, does suchthing as lose her daughter body and soul; and we must not tell her, wemust not even warn her, or she die, and then both die. Oh, how we arebeset! How are all the powers of the devils against us!” Suddenly hejumped to his feet. “Come,” he said, “come, we must see and act. Devilsor no devils, or all the devils at once, it matters not; we fight himall the same.” He went to the hall-door for his bag; and together wewent up to Lucy’s room.Once again I drew up the blind, whilst Van Helsing went towards the bed.This time he did not start as he looked on the poor face with the sameawful, waxen pallor as before. He wore a look of stern sadness andinfinite pity.“As I expected,” he murmured, with that hissing inspiration of his whichmeant so much. Without a word he went and locked the door, and thenbegan to set out on the little table the instruments for yet anotheroperation of transfusion of blood. I had long ago recognised thenecessity, and begun to take off my coat, but he stopped me with awarning hand. “No!” he said. “To-day you must operate. I shall provide.You are weakened already.” As he spoke he took off his coat and rolledup his shirt-sleeve.Again the operation; again the narcotic; again some return of colour tothe ashy cheeks, and the regular breathing of healthy sleep. This time Iwatched whilst Van Helsing recruited himself and rested.Presently he took an opportunity of telling Mrs. Westenra that she mustnot remove anything from Lucy’s room without consulting him; that theflowers were of medicinal value, and that the breathing of their odourwas a part of the system of cure. Then he took over the care of the casehimself, saying that he would watch this night and the next and wouldsend me word when to come.After another hour Lucy waked from her sleep, fresh and bright andseemingly not much the worse for her terrible ordeal.What does it all mean? I am beginning to wonder if my long habit of lifeamongst the insane is beginning to tell upon my own brain._Lucy Westenra’s Diary.__17 September._--Four days and nights of peace. I am getting so strongagain that I hardly know myself. It is as if I had passed through somelong nightmare, and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine andfeel the fresh air of the morning around me. I have a dimhalf-remembrance of long, anxious times of waiting and fearing; darknessin which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distressmore poignant: and then long spells of oblivion, and the rising back tolife as a diver coming up through a great press of water. Since,however, Dr. Van Helsing has been with me, all this bad dreaming seemsto have passed away; the noises that used to frighten me out of mywits--the flapping against the windows, the distant voices which seemedso close to me, the harsh sounds that came from I know not where andcommanded me to do I know not what--have all ceased. I go to bed nowwithout any fear of sleep. I do not even try to keep awake. I have grownquite fond of the garlic, and a boxful arrives for me every day fromHaarlem. To-night Dr. Van Helsing is going away, as he has to be for aday in Amsterdam. But I need not be watched; I am well enough to be leftalone. Thank God for mother’s sake, and dear Arthur’s, and for all ourfriends who have been so kind! I shall not even feel the change, forlast night Dr. Van Helsing slept in his chair a lot of the time. I foundhim asleep twice when I awoke; but I did not fear to go to sleep again,although the boughs or bats or something napped almost angrily againstthe window-panes._“The Pall Mall Gazette,” 18 September._THE ESCAPED WOLF.PERILOUS ADVENTURE OF OUR INTERVIEWER._Interview with the Keeper in the Zoölogical Gardens._After many inquiries and almost as many refusals, and perpetually usingthe words “Pall Mall Gazette” as a sort of talisman, I managed to findthe keeper of the section of the Zoölogical Gardens in which the wolfdepartment is included. Thomas Bilder lives in one of the cottages inthe enclosure behind the elephant-house, and was just sitting down tohis tea when I found him. Thomas and his wife are hospitable folk,elderly, and without children, and if the specimen I enjoyed of theirhospitality be of the average kind, their lives must be prettycomfortable. The keeper would not enter on what he called “business”until the supper was over, and we were all satisfied. Then when thetable was cleared, and he had lit his pipe, he said:--“Now, sir, you can go on and arsk me what you want. You’ll excoose merefoosin’ to talk of perfeshunal subjects afore meals. I gives thewolves and the jackals and the hyenas in all our section their tea aforeI begins to arsk them questions.”“How do you mean, ask them questions?” I queried, wishful to get himinto a talkative humour.“’Ittin’ of them over the ’ead with a pole is one way; scratchin’ oftheir hears is another, when gents as is flush wants a bit of a show-orfto their gals. I don’t so much mind the fust--the ’ittin’ with a poleafore I chucks in their dinner; but I waits till they’ve ’ad theirsherry and kawffee, so to speak, afore I tries on with theear-scratchin’. Mind you,” he added philosophically, “there’s a deal ofthe same nature in us as in them theer animiles. Here’s you a-comin’ andarskin’ of me questions about my business, and I that grumpy-like thatonly for your bloomin’ ’arf-quid I’d ’a’ seen you blowed fust ’fore I’danswer. Not even when you arsked me sarcastic-like if I’d like you toarsk the Superintendent if you might arsk me questions. Without offencedid I tell yer to go to ’ell?”“You did.”“An’ when you said you’d report me for usin’ of obscene language thatwas ’ittin’ me over the ’ead; but the ’arf-quid made that all right. Iweren’t a-goin’ to fight, so I waited for the food, and did with my ’owlas the wolves, and lions, and tigers does. But, Lor’ love yer ’art, nowthat the old ’ooman has stuck a chunk of her tea-cake in me, an’ rinsedme out with her bloomin’ old teapot, and I’ve lit hup, you may scratchmy ears for all you’re worth, and won’t git even a growl out of me.Drive along with your questions. I know what yer a-comin’ at, that ’ereescaped wolf.”“Exactly. I want you to give me your view of it. Just tell me how ithappened; and when I know the facts I’ll get you to say what youconsider was the cause of it, and how you think the whole affair willend.”“All right, guv’nor. This ’ere is about the ’ole story. That ’ere wolfwhat we called Bersicker was one of three grey ones that came fromNorway to Jamrach’s, which we bought off him four years ago. He was anice well-behaved wolf, that never gave no trouble to talk of. I’m moresurprised at ’im for wantin’ to get out nor any other animile in theplace. But, there, you can’t trust wolves no more nor women.”“Don’t you mind him, sir!” broke in Mrs. Tom, with a cheery laugh. “’E’sgot mindin’ the animiles so long that blest if he ain’t like a old wolf’isself! But there ain’t no ’arm in ’im.”“Well, sir, it was about two hours after feedin’ yesterday when I firsthear my disturbance. I was makin’ up a litter in the monkey-house for ayoung puma which is ill; but when I heard the yelpin’ and ’owlin’ I kemaway straight. There was Bersicker a-tearin’ like a mad thing at thebars as if he wanted to get out. There wasn’t much people about thatday, and close at hand was only one man, a tall, thin chap, with a ’ooknose and a pointed beard, with a few white hairs runnin’ through it. Hehad a ’ard, cold look and red eyes, and I took a sort of mislike to him,for it seemed as if it was ’im as they was hirritated at. He ’ad whitekid gloves on ’is ’ands, and he pointed out the animiles to me and says:‘Keeper, these wolves seem upset at something.’“‘Maybe it’s you,’ says I, for I did not like the airs as he give’isself. He didn’t git angry, as I ’oped he would, but he smiled a kindof insolent smile, with a mouth full of white, sharp teeth. ‘Oh no, theywouldn’t like me,’ ’e says.“‘Ow yes, they would,’ says I, a-imitatin’ of him. ‘They always likes abone or two to clean their teeth on about tea-time, which you ’as abagful.’“Well, it was a odd thing, but when the animiles see us a-talkin’ theylay down, and when I went over to Bersicker he let me stroke his earssame as ever. That there man kem over, and blessed but if he didn’t putin his hand and stroke the old wolf’s ears too!“‘Tyke care,’ says I. ‘Bersicker is quick.’“‘Never mind,’ he says. ‘I’m used to ’em!’“‘Are you in the business yourself?’ I says, tyking off my ’at, for aman what trades in wolves, anceterer, is a good friend to keepers.“‘No,’ says he, ‘not exactly in the business, but I ’ave made pets ofseveral.’ And with that he lifts his ’at as perlite as a lord, and walksaway. Old Bersicker kep’ a-lookin’ arter ’im till ’e was out of sight,and then went and lay down in a corner and wouldn’t come hout the ’olehevening. Well, larst night, so soon as the moon was hup, the wolveshere all began a-’owling. There warn’t nothing for them to ’owl at.There warn’t no one near, except some one that was evidently a-callin’ adog somewheres out back of the gardings in the Park road. Once or twiceI went out to see that all was right, and it was, and then the ’owlingstopped. Just before twelve o’clock I just took a look round aforeturnin’ in, an’, bust me, but when I kem opposite to old Bersicker’scage I see the rails broken and twisted about and the cage empty. Andthat’s all I know for certing.”“Did any one else see anything?”“One of our gard’ners was a-comin’ ’ome about that time from a ’armony,when he sees a big grey dog comin’ out through the garding ’edges. Atleast, so he says, but I don’t give much for it myself, for if he did ’enever said a word about it to his missis when ’e got ’ome, and it wasonly after the escape of the wolf was made known, and we had been up allnight-a-huntin’ of the Park for Bersicker, that he remembered seein’anything. My own belief was that the ’armony ’ad got into his ’ead.”“Now, Mr. Bilder, can you account in any way for the escape of thewolf?”“Well, sir,” he said, with a suspicious sort of modesty, “I think I can;but I don’t know as ’ow you’d be satisfied with the theory.”“Certainly I shall. If a man like you, who knows the animals fromexperience, can’t hazard a good guess at any rate, who is even to try?”“Well then, sir, I accounts for it this way; it seems to me that ’erewolf escaped--simply because he wanted to get out.”From the hearty way that both Thomas and his wife laughed at the joke Icould see that it had done service before, and that the wholeexplanation was simply an elaborate sell. I couldn’t cope in badinagewith the worthy Thomas, but I thought I knew a surer way to his heart,so I said:--“Now, Mr. Bilder, we’ll consider that first half-sovereign worked off,and this brother of his is waiting to be claimed when you’ve told mewhat you think will happen.”“Right y’are, sir,” he said briskly. “Ye’ll excoose me, I know, fora-chaffin’ of ye, but the old woman here winked at me, which was as muchas telling me to go on.”“Well, I never!” said the old lady.“My opinion is this: that ’ere wolf is a-’idin’ of, somewheres. Thegard’ner wot didn’t remember said he was a-gallopin’ northward fasterthan a horse could go; but I don’t believe him, for, yer see, sir,wolves don’t gallop no more nor dogs does, they not bein’ built thatway. Wolves is fine things in a storybook, and I dessay when they getsin packs and does be chivyin’ somethin’ that’s more afeared than they isthey can make a devil of a noise and chop it up, whatever it is. But,Lor’ bless you, in real life a wolf is only a low creature, not half soclever or bold as a good dog; and not half a quarter so much fight in’im. This one ain’t been used to fightin’ or even to providin’ forhisself, and more like he’s somewhere round the Park a-’idin’ an’a-shiverin’ of, and, if he thinks at all, wonderin’ where he is to gethis breakfast from; or maybe he’s got down some area and is in acoal-cellar. My eye, won’t some cook get a rum start when she sees hisgreen eyes a-shining at her out of the dark! If he can’t get food he’sbound to look for it, and mayhap he may chance to light on a butcher’sshop in time. If he doesn’t, and some nursemaid goes a-walkin’ orf witha soldier, leavin’ of the hinfant in the perambulator--well, then Ishouldn’t be surprised if the census is one babby the less. That’sall.”I was handing him the half-sovereign, when something came bobbing upagainst the window, and Mr. Bilder’s face doubled its natural lengthwith surprise.“God bless me!” he said. “If there ain’t old Bersicker come back by’isself!”He went to the door and opened it; a most unnecessary proceeding itseemed to me. I have always thought that a wild animal never looks sowell as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between us; apersonal experience has intensified rather than diminished that idea.After all, however, there is nothing like custom, for neither Bilder norhis wife thought any more of the wolf than I should of a dog. The animalitself was as peaceful and well-behaved as that father of allpicture-wolves--Red Riding Hood’s quondam friend, whilst moving herconfidence in masquerade.The whole scene was an unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos. Thewicked wolf that for half a day had paralysed London and set all thechildren in the town shivering in their shoes, was there in a sort ofpenitent mood, and was received and petted like a sort of vulpineprodigal son. Old Bilder examined him all over with most tendersolicitude, and when he had finished with his penitent said:--“There, I knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of trouble;didn’t I say it all along? Here’s his head all cut and full of brokenglass. ’E’s been a-gettin’ over some bloomin’ wall or other. It’s ashyme that people are allowed to top their walls with broken bottles.This ’ere’s what comes of it. Come along, Bersicker.”He took the wolf and locked him up in a cage, with a piece of meat thatsatisfied, in quantity at any rate, the elementary conditions of thefatted calf, and went off to report.I came off, too, to report the only exclusive information that is givento-day regarding the strange escapade at the Zoo._Dr. Seward’s Diary.__17 September._--I was engaged after dinner in my study posting up mybooks, which, through press of other work and the many visits to Lucy,had fallen sadly into arrear. Suddenly the door was burst open, and inrushed my patient, with his face distorted with passion. I wasthunderstruck, for such a thing as a patient getting of his own accordinto the Superintendent’s study is almost unknown. Without an instant’spause he made straight at me. He had a dinner-knife in his hand, and,as I saw he was dangerous, I tried to keep the table between us. He wastoo quick and too strong for me, however; for before I could get mybalance he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely.Before he could strike again, however, I got in my right and he wassprawling on his back on the floor. My wrist bled freely, and quite alittle pool trickled on to the carpet. I saw that my friend was notintent on further effort, and occupied myself binding up my wrist,keeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time. When theattendants rushed in, and we turned our attention to him, his employmentpositively sickened me. He was lying on his belly on the floor lickingup, like a dog, the blood which had fallen from my wounded wrist. He waseasily secured, and, to my surprise, went with the attendants quiteplacidly, simply repeating over and over again: “The blood is the life!The blood is the life!”I cannot afford to lose blood just at present; I have lost too much oflate for my physical good, and then the prolonged strain of Lucy’sillness and its horrible phases is telling on me. I am over-excited andweary, and I need rest, rest, rest. Happily Van Helsing has not summonedme, so I need not forego my sleep; to-night I could not well do withoutit._Telegram, Van Helsing, Antwerp, to Seward, Carfax._(Sent to Carfax, Sussex, as no county given; delivered late bytwenty-two hours.)“_17 September._--Do not fail to be at Hillingham to-night. If notwatching all the time frequently, visit and see that flowers are asplaced; very important; do not fail. Shall be with you as soon aspossible after arrival.”_Dr. Seward’s Diary.__18 September._--Just off for train to London. The arrival of VanHelsing’s telegram filled me with dismay. A whole night lost, and I knowby bitter experience what may happen in a night. Of course it ispossible that all may be well, but what _may_ have happened? Surelythere is some horrible doom hanging over us that every possible accidentshould thwart us in all we try to do. I shall take this cylinder withme, and then I can complete my entry on Lucy’s phonograph._Memorandum left by Lucy Westenra.__17 September. Night._--I write this and leave it to be seen, so that noone may by any chance get into trouble through me. This is an exactrecord of what took place to-night. I feel I am dying of weakness, andhave barely strength to write, but it must be done if I die in thedoing.I went to bed as usual, taking care that the flowers were placed as Dr.Van Helsing directed, and soon fell asleep.I was waked by the flapping at the window, which had begun after thatsleep-walking on the cliff at Whitby when Mina saved me, and which now Iknow so well. I was not afraid, but I did wish that Dr. Seward was inthe next room--as Dr. Van Helsing said he would be--so that I might havecalled him. I tried to go to sleep, but could not. Then there came to methe old fear of sleep, and I determined to keep awake. Perversely sleepwould try to come then when I did not want it; so, as I feared to bealone, I opened my door and called out: “Is there anybody there?” Therewas no answer. I was afraid to wake mother, and so closed my door again.Then outside in the shrubbery I heard a sort of howl like a dog’s, butmore fierce and deeper. I went to the window and looked out, but couldsee nothing, except a big bat, which had evidently been buffeting itswings against the window. So I went back to bed again, but determinednot to go to sleep. Presently the door opened, and mother looked in;seeing by my moving that I was not asleep, came in, and sat by me. Shesaid to me even more sweetly and softly than her wont:--“I was uneasy about you, darling, and came in to see that you were allright.”I feared she might catch cold sitting there, and asked her to come inand sleep with me, so she came into bed, and lay down beside me; she didnot take off her dressing gown, for she said she would only stay a whileand then go back to her own bed. As she lay there in my arms, and I inhers, the flapping and buffeting came to the window again. She wasstartled and a little frightened, and cried out: “What is that?” I triedto pacify her, and at last succeeded, and she lay quiet; but I couldhear her poor dear heart still beating terribly. After a while there wasthe low howl again out in the shrubbery, and shortly after there was acrash at the window, and a lot of broken glass was hurled on the floor.The window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in, and in theaperture of the broken panes there was the head of a great, gaunt greywolf. Mother cried out in a fright, and struggled up into a sittingposture, and clutched wildly at anything that would help her. Amongstother things, she clutched the wreath of flowers that Dr. Van Helsinginsisted on my wearing round my neck, and tore it away from me. For asecond or two she sat up, pointing at the wolf, and there was a strangeand horrible gurgling in her throat; then she fell over--as if struckwith lightning, and her head hit my forehead and made me dizzy for amoment or two. The room and all round seemed to spin round. I kept myeyes fixed on the window, but the wolf drew his head back, and a wholemyriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the brokenwindow, and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust thattravellers describe when there is a simoon in the desert. I tried tostir, but there was some spell upon me, and dear mother’s poor body,which seemed to grow cold already--for her dear heart had ceased tobeat--weighed me down; and I remembered no more for a while.The time did not seem long, but very, very awful, till I recoveredconsciousness again. Somewhere near, a passing bell was tolling; thedogs all round the neighbourhood were howling; and in our shrubbery,seemingly just outside, a nightingale was singing. I was dazed andstupid with pain and terror and weakness, but the sound of thenightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfortme. The sounds seemed to have awakened the maids, too, for I could heartheir bare feet pattering outside my door. I called to them, and theycame in, and when they saw what had happened, and what it was that layover me on the bed, they screamed out. The wind rushed in through thebroken window, and the door slammed to. They lifted off the body of mydear mother, and laid her, covered up with a sheet, on the bed after Ihad got up. They were all so frightened and nervous that I directed themto go to the dining-room and have each a glass of wine. The door flewopen for an instant and closed again. The maids shrieked, and then wentin a body to the dining-room; and I laid what flowers I had on my dearmother’s breast. When they were there I remembered what Dr. Van Helsinghad told me, but I didn’t like to remove them, and, besides, I wouldhave some of the servants to sit up with me now. I was surprised thatthe maids did not come back. I called them, but got no answer, so I wentto the dining-room to look for them.My heart sank when I saw what had happened. They all four lay helplesson the floor, breathing heavily. The decanter of sherry was on the tablehalf full, but there was a queer, acrid smell about. I was suspicious,and examined the decanter. It smelt of laudanum, and looking on thesideboard, I found that the bottle which mother’s doctor uses forher--oh! did use--was empty. What am I to do? what am I to do? I am backin the room with mother. I cannot leave her, and I am alone, save forthe sleeping servants, whom some one has drugged. Alone with the dead! Idare not go out, for I can hear the low howl of the wolf through thebroken window.The air seems full of specks, floating and circling in the draught fromthe window, and the lights burn blue and dim. What am I to do? Godshield me from harm this night! I shall hide this paper in my breast,where they shall find it when they come to lay me out. My dear mothergone! It is time that I go too. Good-bye, dear Arthur, if I should notsurvive this night. God keep you, dear, and God help me!CHAPTER XIIDR. SEWARD’S DIARY_18 September._--I drove at once to Hillingham and arrived early.Keeping my cab at the gate, I went up the avenue alone. I knocked gentlyand rang as quietly as possible, for I feared to disturb Lucy or hermother, and hoped to only bring a servant to the door. After a while,finding no response, I knocked and rang again; still no answer. I cursedthe laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such anhour--for it was now ten o’clock--and so rang and knocked again, butmore impatiently, but still without response. Hitherto I had blamed onlythe servants, but now a terrible fear began to assail me. Was thisdesolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawingtight around us? Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come, toolate? I knew that minutes, even seconds of delay, might mean hours ofdanger to Lucy, if she had had again one of those frightful relapses;and I went round the house to try if I could find by chance an entryanywhere.I could find no means of ingress. Every window and door was fastened andlocked, and I returned baffled to the porch. As I did so, I heard therapid pit-pat of a swiftly driven horse’s feet. They stopped at thegate, and a few seconds later I met Van Helsing running up the avenue.When he saw me, he gasped out:--“Then it was you, and just arrived. How is she? Are we too late? Did younot get my telegram?”I answered as quickly and coherently as I could that I had only got histelegram early in the morning, and had not lost a minute in coming here,and that I could not make any one in the house hear me. He paused andraised his hat as he said solemnly:--“Then I fear we are too late. God’s will be done!” With his usualrecuperative energy, he went on: “Come. If there be no way open to getin, we must make one. Time is all in all to us now.”We went round to the back of the house, where there was a kitchenwindow. The Professor took a small surgical saw from his case, andhanding it to me, pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window. Iattacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them. Thenwith a long, thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes andopened the window. I helped the Professor in, and followed him. Therewas no one in the kitchen or in the servants’ rooms, which were close athand. We tried all the rooms as we went along, and in the dining-room,dimly lit by rays of light through the shutters, found fourservant-women lying on the floor. There was no need to think them dead,for their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in theroom left no doubt as to their condition. Van Helsing and I looked ateach other, and as we moved away he said: “We can attend to them later.”Then we ascended to Lucy’s room. For an instant or two we paused at thedoor to listen, but there was no sound that we could hear. With whitefaces and trembling hands, we opened the door gently, and entered theroom.How shall I describe what we saw? On the bed lay two women, Lucy and hermother. The latter lay farthest in, and she was covered with a whitesheet, the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through thebroken window, showing the drawn, white face, with a look of terrorfixed upon it. By her side lay Lucy, with face white and still moredrawn. The flowers which had been round her neck we found upon hermother’s bosom, and her throat was bare, showing the two little woundswhich we had noticed before, but looking horribly white and mangled.Without a word the Professor bent over the bed, his head almost touchingpoor Lucy’s breast; then he gave a quick turn of his head, as of one wholistens, and leaping to his feet, he cried out to me:--“It is not yet too late! Quick! quick! Bring the brandy!”I flew downstairs and returned with it, taking care to smell and tasteit, lest it, too, were drugged like the decanter of sherry which I foundon the table. The maids were still breathing, but more restlessly, and Ifancied that the narcotic was wearing off. I did not stay to make sure,but returned to Van Helsing. He rubbed the brandy, as on anotheroccasion, on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the palms of herhands. He said to me:--“I can do this, all that can be at the present. You go wake those maids.Flick them in the face with a wet towel, and flick them hard. Make themget heat and fire and a warm bath. This poor soul is nearly as cold asthat beside her. She will need be heated before we can do anythingmore.”I went at once, and found little difficulty in waking three of thewomen. The fourth was only a young girl, and the drug had evidentlyaffected her more strongly, so I lifted her on the sofa and let hersleep. The others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came back tothem they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner. I was stern withthem, however, and would not let them talk. I told them that one lifewas bad enough to lose, and that if they delayed they would sacrificeMiss Lucy. So, sobbing and crying, they went about their way, half cladas they were, and prepared fire and water. Fortunately, the kitchen andboiler fires were still alive, and there was no lack of hot water. Wegot a bath and carried Lucy out as she was and placed her in it. Whilstwe were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door. Oneof the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and opened it. Thenshe returned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had comewith a message from Mr. Holmwood. I bade her simply tell him that hemust wait, for we could see no one now. She went away with the message,and, engrossed with our work, I clean forgot all about him.I never saw in all my experience the Professor work in such deadlyearnest. I knew--as he knew--that it was a stand-up fight with death,and in a pause told him so. He answered me in a way that I did notunderstand, but with the sternest look that his face could wear:--“If that were all, I would stop here where we are now, and let her fadeaway into peace, for I see no light in life over her horizon.” He wenton with his work with, if possible, renewed and more frenzied vigour.Presently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning tobe of some effect. Lucy’s heart beat a trifle more audibly to thestethoscope, and her lungs had a perceptible movement. Van Helsing’sface almost beamed, and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her ina hot sheet to dry her he said to me:--“The first gain is ours! Check to the King!”We took Lucy into another room, which had by now been prepared, and laidher in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat. I noticedthat Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat. She wasstill unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we hadever seen her.Van Helsing called in one of the women, and told her to stay with herand not to take her eyes off her till we returned, and then beckoned meout of the room.“We must consult as to what is to be done,” he said as we descended thestairs. In the hall he opened the dining-room door, and we passed in, heclosing the door carefully behind him. The shutters had been opened, butthe blinds were already down, with that obedience to the etiquette ofdeath which the British woman of the lower classes always rigidlyobserves. The room was, therefore, dimly dark. It was, however, lightenough for our purposes. Van Helsing’s sternness was somewhat relievedby a look of perplexity. He was evidently torturing his mind aboutsomething, so I waited for an instant, and he spoke:--“What are we to do now? Where are we to turn for help? We must haveanother transfusion of blood, and that soon, or that poor girl’s lifewon’t be worth an hour’s purchase. You are exhausted already; I amexhausted too. I fear to trust those women, even if they would havecourage to submit. What are we to do for some one who will open hisveins for her?”“What’s the matter with me, anyhow?”The voice came from the sofa across the room, and its tones broughtrelief and joy to my heart, for they were those of Quincey Morris. VanHelsing started angrily at the first sound, but his face softened and aglad look came into his eyes as I cried out: “Quincey Morris!” andrushed towards him with outstretched hands.“What brought you here?” I cried as our hands met.“I guess Art is the cause.”He handed me a telegram:--“Have not heard from Seward for three days, and am terribly anxious.Cannot leave. Father still in same condition. Send me word how Lucy is.Do not delay.--HOLMWOOD.”“I think I came just in the nick of time. You know you have only to tellme what to do.”Van Helsing strode forward, and took his hand, looking him straight inthe eyes as he said:--“A brave man’s blood is the best thing on this earth when a woman is introuble. You’re a man and no mistake. Well, the devil may work againstus for all he’s worth, but God sends us men when we want them.”Once again we went through that ghastly operation. I have not the heartto go through with the details. Lucy had got a terrible shock and ittold on her more than before, for though plenty of blood went into herveins, her body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the otheroccasions. Her struggle back into life was something frightful to seeand hear. However, the action of both heart and lungs improved, and VanHelsing made a subcutaneous injection of morphia, as before, and withgood effect. Her faint became a profound slumber. The Professor watchedwhilst I went downstairs with Quincey Morris, and sent one of the maidsto pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting. I left Quincey lying downafter having a glass of wine, and told the cook to get ready a goodbreakfast. Then a thought struck me, and I went back to the room whereLucy now was. When I came softly in, I found Van Helsing with a sheet ortwo of note-paper in his hand. He had evidently read it, and wasthinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow. There was a lookof grim satisfaction in his face, as of one who has had a doubt solved.He handed me the paper saying only: “It dropped from Lucy’s breast whenwe carried her to the bath.”When I had read it, I stood looking at the Professor, and after a pauseasked him: “In God’s name, what does it all mean? Was she, or is she,mad; or what sort of horrible danger is it?” I was so bewildered that Idid not know what to say more. Van Helsing put out his hand and took thepaper, saying:--“Do not trouble about it now. Forget it for the present. You shall knowand understand it all in good time; but it will be later. And now whatis it that you came to me to say?” This brought me back to fact, and Iwas all myself again.“I came to speak about the certificate of death. If we do not actproperly and wisely, there may be an inquest, and that paper would haveto be produced. I am in hopes that we need have no inquest, for if wehad it would surely kill poor Lucy, if nothing else did. I know, and youknow, and the other doctor who attended her knows, that Mrs. Westenrahad disease of the heart, and we can certify that she died of it. Let usfill up the certificate at once, and I shall take it myself to theregistrar and go on to the undertaker.”“Good, oh my friend John! Well thought of! Truly Miss Lucy, if she besad in the foes that beset her, is at least happy in the friends thatlove her. One, two, three, all open their veins for her, besides one oldman. Ah yes, I know, friend John; I am not blind! I love you all themore for it! Now go.”In the hall I met Quincey Morris, with a telegram for Arthur telling himthat Mrs. Westenra was dead; that Lucy also had been ill, but was nowgoing on better; and that Van Helsing and I were with her. I told himwhere I was going, and he hurried me out, but as I was going said:--“When you come back, Jack, may I have two words with you all toourselves?” I nodded in reply and went out. I found no difficulty aboutthe registration, and arranged with the local undertaker to come up inthe evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements.When I got back Quincey was waiting for me. I told him I would see himas soon as I knew about Lucy, and went up to her room. She was stillsleeping, and the Professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at herside. From his putting his finger to his lips, I gathered that heexpected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature.So I went down to Quincey and took him into the breakfast-room, wherethe blinds were not drawn down, and which was a little more cheerful, orrather less cheerless, than the other rooms. When we were alone, he saidto me:--“Jack Seward, I don’t want to shove myself in anywhere where I’ve noright to be; but this is no ordinary case. You know I loved that girland wanted to marry her; but, although that’s all past and gone, I can’thelp feeling anxious about her all the same. What is it that’s wrongwith her? The Dutchman--and a fine old fellow he is; I can seethat--said, that time you two came into the room, that you must have_another_ transfusion of blood, and that both you and he were exhausted.Now I know well that you medical men speak _in camera_, and that a manmust not expect to know what they consult about in private. But this isno common matter, and, whatever it is, I have done my part. Is not thatso?”“That’s so,” I said, and he went on:--“I take it that both you and Van Helsing had done already what I didto-day. Is not that so?”“That’s so.”“And I guess Art was in it too. When I saw him four days ago down at hisown place he looked queer. I have not seen anything pulled down so quicksince I was on the Pampas and had a mare that I was fond of go to grassall in a night. One of those big bats that they call vampires had got ather in the night, and what with his gorge and the vein left open, therewasn’t enough blood in her to let her stand up, and I had to put abullet through her as she lay. Jack, if you may tell me withoutbetraying confidence, Arthur was the first, is not that so?” As he spokethe poor fellow looked terribly anxious. He was in a torture of suspenseregarding the woman he loved, and his utter ignorance of the terriblemystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain. His veryheart was bleeding, and it took all the manhood of him--and there was aroyal lot of it, too--to keep him from breaking down. I paused beforeanswering, for I felt that I must not betray anything which theProfessor wished kept secret; but already he knew so much, and guessedso much, that there could be no reason for not answering, so I answeredin the same phrase: “That’s so.”“And how long has this been going on?”“About ten days.”“Ten days! Then I guess, Jack Seward, that that poor pretty creaturethat we all love has had put into her veins within that time the bloodof four strong men. Man alive, her whole body wouldn’t hold it.” Then,coming close to me, he spoke in a fierce half-whisper: “What took itout?”I shook my head. “That,” I said, “is the crux. Van Helsing is simplyfrantic about it, and I am at my wits’ end. I can’t even hazard a guess.There has been a series of little circumstances which have thrown outall our calculations as to Lucy being properly watched. But these shallnot occur again. Here we stay until all be well--or ill.” Quincey heldout his hand. “Count me in,” he said. “You and the Dutchman will tell mewhat to do, and I’ll do it.”When she woke late in the afternoon, Lucy’s first movement was to feelin her breast, and, to my surprise, produced the paper which Van Helsinghad given me to read. The careful Professor had replaced it where it hadcome from, lest on waking she should be alarmed. Her eye then lit on VanHelsing and on me too, and gladdened. Then she looked around the room,and seeing where she was, shuddered; she gave a loud cry, and put herpoor thin hands before her pale face. We both understood what thatmeant--that she had realised to the full her mother’s death; so we triedwhat we could to comfort her. Doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat, butshe was very low in thought and spirit, and wept silently and weakly fora long time. We told her that either or both of us would now remain withher all the time, and that seemed to comfort her. Towards dusk she fellinto a doze. Here a very odd thing occurred. Whilst still asleep shetook the paper from her breast and tore it in two. Van Helsing steppedover and took the pieces from her. All the same, however, she went onwith the action of tearing, as though the material were still in herhands; finally she lifted her hands and opened them as though scatteringthe fragments. Van Helsing seemed surprised, and his brows gathered asif in thought, but he said nothing.*       *       *       *       *_19 September._--All last night she slept fitfully, being always afraidto sleep, and something weaker when she woke from it. The Professor andI took it in turns to watch, and we never left her for a momentunattended. Quincey Morris said nothing about his intention, but I knewthat all night long he patrolled round and round the house.When the day came, its searching light showed the ravages in poor Lucy’sstrength. She was hardly able to turn her head, and the littlenourishment which she could take seemed to do her no good. At times sheslept, and both Van Helsing and I noticed the difference in her, betweensleeping and waking. Whilst asleep she looked stronger, although morehaggard, and her breathing was softer; her open mouth showed the palegums drawn back from the teeth, which thus looked positively longer andsharper than usual; when she woke the softness of her eyes evidentlychanged the expression, for she looked her own self, although a dyingone. In the afternoon she asked for Arthur, and we telegraphed for him.Quincey went off to meet him at the station.When he arrived it was nearly six o’clock, and the sun was setting fulland warm, and the red light streamed in through the window and gave morecolour to the pale cheeks. When he saw her, Arthur was simply chokingwith emotion, and none of us could speak. In the hours that had passed,the fits of sleep, or the comatose condition that passed for it, hadgrown more frequent, so that the pauses when conversation was possiblewere shortened. Arthur’s presence, however, seemed to act as astimulant; she rallied a little, and spoke to him more brightly than shehad done since we arrived. He too pulled himself together, and spoke ascheerily as he could, so that the best was made of everything.It was now nearly one o’clock, and he and Van Helsing are sitting withher. I am to relieve them in a quarter of an hour, and I am enteringthis on Lucy’s phonograph. Until six o’clock they are to try to rest. Ifear that to-morrow will end our watching, for the shock has been toogreat; the poor child cannot rally. God help us all._Letter, Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra._(Unopened by her.)“_17 September._“My dearest Lucy,--“It seems _an age_ since I heard from you, or indeed since I wrote. Youwill pardon me, I know, for all my faults when you have read all mybudget of news. Well, I got my husband back all right; when we arrivedat Exeter there was a carriage waiting for us, and in it, though he hadan attack of gout, Mr. Hawkins. He took us to his house, where therewere rooms for us all nice and comfortable, and we dined together. Afterdinner Mr. Hawkins said:--“‘My dears, I want to drink your health and prosperity; and may everyblessing attend you both. I know you both from children, and have, withlove and pride, seen you grow up. Now I want you to make your home herewith me. I have left to me neither chick nor child; all are gone, and inmy will I have left you everything.’ I cried, Lucy dear, as Jonathan andthe old man clasped hands. Our evening was a very, very happy one.“So here we are, installed in this beautiful old house, and from both mybedroom and the drawing-room I can see the great elms of the cathedralclose, with their great black stems standing out against the old yellowstone of the cathedral and I can hear the rooks overhead cawing andcawing and chattering and gossiping all day, after the manner ofrooks--and humans. I am busy, I need not tell you, arranging things andhousekeeping. Jonathan and Mr. Hawkins are busy all day; for, now thatJonathan is a partner, Mr. Hawkins wants to tell him all about theclients.“How is your dear mother getting on? I wish I could run up to town for aday or two to see you, dear, but I dare not go yet, with so much on myshoulders; and Jonathan wants looking after still. He is beginning toput some flesh on his bones again, but he was terribly weakened by thelong illness; even now he sometimes starts out of his sleep in a suddenway and awakes all trembling until I can coax him back to his usualplacidity. However, thank God, these occasions grow less frequent as thedays go on, and they will in time pass away altogether, I trust. And nowI have told you my news, let me ask yours. When are you to be married,and where, and who is to perform the ceremony, and what are you to wear,and is it to be a public or a private wedding? Tell me all about it,dear; tell me all about everything, for there is nothing which interestsyou which will not be dear to me. Jonathan asks me to send his‘respectful duty,’ but I do not think that is good enough from thejunior partner of the important firm Hawkins & Harker; and so, as youlove me, and he loves me, and I love you with all the moods and tensesof the verb, I send you simply his ‘love’ instead. Good-bye, my dearestLucy, and all blessings on you.“Yours,“MINA HARKER.”_Report from Patrick Hennessey, M. D., M. R. C. S. L. K. Q. C. P. I.,etc., etc., to John Seward, M. D._“_20 September._“My dear Sir,--“In accordance with your wishes, I enclose report of the conditions ofeverything left in my charge.... With regard to patient, Renfield, thereis more to say. He has had another outbreak, which might have had adreadful ending, but which, as it fortunately happened, was unattendedwith any unhappy results. This afternoon a carrier’s cart with two menmade a call at the empty house whose grounds abut on ours--the house towhich, you will remember, the patient twice ran away. The men stopped atour gate to ask the porter their way, as they were strangers. I wasmyself looking out of the study window, having a smoke after dinner, andsaw one of them come up to the house. As he passed the window ofRenfield’s room, the patient began to rate him from within, and calledhim all the foul names he could lay his tongue to. The man, who seemed adecent fellow enough, contented himself by telling him to “shut up for afoul-mouthed beggar,” whereon our man accused him of robbing him andwanting to murder him and said that he would hinder him if he were toswing for it. I opened the window and signed to the man not to notice,so he contented himself after looking the place over and making up hismind as to what kind of a place he had got to by saying: ‘Lor’ blessyer, sir, I wouldn’t mind what was said to me in a bloomin’ madhouse. Ipity ye and the guv’nor for havin’ to live in the house with a wildbeast like that.’ Then he asked his way civilly enough, and I told himwhere the gate of the empty house was; he went away, followed by threatsand curses and revilings from our man. I went down to see if I couldmake out any cause for his anger, since he is usually such awell-behaved man, and except his violent fits nothing of the kind hadever occurred. I found him, to my astonishment, quite composed and mostgenial in his manner. I tried to get him to talk of the incident, but heblandly asked me questions as to what I meant, and led me to believethat he was completely oblivious of the affair. It was, I am sorry tosay, however, only another instance of his cunning, for within half anhour I heard of him again. This time he had broken out through thewindow of his room, and was running down the avenue. I called to theattendants to follow me, and ran after him, for I feared he was intenton some mischief. My fear was justified when I saw the same cart whichhad passed before coming down the road, having on it some great woodenboxes. The men were wiping their foreheads, and were flushed in theface, as if with violent exercise. Before I could get up to him thepatient rushed at them, and pulling one of them off the cart, began toknock his head against the ground. If I had not seized him just at themoment I believe he would have killed the man there and then. The otherfellow jumped down and struck him over the head with the butt-end of hisheavy whip. It was a terrible blow; but he did not seem to mind it, butseized him also, and struggled with the three of us, pulling us to andfro as if we were kittens. You know I am no light weight, and the otherswere both burly men. At first he was silent in his fighting; but as webegan to master him, and the attendants were putting a strait-waistcoaton him, he began to shout: ‘I’ll frustrate them! They shan’t rob me!they shan’t murder me by inches! I’ll fight for my Lord and Master!’ andall sorts of similar incoherent ravings. It was with very considerabledifficulty that they got him back to the house and put him in the paddedroom. One of the attendants, Hardy, had a finger broken. However, I setit all right; and he is going on well.“The two carriers were at first loud in their threats of actions fordamages, and promised to rain all the penalties of the law on us. Theirthreats were, however, mingled with some sort of indirect apology forthe defeat of the two of them by a feeble madman. They said that if ithad not been for the way their strength had been spent in carrying andraising the heavy boxes to the cart they would have made short work ofhim. They gave as another reason for their defeat the extraordinarystate of drouth to which they had been reduced by the dusty nature oftheir occupation and the reprehensible distance from the scene of theirlabours of any place of public entertainment. I quite understood theirdrift, and after a stiff glass of grog, or rather more of the same, andwith each a sovereign in hand, they made light of the attack, and sworethat they would encounter a worse madman any day for the pleasure ofmeeting so ‘bloomin’ good a bloke’ as your correspondent. I took theirnames and addresses, in case they might be needed. They are asfollows:--Jack Smollet, of Dudding’s Rents, King George’s Road, GreatWalworth, and Thomas Snelling, Peter Farley’s Row, Guide Court, BethnalGreen. They are both in the employment of Harris & Sons, Moving andShipment Company, Orange Master’s Yard, Soho.“I shall report to you any matter of interest occurring here, and shallwire you at once if there is anything of importance.“Believe me, dear Sir,“Yours faithfully,“PATRICK HENNESSEY.”_Letter, Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra_.(Unopened by her.)“_18 September._“My dearest Lucy,--“Such a sad blow has befallen us. Mr. Hawkins has died very suddenly.Some may not think it so sad for us, but we had both come to so love himthat it really seems as though we had lost a father. I never knew eitherfather or mother, so that the dear old man’s death is a real blow to me.Jonathan is greatly distressed. It is not only that he feels sorrow,deep sorrow, for the dear, good man who has befriended him all his life,and now at the end has treated him like his own son and left him afortune which to people of our modest bringing up is wealth beyond thedream of avarice, but Jonathan feels it on another account. He says theamount of responsibility which it puts upon him makes him nervous. Hebegins to doubt himself. I try to cheer him up, and _my_ belief in _him_helps him to have a belief in himself. But it is here that the graveshock that he experienced tells upon him the most. Oh, it is too hardthat a sweet, simple, noble, strong nature such as his--a nature whichenabled him by our dear, good friend’s aid to rise from clerk to masterin a few years--should be so injured that the very essence of itsstrength is gone. Forgive me, dear, if I worry you with my troubles inthe midst of your own happiness; but, Lucy dear, I must tell some one,for the strain of keeping up a brave and cheerful appearance to Jonathantries me, and I have no one here that I can confide in. I dread comingup to London, as we must do the day after to-morrow; for poor Mr.Hawkins left in his will that he was to be buried in the grave with hisfather. As there are no relations at all, Jonathan will have to be chiefmourner. I shall try to run over to see you, dearest, if only for a fewminutes. Forgive me for troubling you. With all blessings,“Your loving“MINA HARKER.”_Dr. Seward’s Diary.__20 September._--Only resolution and habit can let me make an entryto-night. I am too miserable, too low-spirited, too sick of the worldand all in it, including life itself, that I would not care if I heardthis moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death. And he hasbeen flapping those grim wings to some purpose of late--Lucy’s motherand Arthur’s father, and now.... Let me get on with my work.I duly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over Lucy. We wanted Arthur togo to rest also, but he refused at first. It was only when I told himthat we should want him to help us during the day, and that we must notall break down for want of rest, lest Lucy should suffer, that he agreedto go. Van Helsing was very kind to him. “Come, my child,” he said;“come with me. You are sick and weak, and have had much sorrow and muchmental pain, as well as that tax on your strength that we know of. Youmust not be alone; for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms.Come to the drawing-room, where there is a big fire, and there are twosofas. You shall lie on one, and I on the other, and our sympathy willbe comfort to each other, even though we do not speak, and even if wesleep.” Arthur went off with him, casting back a longing look on Lucy’sface, which lay in her pillow, almost whiter than the lawn. She layquite still, and I looked round the room to see that all was as itshould be. I could see that the Professor had carried out in this room,as in the other, his purpose of using the garlic; the whole of thewindow-sashes reeked with it, and round Lucy’s neck, over the silkhandkerchief which Van Helsing made her keep on, was a rough chaplet ofthe same odorous flowers. Lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously, andher face was at its worst, for the open mouth showed the pale gums. Herteeth, in the dim, uncertain light, seemed longer and sharper than theyhad been in the morning. In particular, by some trick of the light, thecanine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest. I sat down by her,and presently she moved uneasily. At the same moment there came a sortof dull flapping or buffeting at the window. I went over to it softly,and peeped out by the corner of the blind. There was a full moonlight,and I could see that the noise was made by a great bat, which wheeledround--doubtless attracted by the light, although so dim--and every nowand again struck the window with its wings. When I came back to my seat,I found that Lucy had moved slightly, and had torn away the garlicflowers from her throat. I replaced them as well as I could, and satwatching her.Presently she woke, and I gave her food, as Van Helsing had prescribed.She took but a little, and that languidly. There did not seem to be withher now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hithertoso marked her illness. It struck me as curious that the moment shebecame conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her. It wascertainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state, with thestertorous breathing, she put the flowers from her; but that when shewaked she clutched them close. There was no possibility of making anymistake about this, for in the long hours that followed, she had manyspells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times.At six o’clock Van Helsing came to relieve me. Arthur had then falleninto a doze, and he mercifully let him sleep on. When he saw Lucy’s faceI could hear the sissing indraw of his breath, and he said to me in asharp whisper: “Draw up the blind; I want light!” Then he bent down,and, with his face almost touching Lucy’s, examined her carefully. Heremoved the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat. Ashe did so he started back, and I could hear his ejaculation, “MeinGott!” as it was smothered in his throat. I bent over and looked, too,and as I noticed some queer chill came over me.The wounds on the throat had absolutely disappeared.For fully five minutes Van Helsing stood looking at her, with his faceat its sternest. Then he turned to me and said calmly:--“She is dying. It will not be long now. It will be much difference, markme, whether she dies conscious or in her sleep. Wake that poor boy, andlet him come and see the last; he trusts us, and we have promised him.”I went to the dining-room and waked him. He was dazed for a moment, butwhen he saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges of the shuttershe thought he was late, and expressed his fear. I assured him that Lucywas still asleep, but told him as gently as I could that both VanHelsing and I feared that the end was near. He covered his face with hishands, and slid down on his knees by the sofa, where he remained,perhaps a minute, with his head buried, praying, whilst his shouldersshook with grief. I took him by the hand and raised him up. “Come,” Isaid, “my dear old fellow, summon all your fortitude: it will be bestand easiest for her.”When we came into Lucy’s room I could see that Van Helsing had, withhis usual forethought, been putting matters straight and makingeverything look as pleasing as possible. He had even brushed Lucy’shair, so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples. When wecame into the room she opened her eyes, and seeing him, whisperedsoftly:--“Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come!” He was stooping tokiss her, when Van Helsing motioned him back. “No,” he whispered, “notyet! Hold her hand; it will comfort her more.”So Arthur took her hand and knelt beside her, and she looked her best,with all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes. Thengradually her eyes closed, and she sank to sleep. For a little bit herbreast heaved softly, and her breath came and went like a tired child’s.And then insensibly there came the strange change which I had noticed inthe night. Her breathing grew stertorous, the mouth opened, and the palegums, drawn back, made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever. In asort of sleep-waking, vague, unconscious way she opened her eyes, whichwere now dull and hard at once, and said in a soft, voluptuous voice,such as I had never heard from her lips:--“Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come! Kiss me!” Arthur benteagerly over to kiss her; but at that instant Van Helsing, who, like me,had been startled by her voice, swooped upon him, and catching him bythe neck with both hands, dragged him back with a fury of strength whichI never thought he could have possessed, and actually hurled him almostacross the room.“Not for your life!” he said; “not for your living soul and hers!” Andhe stood between them like a lion at bay.Arthur was so taken aback that he did not for a moment know what to door say; and before any impulse of violence could seize him he realisedthe place and the occasion, and stood silent, waiting.I kept my eyes fixed on Lucy, as did Van Helsing, and we saw a spasm asof rage flit like a shadow over her face; the sharp teeth champedtogether. Then her eyes closed, and she breathed heavily.Very shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness, andputting out her poor, pale, thin hand, took Van Helsing’s great brownone; drawing it to her, she kissed it. “My true friend,” she said, in afaint voice, but with untellable pathos, “My true friend, and his! Oh,guard him, and give me peace!”“I swear it!” he said solemnly, kneeling beside her and holding up hishand, as one who registers an oath. Then he turned to Arthur, and saidto him: “Come, my child, take her hand in yours, and kiss her on theforehead, and only once.”Their eyes met instead of their lips; and so they parted.Lucy’s eyes closed; and Van Helsing, who had been watching closely, tookArthur’s arm, and drew him away.And then Lucy’s breathing became stertorous again, and all at once itceased.“It is all over,” said Van Helsing. “She is dead!”I took Arthur by the arm, and led him away to the drawing-room, where hesat down, and covered his face with his hands, sobbing in a way thatnearly broke me down to see.I went back to the room, and found Van Helsing looking at poor Lucy, andhis face was sterner than ever. Some change had come over her body.Death had given back part of her beauty, for her brow and cheeks hadrecovered some of their flowing lines; even the lips had lost theirdeadly pallor. It was as if the blood, no longer needed for the workingof the heart, had gone to make the harshness of death as little rude asmight be.“We thought her dying whilst she slept,And sleeping when she died.”I stood beside Van Helsing, and said:--“Ah, well, poor girl, there is peace for her at last. It is the end!”He turned to me, and said with grave solemnity:--“Not so; alas! not so. It is only the beginning!”When I asked him what he meant, he only shook his head and answered:--“We can do nothing as yet. Wait and see.”CHAPTER XIIIDR. SEWARD’S DIARY--_continued_.The funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day, so that Lucy andher mother might be buried together. I attended to all the ghastlyformalities, and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff wereafflicted--or blessed--with something of his own obsequious suavity.Even the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked tome, in a confidential, brother-professional way, when she had come outfrom the death-chamber:--“She makes a very beautiful corpse, sir. It’s quite a privilege toattend on her. It’s not too much to say that she will do credit to ourestablishment!”I noticed that Van Helsing never kept far away. This was possible fromthe disordered state of things in the household. There were no relativesat hand; and as Arthur had to be back the next day to attend at hisfather’s funeral, we were unable to notify any one who should have beenbidden. Under the circumstances, Van Helsing and I took it uponourselves to examine papers, etc. He insisted upon looking over Lucy’spapers himself. I asked him why, for I feared that he, being aforeigner, might not be quite aware of English legal requirements, andso might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble. He answered me:--“I know; I know. You forget that I am a lawyer as well as a doctor. Butthis is not altogether for the law. You knew that, when you avoided thecoroner. I have more than him to avoid. There may be papers more--suchas this.”As he spoke he took from his pocket-book the memorandum which had beenin Lucy’s breast, and which she had torn in her sleep.“When you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late Mrs.Westenra, seal all her papers, and write him to-night. For me, I watchhere in the room and in Miss Lucy’s old room all night, and I myselfsearch for what may be. It is not well that her very thoughts go intothe hands of strangers.”I went on with my part of the work, and in another half hour had foundthe name and address of Mrs. Westenra’s solicitor and had written tohim. All the poor lady’s papers were in order; explicit directionsregarding the place of burial were given. I had hardly sealed theletter, when, to my surprise, Van Helsing walked into the room,saying:--“Can I help you, friend John? I am free, and if I may, my service is toyou.”“Have you got what you looked for?” I asked, to which he replied:--“I did not look for any specific thing. I only hoped to find, and find Ihave, all that there was--only some letters and a few memoranda, and adiary new begun. But I have them here, and we shall for the present saynothing of them. I shall see that poor lad to-morrow evening, and, withhis sanction, I shall use some.”When we had finished the work in hand, he said to me:--“And now, friend John, I think we may to bed. We want sleep, both youand I, and rest to recuperate. To-morrow we shall have much to do, butfor the to-night there is no need of us. Alas!”Before turning in we went to look at poor Lucy. The undertaker hadcertainly done his work well, for the room was turned into a small_chapelle ardente_. There was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers,and death was made as little repulsive as might be. The end of thewinding-sheet was laid over the face; when the Professor bent over andturned it gently back, we both started at the beauty before us, the tallwax candles showing a sufficient light to note it well. All Lucy’sloveliness had come back to her in death, and the hours that had passed,instead of leaving traces of “decay’s effacing fingers,” had butrestored the beauty of life, till positively I could not believe my eyesthat I was looking at a corpse.The Professor looked sternly grave. He had not loved her as I had, andthere was no need for tears in his eyes. He said to me: “Remain till Ireturn,” and left the room. He came back with a handful of wild garlicfrom the box waiting in the hall, but which had not been opened, andplaced the flowers amongst the others on and around the bed. Then hetook from his neck, inside his collar, a little gold crucifix, andplaced it over the mouth. He restored the sheet to its place, and wecame away.I was undressing in my own room, when, with a premonitory tap at thedoor, he entered, and at once began to speak:--“To-morrow I want you to bring me, before night, a set of post-mortemknives.”“Must we make an autopsy?” I asked.“Yes and no. I want to operate, but not as you think. Let me tell younow, but not a word to another. I want to cut off her head and take outher heart. Ah! you a surgeon, and so shocked! You, whom I have seen withno tremble of hand or heart, do operations of life and death that makethe rest shudder. Oh, but I must not forget, my dear friend John, thatyou loved her; and I have not forgotten it, for it is I that shalloperate, and you must only help. I would like to do it to-night, but forArthur I must not; he will be free after his father’s funeral to-morrow,and he will want to see her--to see _it_. Then, when she is coffinedready for the next day, you and I shall come when all sleep. We shallunscrew the coffin-lid, and shall do our operation: and then replaceall, so that none know, save we alone.”“But why do it at all? The girl is dead. Why mutilate her poor bodywithout need? And if there is no necessity for a post-mortem and nothingto gain by it--no good to her, to us, to science, to humanknowledge--why do it? Without such it is monstrous.”For answer he put his hand on my shoulder, and said, with infinitetenderness:--“Friend John, I pity your poor bleeding heart; and I love you the morebecause it does so bleed. If I could, I would take on myself the burdenthat you do bear. But there are things that you know not, but that youshall know, and bless me for knowing, though they are not pleasantthings. John, my child, you have been my friend now many years, and yetdid you ever know me to do any without good cause? I may err--I am butman; but I believe in all I do. Was it not for these causes that yousend for me when the great trouble came? Yes! Were you not amazed, nayhorrified, when I would not let Arthur kiss his love--though she wasdying--and snatched him away by all my strength? Yes! And yet you sawhow she thanked me, with her so beautiful dying eyes, her voice, too, soweak, and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me? Yes! And did you nothear me swear promise to her, that so she closed her eyes grateful? Yes!“Well, I have good reason now for all I want to do. You have for manyyears trust me; you have believe me weeks past, when there be things sostrange that you might have well doubt. Believe me yet a little, friendJohn. If you trust me not, then I must tell what I think; and that isnot perhaps well. And if I work--as work I shall, no matter trust or notrust--without my friend trust in me, I work with heavy heart and feel,oh! so lonely when I want all help and courage that may be!” He paused amoment and went on solemnly: “Friend John, there are strange andterrible days before us. Let us not be two, but one, that so we work toa good end. Will you not have faith in me?”I took his hand, and promised him. I held my door open as he went away,and watched him go into his room and close the door. As I stood withoutmoving, I saw one of the maids pass silently along the passage--she hadher back towards me, so did not see me--and go into the room where Lucylay. The sight touched me. Devotion is so rare, and we are so gratefulto those who show it unasked to those we love. Here was a poor girlputting aside the terrors which she naturally had of death to go watchalone by the bier of the mistress whom she loved, so that the poor claymight not be lonely till laid to eternal rest....*       *       *       *       *I must have slept long and soundly, for it was broad daylight when VanHelsing waked me by coming into my room. He came over to my bedside andsaid:--“You need not trouble about the knives; we shall not do it.”“Why not?” I asked. For his solemnity of the night before had greatlyimpressed me.“Because,” he said sternly, “it is too late--or too early. See!” Here heheld up the little golden crucifix. “This was stolen in the night.”“How, stolen,” I asked in wonder, “since you have it now?”“Because I get it back from the worthless wretch who stole it, from thewoman who robbed the dead and the living. Her punishment will surelycome, but not through me; she knew not altogether what she did and thusunknowing, she only stole. Now we must wait.”He went away on the word, leaving me with a new mystery to think of, anew puzzle to grapple with.The forenoon was a dreary time, but at noon the solicitor came: Mr.Marquand, of Wholeman, Sons, Marquand & Lidderdale. He was very genialand very appreciative of what we had done, and took off our hands allcares as to details. During lunch he told us that Mrs. Westenra had forsome time expected sudden death from her heart, and had put her affairsin absolute order; he informed us that, with the exception of a certainentailed property of Lucy’s father’s which now, in default of directissue, went back to a distant branch of the family, the whole estate,real and personal, was left absolutely to Arthur Holmwood. When he hadtold us so much he went on:--“Frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary disposition, andpointed out certain contingencies that might leave her daughter eitherpenniless or not so free as she should be to act regarding a matrimonialalliance. Indeed, we pressed the matter so far that we almost came intocollision, for she asked us if we were or were not prepared to carry outher wishes. Of course, we had then no alternative but to accept. We wereright in principle, and ninety-nine times out of a hundred we shouldhave proved, by the logic of events, the accuracy of our judgment.Frankly, however, I must admit that in this case any other form ofdisposition would have rendered impossible the carrying out of herwishes. For by her predeceasing her daughter the latter would have comeinto possession of the property, and, even had she only survived hermother by five minutes, her property would, in case there were nowill--and a will was a practical impossibility in such a case--have beentreated at her decease as under intestacy. In which case Lord Godalming,though so dear a friend, would have had no claim in the world; and theinheritors, being remote, would not be likely to abandon their justrights, for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger. I assureyou, my dear sirs, I am rejoiced at the result, perfectly rejoiced.”He was a good fellow, but his rejoicing at the one little part--in whichhe was officially interested--of so great a tragedy, was anobject-lesson in the limitations of sympathetic understanding.He did not remain long, but said he would look in later in the day andsee Lord Godalming. His coming, however, had been a certain comfort tous, since it assured us that we should not have to dread hostilecriticism as to any of our acts. Arthur was expected at five o’clock, soa little before that time we visited the death-chamber. It was so invery truth, for now both mother and daughter lay in it. The undertaker,true to his craft, had made the best display he could of his goods, andthere was a mortuary air about the place that lowered our spirits atonce. Van Helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adhered to,explaining that, as Lord Godalming was coming very soon, it would beless harrowing to his feelings to see all that was left of his _fiancée_quite alone. The undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity andexerted himself to restore things to the condition in which we left themthe night before, so that when Arthur came such shocks to his feelingsas we could avoid were saved.Poor fellow! He looked desperately sad and broken; even his stalwartmanhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of hismuch-tried emotions. He had, I knew, been very genuinely and devotedlyattached to his father; and to lose him, and at such a time, was abitter blow to him. With me he was warm as ever, and to Van Helsing hewas sweetly courteous; but I could not help seeing that there was someconstraint with him. The Professor noticed it, too, and motioned me tobring him upstairs. I did so, and left him at the door of the room, as Ifelt he would like to be quite alone with her, but he took my arm andled me in, saying huskily:--“You loved her too, old fellow; she told me all about it, and there wasno friend had a closer place in her heart than you. I don’t know how tothank you for all you have done for her. I can’t think yet....”Here he suddenly broke down, and threw his arms round my shoulders andlaid his head on my breast, crying:--“Oh, Jack! Jack! What shall I do! The whole of life seems gone from meall at once, and there is nothing in the wide world for me to live for.”I comforted him as well as I could. In such cases men do not need muchexpression. A grip of the hand, the tightening of an arm over theshoulder, a sob in unison, are expressions of sympathy dear to a man’sheart. I stood still and silent till his sobs died away, and then I saidsoftly to him:--“Come and look at her.”Together we moved over to the bed, and I lifted the lawn from her face.God! how beautiful she was. Every hour seemed to be enhancing herloveliness. It frightened and amazed me somewhat; and as for Arthur, hefell a-trembling, and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague. Atlast, after a long pause, he said to me in a faint whisper:--“Jack, is she really dead?”I assured him sadly that it was so, and went on to suggest--for I feltthat such a horrible doubt should not have life for a moment longer thanI could help--that it often happened that after death faces becamesoftened and even resolved into their youthful beauty; that this wasespecially so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolongedsuffering. It seemed to quite do away with any doubt, and, afterkneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at her lovingly andlong, he turned aside. I told him that that must be good-bye, as thecoffin had to be prepared; so he went back and took her dead hand in hisand kissed it, and bent over and kissed her forehead. He came away,fondly looking back over his shoulder at her as he came.I left him in the drawing-room, and told Van Helsing that he had saidgood-bye; so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertaker’s mento proceed with the preparations and to screw up the coffin. When hecame out of the room again I told him of Arthur’s question, and hereplied:--“I am not surprised. Just now I doubted for a moment myself!”We all dined together, and I could see that poor Art was trying to makethe best of things. Van Helsing had been silent all dinner-time; butwhen we had lit our cigars he said--“Lord----”; but Arthur interrupted him:--“No, no, not that, for God’s sake! not yet at any rate. Forgive me, sir:I did not mean to speak offensively; it is only because my loss is sorecent.”The Professor answered very sweetly:--“I only used that name because I was in doubt. I must not call you‘Mr.,’ and I have grown to love you--yes, my dear boy, to love you--asArthur.”Arthur held out his hand, and took the old man’s warmly.“Call me what you will,” he said. “I hope I may always have the title ofa friend. And let me say that I am at a loss for words to thank you foryour goodness to my poor dear.” He paused a moment, and went on: “I knowthat she understood your goodness even better than I do; and if I wasrude or in any way wanting at that time you acted so--you remember”--theProfessor nodded--“you must forgive me.”He answered with a grave kindness:--“I know it was hard for you to quite trust me then, for to trust suchviolence needs to understand; and I take it that you do not--that youcannot--trust me now, for you do not yet understand. And there may bemore times when I shall want you to trust when you cannot--and maynot--and must not yet understand. But the time will come when your trustshall be whole and complete in me, and when you shall understand asthough the sunlight himself shone through. Then you shall bless me fromfirst to last for your own sake, and for the sake of others and for herdear sake to whom I swore to protect.”“And, indeed, indeed, sir,” said Arthur warmly, “I shall in all waystrust you. I know and believe you have a very noble heart, and you areJack’s friend, and you were hers. You shall do what you like.”The Professor cleared his throat a couple of times, as though about tospeak, and finally said:--“May I ask you something now?”“Certainly.”“You know that Mrs. Westenra left you all her property?”“No, poor dear; I never thought of it.”“And as it is all yours, you have a right to deal with it as you will. Iwant you to give me permission to read all Miss Lucy’s papers andletters. Believe me, it is no idle curiosity. I have a motive of which,be sure, she would have approved. I have them all here. I took thembefore we knew that all was yours, so that no strange hand might touchthem--no strange eye look through words into her soul. I shall keepthem, if I may; even you may not see them yet, but I shall keep themsafe. No word shall be lost; and in the good time I shall give them backto you. It’s a hard thing I ask, but you will do it, will you not, forLucy’s sake?”Arthur spoke out heartily, like his old self:--“Dr. Van Helsing, you may do what you will. I feel that in saying this Iam doing what my dear one would have approved. I shall not trouble youwith questions till the time comes.”The old Professor stood up as he said solemnly:--“And you are right. There will be pain for us all; but it will not beall pain, nor will this pain be the last. We and you too--you most ofall, my dear boy--will have to pass through the bitter water before wereach the sweet. But we must be brave of heart and unselfish, and do ourduty, and all will be well!”I slept on a sofa in Arthur’s room that night. Van Helsing did not go tobed at all. He went to and fro, as if patrolling the house, and wasnever out of sight of the room where Lucy lay in her coffin, strewn withthe wild garlic flowers, which sent, through the odour of lily and rose,a heavy, overpowering smell into the night._Mina Harker’s Journal.__22 September._--In the train to Exeter. Jonathan sleeping.It seems only yesterday that the last entry was made, and yet how muchbetween then, in Whitby and all the world before me, Jonathan away andno news of him; and now, married to Jonathan, Jonathan a solicitor, apartner, rich, master of his business, Mr. Hawkins dead and buried, andJonathan with another attack that may harm him. Some day he may ask meabout it. Down it all goes. I am rusty in my shorthand--see whatunexpected prosperity does for us--so it may be as well to freshen it upagain with an exercise anyhow....The service was very simple and very solemn. There were only ourselvesand the servants there, one or two old friends of his from Exeter, hisLondon agent, and a gentleman representing Sir John Paxton, thePresident of the Incorporated Law Society. Jonathan and I stood hand inhand, and we felt that our best and dearest friend was gone from us....We came back to town quietly, taking a ’bus to Hyde Park Corner.Jonathan thought it would interest me to go into the Row for a while, sowe sat down; but there were very few people there, and it wassad-looking and desolate to see so many empty chairs. It made us thinkof the empty chair at home; so we got up and walked down Piccadilly.Jonathan was holding me by the arm, the way he used to in old daysbefore I went to school. I felt it very improper, for you can’t go onfor some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls without thepedantry of it biting into yourself a bit; but it was Jonathan, and hewas my husband, and we didn’t know anybody who saw us--and we didn’tcare if they did--so on we walked. I was looking at a very beautifulgirl, in a big cart-wheel hat, sitting in a victoria outside Guiliano’s,when I felt Jonathan clutch my arm so tight that he hurt me, and he saidunder his breath: “My God!” I am always anxious about Jonathan, for Ifear that some nervous fit may upset him again; so I turned to himquickly, and asked him what it was that disturbed him.He was very pale, and his eyes seemed bulging out as, half in terror andhalf in amazement, he gazed at a tall, thin man, with a beaky nose andblack moustache and pointed beard, who was also observing the prettygirl. He was looking at her so hard that he did not see either of us,and so I had a good view of him. His face was not a good face; it washard, and cruel, and sensual, and his big white teeth, that looked allthe whiter because his lips were so red, were pointed like an animal’s.Jonathan kept staring at him, till I was afraid he would notice. Ifeared he might take it ill, he looked so fierce and nasty. I askedJonathan why he was disturbed, and he answered, evidently thinking thatI knew as much about it as he did: “Do you see who it is?”“No, dear,” I said; “I don’t know him; who is it?” His answer seemed toshock and thrill me, for it was said as if he did not know that it wasto me, Mina, to whom he was speaking:--“It is the man himself!”The poor dear was evidently terrified at something--very greatlyterrified; I do believe that if he had not had me to lean on and tosupport him he would have sunk down. He kept staring; a man came out ofthe shop with a small parcel, and gave it to the lady, who then droveoff. The dark man kept his eyes fixed on her, and when the carriagemoved up Piccadilly he followed in the same direction, and hailed ahansom. Jonathan kept looking after him, and said, as if to himself:--“I believe it is the Count, but he has grown young. My God, if this beso! Oh, my God! my God! If I only knew! if I only knew!” He wasdistressing himself so much that I feared to keep his mind on thesubject by asking him any questions, so I remained silent. I drew himaway quietly, and he, holding my arm, came easily. We walked a littlefurther, and then went in and sat for a while in the Green Park. It wasa hot day for autumn, and there was a comfortable seat in a shady place.After a few minutes’ staring at nothing, Jonathan’s eyes closed, and hewent quietly into a sleep, with his head on my shoulder. I thought itwas the best thing for him, so did not disturb him. In about twentyminutes he woke up, and said to me quite cheerfully:--“Why, Mina, have I been asleep! Oh, do forgive me for being so rude.Come, and we’ll have a cup of tea somewhere.” He had evidently forgottenall about the dark stranger, as in his illness he had forgotten all thatthis episode had reminded him of. I don’t like this lapsing intoforgetfulness; it may make or continue some injury to the brain. I mustnot ask him, for fear I shall do more harm than good; but I must somehowlearn the facts of his journey abroad. The time is come, I fear, when Imust open that parcel, and know what is written. Oh, Jonathan, you will,I know, forgive me if I do wrong, but it is for your own dear sake.*       *       *       *       *_Later._--A sad home-coming in every way--the house empty of the dearsoul who was so good to us; Jonathan still pale and dizzy under a slightrelapse of his malady; and now a telegram from Van Helsing, whoever hemay be:--“You will be grieved to hear that Mrs. Westenra died five days ago, andthat Lucy died the day before yesterday. They were both buried to-day.”Oh, what a wealth of sorrow in a few words! Poor Mrs. Westenra! poorLucy! Gone, gone, never to return to us! And poor, poor Arthur, to havelost such sweetness out of his life! God help us all to bear ourtroubles._Dr. Seward’s Diary.__22 September._--It is all over. Arthur has gone back to Ring, and hastaken Quincey Morris with him. What a fine fellow is Quincey! I believein my heart of hearts that he suffered as much about Lucy’s death as anyof us; but he bore himself through it like a moral Viking. If Americacan go on breeding men like that, she will be a power in the worldindeed. Van Helsing is lying down, having a rest preparatory to hisjourney. He goes over to Amsterdam to-night, but says he returnsto-morrow night; that he only wants to make some arrangements which canonly be made personally. He is to stop with me then, if he can; he sayshe has work to do in London which may take him some time. Poor oldfellow! I fear that the strain of the past week has broken down even hisiron strength. All the time of the burial he was, I could see, puttingsome terrible restraint on himself. When it was all over, we werestanding beside Arthur, who, poor fellow, was speaking of his part inthe operation where his blood had been transfused to his Lucy’s veins; Icould see Van Helsing’s face grow white and purple by turns. Arthur wassaying that he felt since then as if they two had been really marriedand that she was his wife in the sight of God. None of us said a word ofthe other operations, and none of us ever shall. Arthur and Quincey wentaway together to the station, and Van Helsing and I came on here. Themoment we were alone in the carriage he gave way to a regular fit ofhysterics. He has denied to me since that it was hysterics, and insistedthat it was only his sense of humour asserting itself under veryterrible conditions. He laughed till he cried, and I had to draw downthe blinds lest any one should see us and misjudge; and then he cried,till he laughed again; and laughed and cried together, just as a womandoes. I tried to be stern with him, as one is to a woman under thecircumstances; but it had no effect. Men and women are so different inmanifestations of nervous strength or weakness! Then when his face grewgrave and stern again I asked him why his mirth, and why at such a time.His reply was in a way characteristic of him, for it was logical andforceful and mysterious. He said:--“Ah, you don’t comprehend, friend John. Do not think that I am not sad,though I laugh. See, I have cried even when the laugh did choke me. Butno more think that I am all sorry when I cry, for the laugh he comejust the same. Keep it always with you that laughter who knock at yourdoor and say, ‘May I come in?’ is not the true laughter. No! he is aking, and he come when and how he like. He ask no person; he choose notime of suitability. He say, ‘I am here.’ Behold, in example I grieve myheart out for that so sweet young girl; I give my blood for her, thoughI am old and worn; I give my time, my skill, my sleep; I let my othersufferers want that so she may have all. And yet I can laugh at her verygrave--laugh when the clay from the spade of the sexton drop upon hercoffin and say ‘Thud! thud!’ to my heart, till it send back the bloodfrom my cheek. My heart bleed for that poor boy--that dear boy, so ofthe age of mine own boy had I been so blessed that he live, and with hishair and eyes the same. There, you know now why I love him so. And yetwhen he say things that touch my husband-heart to the quick, and make myfather-heart yearn to him as to no other man--not even to you, friendJohn, for we are more level in experiences than father and son--yet evenat such moment King Laugh he come to me and shout and bellow in my ear,‘Here I am! here I am!’ till the blood come dance back and bring some ofthe sunshine that he carry with him to my cheek. Oh, friend John, it isa strange world, a sad world, a world full of miseries, and woes, andtroubles; and yet when King Laugh come he make them all dance to thetune he play. Bleeding hearts, and dry bones of the churchyard, andtears that burn as they fall--all dance together to the music that hemake with that smileless mouth of him. And believe me, friend John, thathe is good to come, and kind. Ah, we men and women are like ropes drawntight with strain that pull us different ways. Then tears come; and,like the rain on the ropes, they brace us up, until perhaps the strainbecome too great, and we break. But King Laugh he come like thesunshine, and he ease off the strain again; and we bear to go on withour labour, what it may be.”I did not like to wound him by pretending not to see his idea; but, as Idid not yet understand the cause of his laughter, I asked him. As heanswered me his face grew stern, and he said in quite a differenttone:--“Oh, it was the grim irony of it all--this so lovely lady garlanded withflowers, that looked so fair as life, till one by one we wondered if shewere truly dead; she laid in that so fine marble house in that lonelychurchyard, where rest so many of her kin, laid there with the motherwho loved her, and whom she loved; and that sacred bell going ‘Toll!toll! toll!’ so sad and slow; and those holy men, with the whitegarments of the angel, pretending to read books, and yet all the timetheir eyes never on the page; and all of us with the bowed head. And allfor what? She is dead; so! Is it not?”“Well, for the life of me, Professor,” I said, “I can’t see anything tolaugh at in all that. Why, your explanation makes it a harder puzzlethan before. But even if the burial service was comic, what about poorArt and his trouble? Why, his heart was simply breaking.”“Just so. Said he not that the transfusion of his blood to her veins hadmade her truly his bride?”“Yes, and it was a sweet and comforting idea for him.”“Quite so. But there was a difficulty, friend John. If so that, thenwhat about the others? Ho, ho! Then this so sweet maid is a polyandrist,and me, with my poor wife dead to me, but alive by Church’s law, thoughno wits, all gone--even I, who am faithful husband to this now-no-wife,am bigamist.”“I don’t see where the joke comes in there either!” I said; and I didnot feel particularly pleased with him for saying such things. He laidhis hand on my arm, and said:--“Friend John, forgive me if I pain. I showed not my feeling to otherswhen it would wound, but only to you, my old friend, whom I can trust.If you could have looked into my very heart then when I want to laugh;if you could have done so when the laugh arrived; if you could do sonow, when King Laugh have pack up his crown, and all that is to him--forhe go far, far away from me, and for a long, long time--maybe you wouldperhaps pity me the most of all.”I was touched by the tenderness of his tone, and asked why.“Because I know!”And now we are all scattered; and for many a long day loneliness willsit over our roofs with brooding wings. Lucy lies in the tomb of herkin, a lordly death-house in a lonely churchyard, away from teemingLondon; where the air is fresh, and the sun rises over Hampstead Hill,and where wild flowers grow of their own accord.So I can finish this diary; and God only knows if I shall ever beginanother. If I do, or if I even open this again, it will be to deal withdifferent people and different themes; for here at the end, where theromance of my life is told, ere I go back to take up the thread of mylife-work, I say sadly and without hope,“FINIS.”_“The Westminster Gazette,” 25 September._A HAMPSTEAD MYSTERY.The neighbourhood of Hampstead is just at present exercised with aseries of events which seem to run on lines parallel to those of whatwas known to the writers of headlines as “The Kensington Horror,” or“The Stabbing Woman,” or “The Woman in Black.” During the past two orthree days several cases have occurred of young children straying fromhome or neglecting to return from their playing on the Heath. In allthese cases the children were too young to give any properlyintelligible account of themselves, but the consensus of their excusesis that they had been with a “bloofer lady.” It has always been late inthe evening when they have been missed, and on two occasions thechildren have not been found until early in the following morning. It isgenerally supposed in the neighbourhood that, as the first child missedgave as his reason for being away that a “bloofer lady” had asked him tocome for a walk, the others had picked up the phrase and used it asoccasion served. This is the more natural as the favourite game of thelittle ones at present is luring each other away by wiles. Acorrespondent writes us that to see some of the tiny tots pretending tobe the “bloofer lady” is supremely funny. Some of our caricaturistsmight, he says, take a lesson in the irony of grotesque by comparing thereality and the picture. It is only in accordance with generalprinciples of human nature that the “bloofer lady” should be the popularrôle at these _al fresco_ performances. Our correspondent naïvely saysthat even Ellen Terry could not be so winningly attractive as some ofthese grubby-faced little children pretend--and even imaginethemselves--to be.There is, however, possibly a serious side to the question, for some ofthe children, indeed all who have been missed at night, have beenslightly torn or wounded in the throat. The wounds seem such as might bemade by a rat or a small dog, and although of not much importanceindividually, would tend to show that whatever animal inflicts them hasa system or method of its own. The police of the division have beeninstructed to keep a sharp look-out for straying children, especiallywhen very young, in and around Hampstead Heath, and for any stray dogwhich may be about._“The Westminster Gazette,” 25 September.__Extra Special._THE HAMPSTEAD HORROR.ANOTHER CHILD INJURED._The “Bloofer Lady.”_We have just received intelligence that another child, missed lastnight, was only discovered late in the morning under a furze bush at theShooter’s Hill side of Hampstead Heath, which is, perhaps, lessfrequented than the other parts. It has the same tiny wound in thethroat as has been noticed in other cases. It was terribly weak, andlooked quite emaciated. It too, when partially restored, had the commonstory to tell of being lured away by the “bloofer lady.”CHAPTER XIVMINA HARKER’S JOURNAL_23 September_.--Jonathan is better after a bad night. I am so glad thathe has plenty of work to do, for that keeps his mind off the terriblethings; and oh, I am rejoiced that he is not now weighed down with theresponsibility of his new position. I knew he would be true to himself,and now how proud I am to see my Jonathan rising to the height of hisadvancement and keeping pace in all ways with the duties that come uponhim. He will be away all day till late, for he said he could not lunchat home. My household work is done, so I shall take his foreign journal,and lock myself up in my room and read it...._24 September_.--I hadn’t the heart to write last night; that terriblerecord of Jonathan’s upset me so. Poor dear! How he must have suffered,whether it be true or only imagination. I wonder if there is any truthin it at all. Did he get his brain fever, and then write all thoseterrible things, or had he some cause for it all? I suppose I shallnever know, for I dare not open the subject to him.... And yet that manwe saw yesterday! He seemed quite certain of him.... Poor fellow! Isuppose it was the funeral upset him and sent his mind back on sometrain of thought.... He believes it all himself. I remember how on ourwedding-day he said: “Unless some solemn duty come upon me to go back tothe bitter hours, asleep or awake, mad or sane.” There seems to bethrough it all some thread of continuity.... That fearful Count wascoming to London.... If it should be, and he came to London, with histeeming millions.... There may be a solemn duty; and if it come we mustnot shrink from it.... I shall be prepared. I shall get my typewriterthis very hour and begin transcribing. Then we shall be ready for othereyes if required. And if it be wanted; then, perhaps, if I am ready,poor Jonathan may not be upset, for I can speak for him and never lethim be troubled or worried with it at all. If ever Jonathan quite getsover the nervousness he may want to tell me of it all, and I can ask himquestions and find out things, and see how I may comfort him._Letter, Van Helsing to Mrs. Harker._“_24 September._(_Confidence_)“Dear Madam,--“I pray you to pardon my writing, in that I am so far friend as that Isent to you sad news of Miss Lucy Westenra’s death. By the kindness ofLord Godalming, I am empowered to read her letters and papers, for I amdeeply concerned about certain matters vitally important. In them I findsome letters from you, which show how great friends you were and how youlove her. Oh, Madam Mina, by that love, I implore you, help me. It isfor others’ good that I ask--to redress great wrong, and to lift muchand terrible troubles--that may be more great than you can know. May itbe that I see you? You can trust me. I am friend of Dr. John Seward andof Lord Godalming (that was Arthur of Miss Lucy). I must keep it privatefor the present from all. I should come to Exeter to see you at once ifyou tell me I am privilege to come, and where and when. I implore yourpardon, madam. I have read your letters to poor Lucy, and know how goodyou are and how your husband suffer; so I pray you, if it may be,enlighten him not, lest it may harm. Again your pardon, and forgive me.“VAN HELSING.”_Telegram, Mrs. Harker to Van Helsing._“_25 September._--Come to-day by quarter-past ten train if you can catchit. Can see you any time you call.“WILHELMINA HARKER.”MINA HARKER’S JOURNAL._25 September._--I cannot help feeling terribly excited as the timedraws near for the visit of Dr. Van Helsing, for somehow I expect thatit will throw some light upon Jonathan’s sad experience; and as heattended poor dear Lucy in her last illness, he can tell me all abouther. That is the reason of his coming; it is concerning Lucy and hersleep-walking, and not about Jonathan. Then I shall never know the realtruth now! How silly I am. That awful journal gets hold of myimagination and tinges everything with something of its own colour. Ofcourse it is about Lucy. That habit came back to the poor dear, and thatawful night on the cliff must have made her ill. I had almost forgottenin my own affairs how ill she was afterwards. She must have told himof her sleep-walking adventure on the cliff, and that I knew all aboutit; and now he wants me to tell him what she knows, so that he mayunderstand. I hope I did right in not saying anything of it to Mrs.Westenra; I should never forgive myself if any act of mine, were it evena negative one, brought harm on poor dear Lucy. I hope, too, Dr. VanHelsing will not blame me; I have had so much trouble and anxiety oflate that I feel I cannot bear more just at present.I suppose a cry does us all good at times--clears the air as other raindoes. Perhaps it was reading the journal yesterday that upset me, andthen Jonathan went away this morning to stay away from me a whole dayand night, the first time we have been parted since our marriage. I dohope the dear fellow will take care of himself, and that nothing willoccur to upset him. It is two o’clock, and the doctor will be here soonnow. I shall say nothing of Jonathan’s journal unless he asks me. I amso glad I have type-written out my own journal, so that, in case he asksabout Lucy, I can hand it to him; it will save much questioning.*       *       *       *       *_Later._--He has come and gone. Oh, what a strange meeting, and how itall makes my head whirl round! I feel like one in a dream. Can it be allpossible, or even a part of it? If I had not read Jonathan’s journalfirst, I should never have accepted even a possibility. Poor, poor, dearJonathan! How he must have suffered. Please the good God, all this maynot upset him again. I shall try to save him from it; but it may be evena consolation and a help to him--terrible though it be and awful in itsconsequences--to know for certain that his eyes and ears and brain didnot deceive him, and that it is all true. It may be that it is the doubtwhich haunts him; that when the doubt is removed, no matterwhich--waking or dreaming--may prove the truth, he will be moresatisfied and better able to bear the shock. Dr. Van Helsing must be agood man as well as a clever one if he is Arthur’s friend and Dr.Seward’s, and if they brought him all the way from Holland to look afterLucy. I feel from having seen him that he _is_ good and kind and of anoble nature. When he comes to-morrow I shall ask him about Jonathan;and then, please God, all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to a goodend. I used to think I would like to practise interviewing; Jonathan’sfriend on “The Exeter News” told him that memory was everything in suchwork--that you must be able to put down exactly almost every wordspoken, even if you had to refine some of it afterwards. Here was a rareinterview; I shall try to record it _verbatim_.It was half-past two o’clock when the knock came. I took my courage _àdeux mains_ and waited. In a few minutes Mary opened the door, andannounced “Dr. Van Helsing.”I rose and bowed, and he came towards me; a man of medium weight,strongly built, with his shoulders set back over a broad, deep chest anda neck well balanced on the trunk as the head is on the neck. The poiseof the head strikes one at once as indicative of thought and power; thehead is noble, well-sized, broad, and large behind the ears. The face,clean-shaven, shows a hard, square chin, a large, resolute, mobilemouth, a good-sized nose, rather straight, but with quick, sensitivenostrils, that seem to broaden as the big, bushy brows come down and themouth tightens. The forehead is broad and fine, rising at first almoststraight and then sloping back above two bumps or ridges wide apart;such a forehead that the reddish hair cannot possibly tumble over it,but falls naturally back and to the sides. Big, dark blue eyes are setwidely apart, and are quick and tender or stern with the man’s moods. Hesaid to me:--“Mrs. Harker, is it not?” I bowed assent.“That was Miss Mina Murray?” Again I assented.“It is Mina Murray that I came to see that was friend of that poor dearchild Lucy Westenra. Madam Mina, it is on account of the dead I come.”“Sir,” I said, “you could have no better claim on me than that you werea friend and helper of Lucy Westenra.” And I held out my hand. He tookit and said tenderly:--“Oh, Madam Mina, I knew that the friend of that poor lily girl must begood, but I had yet to learn----” He finished his speech with a courtlybow. I asked him what it was that he wanted to see me about, so he atonce began:--“I have read your letters to Miss Lucy. Forgive me, but I had to beginto inquire somewhere, and there was none to ask. I know that you werewith her at Whitby. She sometimes kept a diary--you need not looksurprised, Madam Mina; it was begun after you had left, and was inimitation of you--and in that diary she traces by inference certainthings to a sleep-walking in which she puts down that you saved her. Ingreat perplexity then I come to you, and ask you out of your so muchkindness to tell me all of it that you can remember.”“I can tell you, I think, Dr. Van Helsing, all about it.”“Ah, then you have good memory for facts, for details? It is not alwaysso with young ladies.”“No, doctor, but I wrote it all down at the time. I can show it to youif you like.”“Oh, Madam Mina, I will be grateful; you will do me much favour.” Icould not resist the temptation of mystifying him a bit--I suppose it issome of the taste of the original apple that remains still in ourmouths--so I handed him the shorthand diary. He took it with a gratefulbow, and said:--“May I read it?”“If you wish,” I answered as demurely as I could. He opened it, and foran instant his face fell. Then he stood up and bowed.“Oh, you so clever woman!” he said. “I knew long that Mr. Jonathan was aman of much thankfulness; but see, his wife have all the good things.And will you not so much honour me and so help me as to read it for me?Alas! I know not the shorthand.” By this time my little joke was over,and I was almost ashamed; so I took the typewritten copy from myworkbasket and handed it to him.“Forgive me,” I said: “I could not help it; but I had been thinking thatit was of dear Lucy that you wished to ask, and so that you might nothave time to wait--not on my account, but because I know your time mustbe precious--I have written it out on the typewriter for you.”He took it and his eyes glistened. “You are so good,” he said. “And mayI read it now? I may want to ask you some things when I have read.”“By all means,” I said, “read it over whilst I order lunch; and then youcan ask me questions whilst we eat.” He bowed and settled himself in achair with his back to the light, and became absorbed in the papers,whilst I went to see after lunch chiefly in order that he might not bedisturbed. When I came back, I found him walking hurriedly up and downthe room, his face all ablaze with excitement. He rushed up to me andtook me by both hands.“Oh, Madam Mina,” he said, “how can I say what I owe to you? This paperis as sunshine. It opens the gate to me. I am daze, I am dazzle, with somuch light, and yet clouds roll in behind the light every time. But thatyou do not, cannot, comprehend. Oh, but I am grateful to you, you soclever woman. Madam”--he said this very solemnly--“if ever Abraham VanHelsing can do anything for you or yours, I trust you will let me know.It will be pleasure and delight if I may serve you as a friend; as afriend, but all I have ever learned, all I can ever do, shall be for youand those you love. There are darknesses in life, and there are lights;you are one of the lights. You will have happy life and good life, andyour husband will be blessed in you.”“But, doctor, you praise me too much, and--and you do not know me.”“Not know you--I, who am old, and who have studied all my life men andwomen; I, who have made my specialty the brain and all that belongs tohim and all that follow from him! And I have read your diary that youhave so goodly written for me, and which breathes out truth in everyline. I, who have read your so sweet letter to poor Lucy of yourmarriage and your trust, not know you! Oh, Madam Mina, good women tellall their lives, and by day and by hour and by minute, such things thatangels can read; and we men who wish to know have in us something ofangels’ eyes. Your husband is noble nature, and you are noble too, foryou trust, and trust cannot be where there is mean nature. And yourhusband--tell me of him. Is he quite well? Is all that fever gone, andis he strong and hearty?” I saw here an opening to ask him aboutJonathan, so I said:--“He was almost recovered, but he has been greatly upset by Mr. Hawkins’sdeath.” He interrupted:--“Oh, yes, I know, I know. I have read your last two letters.” I wenton:--“I suppose this upset him, for when we were in town on Thursday last hehad a sort of shock.”“A shock, and after brain fever so soon! That was not good. What kind ofa shock was it?”“He thought he saw some one who recalled something terrible, somethingwhich led to his brain fever.” And here the whole thing seemed tooverwhelm me in a rush. The pity for Jonathan, the horror which heexperienced, the whole fearful mystery of his diary, and the fear thathas been brooding over me ever since, all came in a tumult. I suppose Iwas hysterical, for I threw myself on my knees and held up my hands tohim, and implored him to make my husband well again. He took my handsand raised me up, and made me sit on the sofa, and sat by me; he held myhand in his, and said to me with, oh, such infinite sweetness:--“My life is a barren and lonely one, and so full of work that I have nothad much time for friendships; but since I have been summoned to here bymy friend John Seward I have known so many good people and seen suchnobility that I feel more than ever--and it has grown with my advancingyears--the loneliness of my life. Believe, me, then, that I come herefull of respect for you, and you have given me hope--hope, not in what Iam seeking of, but that there are good women still left to make lifehappy--good women, whose lives and whose truths may make good lesson forthe children that are to be. I am glad, glad, that I may here be of someuse to you; for if your husband suffer, he suffer within the range of mystudy and experience. I promise you that I will gladly do _all_ for himthat I can--all to make his life strong and manly, and your life a happyone. Now you must eat. You are overwrought and perhaps over-anxious.Husband Jonathan would not like to see you so pale; and what he like notwhere he love, is not to his good. Therefore for his sake you must eatand smile. You have told me all about Lucy, and so now we shall notspeak of it, lest it distress. I shall stay in Exeter to-night, for Iwant to think much over what you have told me, and when I have thought Iwill ask you questions, if I may. And then, too, you will tell me ofhusband Jonathan’s trouble so far as you can, but not yet. You must eatnow; afterwards you shall tell me all.”After lunch, when we went back to the drawing-room, he said to me:--“And now tell me all about him.” When it came to speaking to this greatlearned man, I began to fear that he would think me a weak fool, andJonathan a madman--that journal is all so strange--and I hesitated to goon. But he was so sweet and kind, and he had promised to help, and Itrusted him, so I said:--“Dr. Van Helsing, what I have to tell you is so queer that you must notlaugh at me or at my husband. I have been since yesterday in a sort offever of doubt; you must be kind to me, and not think me foolish that Ihave even half believed some very strange things.” He reassured me byhis manner as well as his words when he said:--“Oh, my dear, if you only know how strange is the matter regarding whichI am here, it is you who would laugh. I have learned not to think littleof any one’s belief, no matter how strange it be. I have tried to keepan open mind; and it is not the ordinary things of life that could closeit, but the strange things, the extraordinary things, the things thatmake one doubt if they be mad or sane.”“Thank you, thank you, a thousand times! You have taken a weight off mymind. If you will let me, I shall give you a paper to read. It is long,but I have typewritten it out. It will tell you my trouble andJonathan’s. It is the copy of his journal when abroad, and all thathappened. I dare not say anything of it; you will read for yourself andjudge. And then when I see you, perhaps, you will be very kind and tellme what you think.”“I promise,” he said as I gave him the papers; “I shall in the morning,so soon as I can, come to see you and your husband, if I may.”“Jonathan will be here at half-past eleven, and you must come to lunchwith us and see him then; you could catch the quick 3:34 train, whichwill leave you at Paddington before eight.” He was surprised at myknowledge of the trains off-hand, but he does not know that I have madeup all the trains to and from Exeter, so that I may help Jonathan incase he is in a hurry.So he took the papers with him and went away, and I sit herethinking--thinking I don’t know what.*       *       *       *       *_Letter (by hand), Van Helsing to Mrs. Harker._“_25 September, 6 o’clock._“Dear Madam Mina,--“I have read your husband’s so wonderful diary. You may sleep withoutdoubt. Strange and terrible as it is, it is _true_! I will pledge mylife on it. It may be worse for others; but for him and you there is nodread. He is a noble fellow; and let me tell you from experience of men,that one who would do as he did in going down that wall and to thatroom--ay, and going a second time--is not one to be injured inpermanence by a shock. His brain and his heart are all right; this Iswear, before I have even seen him; so be at rest. I shall have much toask him of other things. I am blessed that to-day I come to see you, forI have learn all at once so much that again I am dazzle--dazzle morethan ever, and I must think.“Yours the most faithful,“ABRAHAM VAN HELSING.”_Letter, Mrs. Harker to Van Helsing._“_25 September, 6:30 p. m._“My dear Dr. Van Helsing,--“A thousand thanks for your kind letter, which has taken a great weightoff my mind. And yet, if it be true, what terrible things there are inthe world, and what an awful thing if that man, that monster, be reallyin London! I fear to think. I have this moment, whilst writing, had awire from Jonathan, saying that he leaves by the 6:25 to-night fromLaunceston and will be here at 10:18, so that I shall have no fearto-night. Will you, therefore, instead of lunching with us, please cometo breakfast at eight o’clock, if this be not too early for you? You canget away, if you are in a hurry, by the 10:30 train, which will bringyou to Paddington by 2:35. Do not answer this, as I shall take it that,if I do not hear, you will come to breakfast.“Believe me,“Your faithful and grateful friend,“MINA HARKER.”_Jonathan Harker’s Journal.__26 September._--I thought never to write in this diary again, but thetime has come. When I got home last night Mina had supper ready, andwhen we had supped she told me of Van Helsing’s visit, and of her havinggiven him the two diaries copied out, and of how anxious she has beenabout me. She showed me in the doctor’s letter that all I wrote down wastrue. It seems to have made a new man of me. It was the doubt as to thereality of the whole thing that knocked me over. I felt impotent, and inthe dark, and distrustful. But, now that I _know_, I am not afraid, evenof the Count. He has succeeded after all, then, in his design in gettingto London, and it was he I saw. He has got younger, and how? Van Helsingis the man to unmask him and hunt him out, if he is anything like whatMina says. We sat late, and talked it all over. Mina is dressing, and Ishall call at the hotel in a few minutes and bring him over....He was, I think, surprised to see me. When I came into the room where hewas, and introduced myself, he took me by the shoulder, and turned myface round to the light, and said, after a sharp scrutiny:--“But Madam Mina told me you were ill, that you had had a shock.” It wasso funny to hear my wife called “Madam Mina” by this kindly,strong-faced old man. I smiled, and said:--“I _was_ ill, I _have_ had a shock; but you have cured me already.”“And how?”“By your letter to Mina last night. I was in doubt, and then everythingtook a hue of unreality, and I did not know what to trust, even theevidence of my own senses. Not knowing what to trust, I did not knowwhat to do; and so had only to keep on working in what had hitherto beenthe groove of my life. The groove ceased to avail me, and I mistrustedmyself. Doctor, you don’t know what it is to doubt everything, evenyourself. No, you don’t; you couldn’t with eyebrows like yours.” Heseemed pleased, and laughed as he said:--“So! You are physiognomist. I learn more here with each hour. I am withso much pleasure coming to you to breakfast; and, oh, sir, you willpardon praise from an old man, but you are blessed in your wife.” Iwould listen to him go on praising Mina for a day, so I simply noddedand stood silent.“She is one of God’s women, fashioned by His own hand to show us men andother women that there is a heaven where we can enter, and that itslight can be here on earth. So true, so sweet, so noble, so little anegoist--and that, let me tell you, is much in this age, so sceptical andselfish. And you, sir--I have read all the letters to poor Miss Lucy,and some of them speak of you, so I know you since some days from theknowing of others; but I have seen your true self since last night. Youwill give me your hand, will you not? And let us be friends for all ourlives.”We shook hands, and he was so earnest and so kind that it made me quitechoky.“And now,” he said, “may I ask you for some more help? I have a greattask to do, and at the beginning it is to know. You can help me here.Can you tell me what went before your going to Transylvania? Later on Imay ask more help, and of a different kind; but at first this will do.”“Look here, sir,” I said, “does what you have to do concern the Count?”“It does,” he said solemnly.“Then I am with you heart and soul. As you go by the 10:30 train, youwill not have time to read them; but I shall get the bundle of papers.You can take them with you and read them in the train.”After breakfast I saw him to the station. When we were parting hesaid:--“Perhaps you will come to town if I send to you, and take Madam Minatoo.”“We shall both come when you will,” I said.I had got him the morning papers and the London papers of the previousnight, and while we were talking at the carriage window, waiting for thetrain to start, he was turning them over. His eyes suddenly seemed tocatch something in one of them, “The Westminster Gazette”--I knew it bythe colour--and he grew quite white. He read something intently,groaning to himself: “Mein Gott! Mein Gott! So soon! so soon!” I do notthink he remembered me at the moment. Just then the whistle blew, andthe train moved off. This recalled him to himself, and he leaned out ofthe window and waved his hand, calling out: “Love to Madam Mina; I shallwrite so soon as ever I can.”_Dr. Seward’s Diary.__26 September._--Truly there is no such thing as finality. Not a weeksince I said “Finis,” and yet here I am starting fresh again, or rathergoing on with the same record. Until this afternoon I had no cause tothink of what is done. Renfield had become, to all intents, as sane ashe ever was. He was already well ahead with his fly business; and he hadjust started in the spider line also; so he had not been of any troubleto me. I had a letter from Arthur, written on Sunday, and from it Igather that he is bearing up wonderfully well. Quincey Morris is withhim, and that is much of a help, for he himself is a bubbling well ofgood spirits. Quincey wrote me a line too, and from him I hear thatArthur is beginning to recover something of his old buoyancy; so as tothem all my mind is at rest. As for myself, I was settling down to mywork with the enthusiasm which I used to have for it, so that I mightfairly have said that the wound which poor Lucy left on me was becomingcicatrised. Everything is, however, now reopened; and what is to be theend God only knows. I have an idea that Van Helsing thinks he knows,too, but he will only let out enough at a time to whet curiosity. Hewent to Exeter yesterday, and stayed there all night. To-day he cameback, and almost bounded into the room at about half-past five o’clock,and thrust last night’s “Westminster Gazette” into my hand.“What do you think of that?” he asked as he stood back and folded hisarms.I looked over the paper, for I really did not know what he meant; but hetook it from me and pointed out a paragraph about children being decoyedaway at Hampstead. It did not convey much to me, until I reached apassage where it described small punctured wounds on their throats. Anidea struck me, and I looked up. “Well?” he said.“It is like poor Lucy’s.”“And what do you make of it?”“Simply that there is some cause in common. Whatever it was that injuredher has injured them.” I did not quite understand his answer:--“That is true indirectly, but not directly.”“How do you mean, Professor?” I asked. I was a little inclined to takehis seriousness lightly--for, after all, four days of rest and freedomfrom burning, harrowing anxiety does help to restore one’s spirits--butwhen I saw his face, it sobered me. Never, even in the midst of ourdespair about poor Lucy, had he looked more stern.“Tell me!” I said. “I can hazard no opinion. I do not know what tothink, and I have no data on which to found a conjecture.”“Do you mean to tell me, friend John, that you have no suspicion as towhat poor Lucy died of; not after all the hints given, not only byevents, but by me?”“Of nervous prostration following on great loss or waste of blood.”“And how the blood lost or waste?” I shook my head. He stepped over andsat down beside me, and went on:--“You are clever man, friend John; you reason well, and your wit is bold;but you are too prejudiced. You do not let your eyes see nor your earshear, and that which is outside your daily life is not of account toyou. Do you not think that there are things which you cannot understand,and yet which are; that some people see things that others cannot? Butthere are things old and new which must not be contemplate by men’seyes, because they know--or think they know--some things which other menhave told them. Ah, it is the fault of our science that it wants toexplain all; and if it explain not, then it says there is nothing toexplain. But yet we see around us every day the growth of new beliefs,which think themselves new; and which are yet but the old, which pretendto be young--like the fine ladies at the opera. I suppose now you do notbelieve in corporeal transference. No? Nor in materialisation. No? Norin astral bodies. No? Nor in the reading of thought. No? Nor inhypnotism----”“Yes,” I said. “Charcot has proved that pretty well.” He smiled as hewent on: “Then you are satisfied as to it. Yes? And of course then youunderstand how it act, and can follow the mind of the greatCharcot--alas that he is no more!--into the very soul of the patientthat he influence. No? Then, friend John, am I to take it that yousimply accept fact, and are satisfied to let from premise to conclusionbe a blank? No? Then tell me--for I am student of the brain--how youaccept the hypnotism and reject the thought reading. Let me tell you, myfriend, that there are things done to-day in electrical science whichwould have been deemed unholy by the very men who discoveredelectricity--who would themselves not so long before have been burnedas wizards. There are always mysteries in life. Why was it thatMethuselah lived nine hundred years, and ‘Old Parr’ one hundred andsixty-nine, and yet that poor Lucy, with four men’s blood in her poorveins, could not live even one day? For, had she live one more day, wecould have save her. Do you know all the mystery of life and death? Doyou know the altogether of comparative anatomy and can say wherefore thequalities of brutes are in some men, and not in others? Can you tell mewhy, when other spiders die small and soon, that one great spider livedfor centuries in the tower of the old Spanish church and grew and grew,till, on descending, he could drink the oil of all the church lamps? Canyou tell me why in the Pampas, ay and elsewhere, there are bats thatcome at night and open the veins of cattle and horses and suck dry theirveins; how in some islands of the Western seas there are bats which hangon the trees all day, and those who have seen describe as like giantnuts or pods, and that when the sailors sleep on the deck, because thatit is hot, flit down on them, and then--and then in the morning arefound dead men, white as even Miss Lucy was?”“Good God, Professor!” I said, starting up. “Do you mean to tell me thatLucy was bitten by such a bat; and that such a thing is here in Londonin the nineteenth century?” He waved his hand for silence, and wenton:--“Can you tell me why the tortoise lives more long than generations ofmen; why the elephant goes on and on till he have seen dynasties; andwhy the parrot never die only of bite of cat or dog or other complaint?Can you tell me why men believe in all ages and places that there aresome few who live on always if they be permit; that there are men andwomen who cannot die? We all know--because science has vouched for thefact--that there have been toads shut up in rocks for thousands ofyears, shut in one so small hole that only hold him since the youth ofthe world. Can you tell me how the Indian fakir can make himself to dieand have been buried, and his grave sealed and corn sowed on it, and thecorn reaped and be cut and sown and reaped and cut again, and then mencome and take away the unbroken seal and that there lie the Indianfakir, not dead, but that rise up and walk amongst them as before?” HereI interrupted him. I was getting bewildered; he so crowded on my mindhis list of nature’s eccentricities and possible impossibilities that myimagination was getting fired. I had a dim idea that he was teaching mesome lesson, as long ago he used to do in his study at Amsterdam; buthe used then to tell me the thing, so that I could have the object ofthought in mind all the time. But now I was without this help, yet Iwanted to follow him, so I said:--“Professor, let me be your pet student again. Tell me the thesis, sothat I may apply your knowledge as you go on. At present I am going inmy mind from point to point as a mad man, and not a sane one, follows anidea. I feel like a novice lumbering through a bog in a mist, jumpingfrom one tussock to another in the mere blind effort to move on withoutknowing where I am going.”“That is good image,” he said. “Well, I shall tell you. My thesis isthis: I want you to believe.”“To believe what?”“To believe in things that you cannot. Let me illustrate. I heard onceof an American who so defined faith: ‘that faculty which enables us tobelieve things which we know to be untrue.’ For one, I follow that man.He meant that we shall have an open mind, and not let a little bit oftruth check the rush of a big truth, like a small rock does a railwaytruck. We get the small truth first. Good! We keep him, and we valuehim; but all the same we must not let him think himself all the truth inthe universe.”“Then you want me not to let some previous conviction injure thereceptivity of my mind with regard to some strange matter. Do I readyour lesson aright?”“Ah, you are my favourite pupil still. It is worth to teach you. Nowthat you are willing to understand, you have taken the first step tounderstand. You think then that those so small holes in the children’sthroats were made by the same that made the hole in Miss Lucy?”“I suppose so.” He stood up and said solemnly:--“Then you are wrong. Oh, would it were so! but alas! no. It is worse,far, far worse.”“In God’s name, Professor Van Helsing, what do you mean?” I cried.He threw himself with a despairing gesture into a chair, and placed hiselbows on the table, covering his face with his hands as he spoke:--“They were made by Miss Lucy!”CHAPTER XVDR. SEWARD’S DIARY--_continued_.For a while sheer anger mastered me; it was as if he had during her lifestruck Lucy on the face. I smote the table hard and rose up as I said tohim:--“Dr. Van Helsing, are you mad?” He raised his head and looked at me, andsomehow the tenderness of his face calmed me at once. “Would I were!” hesaid. “Madness were easy to bear compared with truth like this. Oh, myfriend, why, think you, did I go so far round, why take so long to tellyou so simple a thing? Was it because I hate you and have hated you allmy life? Was it because I wished to give you pain? Was it that I wanted,now so late, revenge for that time when you saved my life, and from afearful death? Ah no!”“Forgive me,” said I. He went on:--“My friend, it was because I wished to be gentle in the breaking to you,for I know you have loved that so sweet lady. But even yet I do notexpect you to believe. It is so hard to accept at once any abstracttruth, that we may doubt such to be possible when we have alwaysbelieved the ‘no’ of it; it is more hard still to accept so sad aconcrete truth, and of such a one as Miss Lucy. To-night I go to proveit. Dare you come with me?”This staggered me. A man does not like to prove such a truth; Byronexcepted from the category, jealousy.“And prove the very truth he most abhorred.”He saw my hesitation, and spoke:--“The logic is simple, no madman’s logic this time, jumping from tussockto tussock in a misty bog. If it be not true, then proof will be relief;at worst it will not harm. If it be true! Ah, there is the dread; yetvery dread should help my cause, for in it is some need of belief. Come,I tell you what I propose: first, that we go off now and see that childin the hospital. Dr. Vincent, of the North Hospital, where the paperssay the child is, is friend of mine, and I think of yours since you werein class at Amsterdam. He will let two scientists see his case, if hewill not let two friends. We shall tell him nothing, but only that wewish to learn. And then----”“And then?” He took a key from his pocket and held it up. “And then wespend the night, you and I, in the churchyard where Lucy lies. This isthe key that lock the tomb. I had it from the coffin-man to give toArthur.” My heart sank within me, for I felt that there was some fearfulordeal before us. I could do nothing, however, so I plucked up whatheart I could and said that we had better hasten, as the afternoon waspassing....We found the child awake. It had had a sleep and taken some food, andaltogether was going on well. Dr. Vincent took the bandage from itsthroat, and showed us the punctures. There was no mistaking thesimilarity to those which had been on Lucy’s throat. They were smaller,and the edges looked fresher; that was all. We asked Vincent to what heattributed them, and he replied that it must have been a bite of someanimal, perhaps a rat; but, for his own part, he was inclined to thinkthat it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northernheights of London. “Out of so many harmless ones,” he said, “there maybe some wild specimen from the South of a more malignant species. Somesailor may have brought one home, and it managed to escape; or even fromthe Zoölogical Gardens a young one may have got loose, or one be bredthere from a vampire. These things do occur, you know. Only ten days agoa wolf got out, and was, I believe, traced up in this direction. For aweek after, the children were playing nothing but Red Riding Hood on theHeath and in every alley in the place until this ‘bloofer lady’ scarecame along, since when it has been quite a gala-time with them. Eventhis poor little mite, when he woke up to-day, asked the nurse if hemight go away. When she asked him why he wanted to go, he said he wantedto play with the ‘bloofer lady.’”“I hope,” said Van Helsing, “that when you are sending the child homeyou will caution its parents to keep strict watch over it. These fanciesto stray are most dangerous; and if the child were to remain out anothernight, it would probably be fatal. But in any case I suppose you willnot let it away for some days?”“Certainly not, not for a week at least; longer if the wound is nothealed.”Our visit to the hospital took more time than we had reckoned on, andthe sun had dipped before we came out. When Van Helsing saw how dark itwas, he said:--“There is no hurry. It is more late than I thought. Come, let us seeksomewhere that we may eat, and then we shall go on our way.”We dined at “Jack Straw’s Castle” along with a little crowd ofbicyclists and others who were genially noisy. About ten o’clock westarted from the inn. It was then very dark, and the scattered lampsmade the darkness greater when we were once outside their individualradius. The Professor had evidently noted the road we were to go, for hewent on unhesitatingly; but, as for me, I was in quite a mixup as tolocality. As we went further, we met fewer and fewer people, till atlast we were somewhat surprised when we met even the patrol of horsepolice going their usual suburban round. At last we reached the wall ofthe churchyard, which we climbed over. With some little difficulty--forit was very dark, and the whole place seemed so strange to us--we foundthe Westenra tomb. The Professor took the key, opened the creaky door,and standing back, politely, but quite unconsciously, motioned me toprecede him. There was a delicious irony in the offer, in thecourtliness of giving preference on such a ghastly occasion. Mycompanion followed me quickly, and cautiously drew the door to, aftercarefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling, and not a spring,one. In the latter case we should have been in a bad plight. Then hefumbled in his bag, and taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle,proceeded to make a light. The tomb in the day-time, and when wreathedwith fresh flowers, had looked grim and gruesome enough; but now, somedays afterwards, when the flowers hung lank and dead, their whitesturning to rust and their greens to browns; when the spider and thebeetle had resumed their accustomed dominance; when time-discolouredstone, and dust-encrusted mortar, and rusty, dank iron, and tarnishedbrass, and clouded silver-plating gave back the feeble glimmer of acandle, the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have beenimagined. It conveyed irresistibly the idea that life--animal life--wasnot the only thing which could pass away.Van Helsing went about his work systematically. Holding his candle sothat he could read the coffin plates, and so holding it that the spermdropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal, hemade assurance of Lucy’s coffin. Another search in his bag, and he tookout a turnscrew.“What are you going to do?” I asked.“To open the coffin. You shall yet be convinced.” Straightway he begantaking out the screws, and finally lifted off the lid, showing thecasing of lead beneath. The sight was almost too much for me. It seemedto be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to havestripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living; I actually tookhold of his hand to stop him. He only said: “You shall see,” and againfumbling in his bag, took out a tiny fret-saw. Striking the turnscrewthrough the lead with a swift downward stab, which made me wince, hemade a small hole, which was, however, big enough to admit the point ofthe saw. I had expected a rush of gas from the week-old corpse. Wedoctors, who have had to study our dangers, have to become accustomed tosuch things, and I drew back towards the door. But the Professor neverstopped for a moment; he sawed down a couple of feet along one side ofthe lead coffin, and then across, and down the other side. Taking theedge of the loose flange, he bent it back towards the foot of thecoffin, and holding up the candle into the aperture, motioned to me tolook.I drew near and looked. The coffin was empty.It was certainly a surprise to me, and gave me a considerable shock, butVan Helsing was unmoved. He was now more sure than ever of his ground,and so emboldened to proceed in his task. “Are you satisfied now, friendJohn?” he asked.I felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within me asI answered him:--“I am satisfied that Lucy’s body is not in that coffin; but that onlyproves one thing.”“And what is that, friend John?”“That it is not there.”“That is good logic,” he said, “so far as it goes. But how do you--howcan you--account for it not being there?”“Perhaps a body-snatcher,” I suggested. “Some of the undertaker’s peoplemay have stolen it.” I felt that I was speaking folly, and yet it wasthe only real cause which I could suggest. The Professor sighed. “Ahwell!” he said, “we must have more proof. Come with me.”He put on the coffin-lid again, gathered up all his things and placedthem in the bag, blew out the light, and placed the candle also in thebag. We opened the door, and went out. Behind us he closed the door andlocked it. He handed me the key, saying: “Will you keep it? You hadbetter be assured.” I laughed--it was not a very cheerful laugh, I ambound to say--as I motioned him to keep it. “A key is nothing,” I said;“there may be duplicates; and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lockof that kind.” He said nothing, but put the key in his pocket. Then hetold me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he would watch atthe other. I took up my place behind a yew-tree, and I saw his darkfigure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from mysight.It was a lonely vigil. Just after I had taken my place I heard a distantclock strike twelve, and in time came one and two. I was chilled andunnerved, and angry with the Professor for taking me on such an errandand with myself for coming. I was too cold and too sleepy to be keenlyobservant, and not sleepy enough to betray my trust so altogether I hada dreary, miserable time.Suddenly, as I turned round, I thought I saw something like a whitestreak, moving between two dark yew-trees at the side of the churchyardfarthest from the tomb; at the same time a dark mass moved from theProfessor’s side of the ground, and hurriedly went towards it. Then Itoo moved; but I had to go round headstones and railed-off tombs, and Istumbled over graves. The sky was overcast, and somewhere far off anearly cock crew. A little way off, beyond a line of scatteredjuniper-trees, which marked the pathway to the church, a white, dimfigure flitted in the direction of the tomb. The tomb itself was hiddenby trees, and I could not see where the figure disappeared. I heard therustle of actual movement where I had first seen the white figure, andcoming over, found the Professor holding in his arms a tiny child. Whenhe saw me he held it out to me, and said:--“Are you satisfied now?”“No,” I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive.“Do you not see the child?”“Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here? And is it wounded?” Iasked.“We shall see,” said the Professor, and with one impulse we took our wayout of the churchyard, he carrying the sleeping child.When we had got some little distance away, we went into a clump oftrees, and struck a match, and looked at the child’s throat. It waswithout a scratch or scar of any kind.“Was I right?” I asked triumphantly.“We were just in time,” said the Professor thankfully.We had now to decide what we were to do with the child, and so consultedabout it. If we were to take it to a police-station we should have togive some account of our movements during the night; at least, we shouldhave had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child.So finally we decided that we would take it to the Heath, and when weheard a policeman coming, would leave it where he could not fail to findit; we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could. All fell outwell. At the edge of Hampstead Heath we heard a policeman’s heavytramp, and laying the child on the pathway, we waited and watched untilhe saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro. We heard his exclamationof astonishment, and then we went away silently. By good chance we got acab near the “Spaniards,” and drove to town.I cannot sleep, so I make this entry. But I must try to get a few hours’sleep, as Van Helsing is to call for me at noon. He insists that I shallgo with him on another expedition.*       *       *       *       *_27 September._--It was two o’clock before we found a suitableopportunity for our attempt. The funeral held at noon was all completed,and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazilyaway, when, looking carefully from behind a clump of alder-trees, we sawthe sexton lock the gate after him. We knew then that we were safe tillmorning did we desire it; but the Professor told me that we should notwant more than an hour at most. Again I felt that horrid sense of thereality of things, in which any effort of imagination seemed out ofplace; and I realised distinctly the perils of the law which we wereincurring in our unhallowed work. Besides, I felt it was all so useless.Outrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin, to see if a woman deadnearly a week were really dead, it now seemed the height of folly toopen the tomb again, when we knew, from the evidence of our owneyesight, that the coffin was empty. I shrugged my shoulders, however,and rested silent, for Van Helsing had a way of going on his own road,no matter who remonstrated. He took the key, opened the vault, and againcourteously motioned me to precede. The place was not so gruesome aslast night, but oh, how unutterably mean-looking when the sunshinestreamed in. Van Helsing walked over to Lucy’s coffin, and I followed.He bent over and again forced back the leaden flange; and then a shockof surprise and dismay shot through me.There lay Lucy, seemingly just as we had seen her the night before herfuneral. She was, if possible, more radiantly beautiful than ever; and Icould not believe that she was dead. The lips were red, nay redder thanbefore; and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom.“Is this a juggle?” I said to him.“Are you convinced now?” said the Professor in response, and as he spokehe put over his hand, and in a way that made me shudder, pulled back thedead lips and showed the white teeth.“See,” he went on, “see, they are even sharper than before. With thisand this”--and he touched one of the canine teeth and that belowit--“the little children can be bitten. Are you of belief now, friendJohn?” Once more, argumentative hostility woke within me. I _could_ notaccept such an overwhelming idea as he suggested; so, with an attempt toargue of which I was even at the moment ashamed, I said:--“She may have been placed here since last night.”“Indeed? That is so, and by whom?”“I do not know. Some one has done it.”“And yet she has been dead one week. Most peoples in that time would notlook so.” I had no answer for this, so was silent. Van Helsing did notseem to notice my silence; at any rate, he showed neither chagrin nortriumph. He was looking intently at the face of the dead woman, raisingthe eyelids and looking at the eyes, and once more opening the lips andexamining the teeth. Then he turned to me and said:--“Here, there is one thing which is different from all recorded; here issome dual life that is not as the common. She was bitten by the vampirewhen she was in a trance, sleep-walking--oh, you start; you do not knowthat, friend John, but you shall know it all later--and in trance couldhe best come to take more blood. In trance she died, and in trance sheis Un-Dead, too. So it is that she differ from all other. Usually whenthe Un-Dead sleep at home”--as he spoke he made a comprehensive sweep ofhis arm to designate what to a vampire was “home”--“their face show whatthey are, but this so sweet that was when she not Un-Dead she go back tothe nothings of the common dead. There is no malign there, see, and soit make hard that I must kill her in her sleep.” This turned my bloodcold, and it began to dawn upon me that I was accepting Van Helsing’stheories; but if she were really dead, what was there of terror in theidea of killing her? He looked up at me, and evidently saw the change inmy face, for he said almost joyously:--“Ah, you believe now?”I answered: “Do not press me too hard all at once. I am willing toaccept. How will you do this bloody work?”“I shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic, and I shalldrive a stake through her body.” It made me shudder to think of somutilating the body of the woman whom I had loved. And yet the feelingwas not so strong as I had expected. I was, in fact, beginning toshudder at the presence of this being, this Un-Dead, as Van Helsingcalled it, and to loathe it. Is it possible that love is all subjective,or all objective?I waited a considerable time for Van Helsing to begin, but he stood asif wrapped in thought. Presently he closed the catch of his bag with asnap, and said:--“I have been thinking, and have made up my mind as to what is best. If Idid simply follow my inclining I would do now, at this moment, what isto be done; but there are other things to follow, and things that arethousand times more difficult in that them we do not know. This issimple. She have yet no life taken, though that is of time; and to actnow would be to take danger from her for ever. But then we may have towant Arthur, and how shall we tell him of this? If you, who saw thewounds on Lucy’s throat, and saw the wounds so similar on the child’s atthe hospital; if you, who saw the coffin empty last night and fullto-day with a woman who have not change only to be more rose and morebeautiful in a whole week, after she die--if you know of this and knowof the white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyard,and yet of your own senses you did not believe, how, then, can I expectArthur, who know none of those things, to believe? He doubted me when Itook him from her kiss when she was dying. I know he has forgiven mebecause in some mistaken idea I have done things that prevent him saygood-bye as he ought; and he may think that in some more mistaken ideathis woman was buried alive; and that in most mistake of all we havekilled her. He will then argue back that it is we, mistaken ones, thathave killed her by our ideas; and so he will be much unhappy always. Yethe never can be sure; and that is the worst of all. And he willsometimes think that she he loved was buried alive, and that will painthis dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered; and again, hewill think that we may be right, and that his so beloved was, after all,an Un-Dead. No! I told him once, and since then I learn much. Now, sinceI know it is all true, a hundred thousand times more do I know that hemust pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet. He, poor fellow,must have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow black tohim; then we can act for good all round and send him peace. My mind ismade up. Let us go. You return home for to-night to your asylum, and seethat all be well. As for me, I shall spend the night here in thischurchyard in my own way. To-morrow night you will come to me to theBerkeley Hotel at ten of the clock. I shall send for Arthur to come too,and also that so fine young man of America that gave his blood. Later weshall all have work to do. I come with you so far as Piccadilly andthere dine, for I must be back here before the sun set.”So we locked the tomb and came away, and got over the wall of thechurchyard, which was not much of a task, and drove back to Piccadilly._Note left by Van Helsing in his portmanteau, Berkeley Hotel directed toJohn Seward, M. D._(Not delivered.)“_27 September._“Friend John,--“I write this in case anything should happen. I go alone to watch inthat churchyard. It pleases me that the Un-Dead, Miss Lucy, shall notleave to-night, that so on the morrow night she may be more eager.Therefore I shall fix some things she like not--garlic and acrucifix--and so seal up the door of the tomb. She is young as Un-Dead,and will heed. Moreover, these are only to prevent her coming out; theymay not prevail on her wanting to get in; for then the Un-Dead isdesperate, and must find the line of least resistance, whatsoever it maybe. I shall be at hand all the night from sunset till after the sunrise,and if there be aught that may be learned I shall learn it. For MissLucy or from her, I have no fear; but that other to whom is there thatshe is Un-Dead, he have now the power to seek her tomb and find shelter.He is cunning, as I know from Mr. Jonathan and from the way that allalong he have fooled us when he played with us for Miss Lucy’s life, andwe lost; and in many ways the Un-Dead are strong. He have always thestrength in his hand of twenty men; even we four who gave our strengthto Miss Lucy it also is all to him. Besides, he can summon his wolf andI know not what. So if it be that he come thither on this night he shallfind me; but none other shall--until it be too late. But it may be thathe will not attempt the place. There is no reason why he should; hishunting ground is more full of game than the churchyard where theUn-Dead woman sleep, and the one old man watch.“Therefore I write this in case.... Take the papers that are with this,the diaries of Harker and the rest, and read them, and then find thisgreat Un-Dead, and cut off his head and burn his heart or drive a stakethrough it, so that the world may rest from him.“If it be so, farewell.“VAN HELSING.”_Dr. Seward’s Diary.__28 September._--It is wonderful what a good night’s sleep will do forone. Yesterday I was almost willing to accept Van Helsing’s monstrousideas; but now they seem to start out lurid before me as outrages oncommon sense. I have no doubt that he believes it all. I wonder if hismind can have become in any way unhinged. Surely there must be _some_rational explanation of all these mysterious things. Is it possible thatthe Professor can have done it himself? He is so abnormally clever thatif he went off his head he would carry out his intent with regard tosome fixed idea in a wonderful way. I am loath to think it, and indeedit would be almost as great a marvel as the other to find that VanHelsing was mad; but anyhow I shall watch him carefully. I may get somelight on the mystery.*       *       *       *       *_29 September, morning._.... Last night, at a little before ten o’clock,Arthur and Quincey came into Van Helsing’s room; he told us all that hewanted us to do, but especially addressing himself to Arthur, as if allour wills were centred in his. He began by saying that he hoped we wouldall come with him too, “for,” he said, “there is a grave duty to be donethere. You were doubtless surprised at my letter?” This query wasdirectly addressed to Lord Godalming.“I was. It rather upset me for a bit. There has been so much troublearound my house of late that I could do without any more. I have beencurious, too, as to what you mean. Quincey and I talked it over; but themore we talked, the more puzzled we got, till now I can say for myselfthat I’m about up a tree as to any meaning about anything.”“Me too,” said Quincey Morris laconically.“Oh,” said the Professor, “then you are nearer the beginning, both ofyou, than friend John here, who has to go a long way back before he caneven get so far as to begin.”It was evident that he recognised my return to my old doubting frame ofmind without my saying a word. Then, turning to the other two, he saidwith intense gravity:--“I want your permission to do what I think good this night. It is, Iknow, much to ask; and when you know what it is I propose to do you willknow, and only then, how much. Therefore may I ask that you promise mein the dark, so that afterwards, though you may be angry with me for atime--I must not disguise from myself the possibility that such maybe--you shall not blame yourselves for anything.”“That’s frank anyhow,” broke in Quincey. “I’ll answer for the Professor.I don’t quite see his drift, but I swear he’s honest; and that’s goodenough for me.”“I thank you, sir,” said Van Helsing proudly. “I have done myself thehonour of counting you one trusting friend, and such endorsement is dearto me.” He held out a hand, which Quincey took.Then Arthur spoke out:--“Dr. Van Helsing, I don’t quite like to ‘buy a pig in a poke,’ as theysay in Scotland, and if it be anything in which my honour as a gentlemanor my faith as a Christian is concerned, I cannot make such a promise.If you can assure me that what you intend does not violate either ofthese two, then I give my consent at once; though for the life of me, Icannot understand what you are driving at.”“I accept your limitation,” said Van Helsing, “and all I ask of you isthat if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine, you will firstconsider it well and be satisfied that it does not violate yourreservations.”“Agreed!” said Arthur; “that is only fair. And now that the_pourparlers_ are over, may I ask what it is we are to do?”“I want you to come with me, and to come in secret, to the churchyard atKingstead.”Arthur’s face fell as he said in an amazed sort of way:--“Where poor Lucy is buried?” The Professor bowed. Arthur went on: “Andwhen there?”“To enter the tomb!” Arthur stood up.“Professor, are you in earnest; or it is some monstrous joke? Pardon me,I see that you are in earnest.” He sat down again, but I could see thathe sat firmly and proudly, as one who is on his dignity. There wassilence until he asked again:--“And when in the tomb?”“To open the coffin.”“This is too much!” he said, angrily rising again. “I am willing to bepatient in all things that are reasonable; but in this--this desecrationof the grave--of one who----” He fairly choked with indignation. TheProfessor looked pityingly at him.“If I could spare you one pang, my poor friend,” he said, “God knows Iwould. But this night our feet must tread in thorny paths; or later, andfor ever, the feet you love must walk in paths of flame!”Arthur looked up with set white face and said:--“Take care, sir, take care!”“Would it not be well to hear what I have to say?” said Van Helsing.“And then you will at least know the limit of my purpose. Shall I goon?”“That’s fair enough,” broke in Morris.After a pause Van Helsing went on, evidently with an effort:--“Miss Lucy is dead; is it not so? Yes! Then there can be no wrong toher. But if she be not dead----”Arthur jumped to his feet.“Good God!” he cried. “What do you mean? Has there been any mistake; hasshe been buried alive?” He groaned in anguish that not even hope couldsoften.“I did not say she was alive, my child; I did not think it. I go nofurther than to say that she might be Un-Dead.”“Un-Dead! Not alive! What do you mean? Is this all a nightmare, or whatis it?”“There are mysteries which men can only guess at, which age by age theymay solve only in part. Believe me, we are now on the verge of one. ButI have not done. May I cut off the head of dead Miss Lucy?”“Heavens and earth, no!” cried Arthur in a storm of passion. “Not forthe wide world will I consent to any mutilation of her dead body. Dr.Van Helsing, you try me too far. What have I done to you that you shouldtorture me so? What did that poor, sweet girl do that you should want tocast such dishonour on her grave? Are you mad to speak such things, oram I mad to listen to them? Don’t dare to think more of such adesecration; I shall not give my consent to anything you do. I have aduty to do in protecting her grave from outrage; and, by God, I shall doit!”Van Helsing rose up from where he had all the time been seated, andsaid, gravely and sternly:--“My Lord Godalming, I, too, have a duty to do, a duty to others, a dutyto you, a duty to the dead; and, by God, I shall do it! All I ask younow is that you come with me, that you look and listen; and if whenlater I make the same request you do not be more eager for itsfulfilment even than I am, then--then I shall do my duty, whatever itmay seem to me. And then, to follow of your Lordship’s wishes I shallhold myself at your disposal to render an account to you, when and whereyou will.” His voice broke a little, and he went on with a voice full ofpity:--“But, I beseech you, do not go forth in anger with me. In a long life ofacts which were often not pleasant to do, and which sometimes did wringmy heart, I have never had so heavy a task as now. Believe me that ifthe time comes for you to change your mind towards me, one look fromyou will wipe away all this so sad hour, for I would do what a man canto save you from sorrow. Just think. For why should I give myself somuch of labour and so much of sorrow? I have come here from my own landto do what I can of good; at the first to please my friend John, andthen to help a sweet young lady, whom, too, I came to love. For her--Iam ashamed to say so much, but I say it in kindness--I gave what yougave; the blood of my veins; I gave it, I, who was not, like you, herlover, but only her physician and her friend. I gave to her my nightsand days--before death, after death; and if my death can do her goodeven now, when she is the dead Un-Dead, she shall have it freely.” Hesaid this with a very grave, sweet pride, and Arthur was much affectedby it. He took the old man’s hand and said in a broken voice:--“Oh, it is hard to think of it, and I cannot understand; but at least Ishall go with you and wait.”CHAPTER XVIDR. SEWARD’S DIARY--_continued_It was just a quarter before twelve o’clock when we got into thechurchyard over the low wall. The night was dark with occasional gleamsof moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that scudded acrossthe sky. We all kept somehow close together, with Van Helsing slightlyin front as he led the way. When we had come close to the tomb I lookedwell at Arthur, for I feared that the proximity to a place laden with sosorrowful a memory would upset him; but he bore himself well. I took itthat the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way a counteractantto his grief. The Professor unlocked the door, and seeing a naturalhesitation amongst us for various reasons, solved the difficulty byentering first himself. The rest of us followed, and he closed the door.He then lit a dark lantern and pointed to the coffin. Arthur steppedforward hesitatingly; Van Helsing said to me:--“You were with me here yesterday. Was the body of Miss Lucy in thatcoffin?”“It was.” The Professor turned to the rest saying:--“You hear; and yet there is no one who does not believe with me.” Hetook his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin. Arthurlooked on, very pale but silent; when the lid was removed he steppedforward. He evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin, or,at any rate, had not thought of it. When he saw the rent in the lead,the blood rushed to his face for an instant, but as quickly fell awayagain, so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness; he was still silent.Van Helsing forced back the leaden flange, and we all looked in andrecoiled.The coffin was empty!For several minutes no one spoke a word. The silence was broken byQuincey Morris:--“Professor, I answered for you. Your word is all I want. I wouldn’t asksuch a thing ordinarily--I wouldn’t so dishonour you as to imply adoubt; but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour.Is this your doing?”“I swear to you by all that I hold sacred that I have not removed nortouched her. What happened was this: Two nights ago my friend Seward andI came here--with good purpose, believe me. I opened that coffin, whichwas then sealed up, and we found it, as now, empty. We then waited, andsaw something white come through the trees. The next day we came here inday-time, and she lay there. Did she not, friend John?”“Yes.”“That night we were just in time. One more so small child was missing,and we find it, thank God, unharmed amongst the graves. Yesterday I camehere before sundown, for at sundown the Un-Dead can move. I waited hereall the night till the sun rose, but I saw nothing. It was most probablethat it was because I had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic,which the Un-Dead cannot bear, and other things which they shun. Lastnight there was no exodus, so to-night before the sundown I took away mygarlic and other things. And so it is we find this coffin empty. Butbear with me. So far there is much that is strange. Wait you with meoutside, unseen and unheard, and things much stranger are yet to be.So”--here he shut the dark slide of his lantern--“now to the outside.”He opened the door, and we filed out, he coming last and locking thedoor behind him.Oh! but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror ofthat vault. How sweet it was to see the clouds race by, and the passinggleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing andpassing--like the gladness and sorrow of a man’s life; how sweet it wasto breathe the fresh air, that had no taint of death and decay; howhumanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill, and tohear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a great city. Eachin his own way was solemn and overcome. Arthur was silent, and was, Icould see, striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of themystery. I was myself tolerably patient, and half inclined again tothrow aside doubt and to accept Van Helsing’s conclusions. QuinceyMorris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things, andaccepts them in the spirit of cool bravery, with hazard of all he has tostake. Not being able to smoke, he cut himself a good-sized plug oftobacco and began to chew. As to Van Helsing, he was employed in adefinite way. First he took from his bag a mass of what looked likethin, wafer-like biscuit, which was carefully rolled up in a whitenapkin; next he took out a double-handful of some whitish stuff, likedough or putty. He crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into themass between his hands. This he then took, and rolling it into thinstrips, began to lay them into the crevices between the door and itssetting in the tomb. I was somewhat puzzled at this, and being close,asked him what it was that he was doing. Arthur and Quincey drew nearalso, as they too were curious. He answered:--“I am closing the tomb, so that the Un-Dead may not enter.”“And is that stuff you have put there going to do it?” asked Quincey.“Great Scott! Is this a game?”“It is.”“What is that which you are using?” This time the question was byArthur. Van Helsing reverently lifted his hat as he answered:--“The Host. I brought it from Amsterdam. I have an Indulgence.” It was ananswer that appalled the most sceptical of us, and we felt individuallythat in the presence of such earnest purpose as the Professor’s, apurpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of things, it wasimpossible to distrust. In respectful silence we took the placesassigned to us close round the tomb, but hidden from the sight of anyone approaching. I pitied the others, especially Arthur. I had myselfbeen apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror; and yet I,who had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs, felt my heart sinkwithin me. Never did tombs look so ghastly white; never did cypress, oryew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of funereal gloom; never did treeor grass wave or rustle so ominously; never did bough creak somysteriously; and never did the far-away howling of dogs send such awoeful presage through the night.There was a long spell of silence, a big, aching void, and then from theProfessor a keen “S-s-s-s!” He pointed; and far down the avenue of yewswe saw a white figure advance--a dim white figure, which held somethingdark at its breast. The figure stopped, and at the moment a ray ofmoonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds and showed in startlingprominence a dark-haired woman, dressed in the cerements of the grave.We could not see the face, for it was bent down over what we saw to be afair-haired child. There was a pause and a sharp little cry, such as achild gives in sleep, or a dog as it lies before the fire and dreams. Wewere starting forward, but the Professor’s warning hand, seen by us ashe stood behind a yew-tree, kept us back; and then as we looked thewhite figure moved forwards again. It was now near enough for us to seeclearly, and the moonlight still held. My own heart grew cold as ice,and I could hear the gasp of Arthur, as we recognised the features ofLucy Westenra. Lucy Westenra, but yet how changed. The sweetness wasturned to adamantine, heartless cruelty, and the purity to voluptuouswantonness. Van Helsing stepped out, and, obedient to his gesture, weall advanced too; the four of us ranged in a line before the door of thetomb. Van Helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide; by theconcentrated light that fell on Lucy’s face we could see that the lipswere crimson with fresh blood, and that the stream had trickled over herchin and stained the purity of her lawn death-robe.We shuddered with horror. I could see by the tremulous light that evenVan Helsing’s iron nerve had failed. Arthur was next to me, and if I hadnot seized his arm and held him up, he would have fallen.When Lucy--I call the thing that was before us Lucy because it bore hershape--saw us she drew back with an angry snarl, such as a cat giveswhen taken unawares; then her eyes ranged over us. Lucy’s eyes in formand colour; but Lucy’s eyes unclean and full of hell-fire, instead ofthe pure, gentle orbs we knew. At that moment the remnant of my lovepassed into hate and loathing; had she then to be killed, I could havedone it with savage delight. As she looked, her eyes blazed with unholylight, and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile. Oh, God,how it made me shudder to see it! With a careless motion, she flung tothe ground, callous as a devil, the child that up to now she hadclutched strenuously to her breast, growling over it as a dog growlsover a bone. The child gave a sharp cry, and lay there moaning. Therewas a cold-bloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from Arthur; whenshe advanced to him with outstretched arms and a wanton smile he fellback and hid his face in his hands.She still advanced, however, and with a languorous, voluptuous grace,said:--“Come to me, Arthur. Leave these others and come to me. My arms arehungry for you. Come, and we can rest together. Come, my husband, come!”There was something diabolically sweet in her tones--something of thetingling of glass when struck--which rang through the brains even of uswho heard the words addressed to another. As for Arthur, he seemed undera spell; moving his hands from his face, he opened wide his arms. Shewas leaping for them, when Van Helsing sprang forward and held betweenthem his little golden crucifix. She recoiled from it, and, with asuddenly distorted face, full of rage, dashed past him as if to enterthe tomb.When within a foot or two of the door, however, she stopped, as ifarrested by some irresistible force. Then she turned, and her face wasshown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp, which had now noquiver from Van Helsing’s iron nerves. Never did I see such baffledmalice on a face; and never, I trust, shall such ever be seen again bymortal eyes. The beautiful colour became livid, the eyes seemed to throwout sparks of hell-fire, the brows were wrinkled as though the folds ofthe flesh were the coils of Medusa’s snakes, and the lovely,blood-stained mouth grew to an open square, as in the passion masks ofthe Greeks and Japanese. If ever a face meant death--if looks couldkill--we saw it at that moment.And so for full half a minute, which seemed an eternity, she remainedbetween the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of her means ofentry. Van Helsing broke the silence by asking Arthur:--“Answer me, oh my friend! Am I to proceed in my work?”Arthur threw himself on his knees, and hid his face in his hands, as heanswered:--“Do as you will, friend; do as you will. There can be no horror likethis ever any more;” and he groaned in spirit. Quincey and Isimultaneously moved towards him, and took his arms. We could hear theclick of the closing lantern as Van Helsing held it down; coming closeto the tomb, he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacredemblem which he had placed there. We all looked on in horrifiedamazement as we saw, when he stood back, the woman, with a corporealbody as real at that moment as our own, pass in through the intersticewhere scarce a knife-blade could have gone. We all felt a glad sense ofrelief when we saw the Professor calmly restoring the strings of puttyto the edges of the door.When this was done, he lifted the child and said:“Come now, my friends; we can do no more till to-morrow. There is afuneral at noon, so here we shall all come before long after that. Thefriends of the dead will all be gone by two, and when the sexton lockthe gate we shall remain. Then there is more to do; but not like this ofto-night. As for this little one, he is not much harm, and by to-morrownight he shall be well. We shall leave him where the police will findhim, as on the other night; and then to home.” Coming close to Arthur,he said:--“My friend Arthur, you have had a sore trial; but after, when you lookback, you will see how it was necessary. You are now in the bitterwaters, my child. By this time to-morrow you will, please God, havepassed them, and have drunk of the sweet waters; so do not mournovermuch. Till then I shall not ask you to forgive me.”Arthur and Quincey came home with me, and we tried to cheer each otheron the way. We had left the child in safety, and were tired; so we allslept with more or less reality of sleep.*       *       *       *       *_29 September, night._--A little before twelve o’clock we three--Arthur,Quincey Morris, and myself--called for the Professor. It was odd tonotice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes. Ofcourse, Arthur wore black, for he was in deep mourning, but the rest ofus wore it by instinct. We got to the churchyard by half-past one, andstrolled about, keeping out of official observation, so that when thegravediggers had completed their task and the sexton under the beliefthat every one had gone, had locked the gate, we had the place all toourselves. Van Helsing, instead of his little black bag, had with him along leather one, something like a cricketing bag; it was manifestly offair weight.When we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out upthe road, we silently, and as if by ordered intention, followed theProfessor to the tomb. He unlocked the door, and we entered, closing itbehind us. Then he took from his bag the lantern, which he lit, and alsotwo wax candles, which, when lighted, he stuck, by melting their ownends, on other coffins, so that they might give light sufficient to workby. When he again lifted the lid off Lucy’s coffin we all looked--Arthurtrembling like an aspen--and saw that the body lay there in all itsdeath-beauty. But there was no love in my own heart, nothing butloathing for the foul Thing which had taken Lucy’s shape without hersoul. I could see even Arthur’s face grow hard as he looked. Presentlyhe said to Van Helsing:--“Is this really Lucy’s body, or only a demon in her shape?”“It is her body, and yet not it. But wait a while, and you all see heras she was, and is.”She seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there; the pointed teeth,the bloodstained, voluptuous mouth--which it made one shudder tosee--the whole carnal and unspiritual appearance, seeming like adevilish mockery of Lucy’s sweet purity. Van Helsing, with his usualmethodicalness, began taking the various contents from his bag andplacing them ready for use. First he took out a soldering iron and someplumbing solder, and then a small oil-lamp, which gave out, when lit ina corner of the tomb, gas which burned at fierce heat with a blueflame; then his operating knives, which he placed to hand; and last around wooden stake, some two and a half or three inches thick and aboutthree feet long. One end of it was hardened by charring in the fire, andwas sharpened to a fine point. With this stake came a heavy hammer, suchas in households is used in the coal-cellar for breaking the lumps. Tome, a doctor’s preparations for work of any kind are stimulating andbracing, but the effect of these things on both Arthur and Quincey wasto cause them a sort of consternation. They both, however, kept theircourage, and remained silent and quiet.When all was ready, Van Helsing said:--“Before we do anything, let me tell you this; it is out of the lore andexperience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powersof the Un-Dead. When they become such, there comes with the change thecurse of immortality; they cannot die, but must go on age after ageadding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world; for all thatdie from the preying of the Un-Dead becomes themselves Un-Dead, and preyon their kind. And so the circle goes on ever widening, like as theripples from a stone thrown in the water. Friend Arthur, if you had metthat kiss which you know of before poor Lucy die; or again, last nightwhen you open your arms to her, you would in time, when you had died,have become _nosferatu_, as they call it in Eastern Europe, and wouldall time make more of those Un-Deads that so have fill us with horror.The career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun. Thosechildren whose blood she suck are not as yet so much the worse; but ifshe live on, Un-Dead, more and more they lose their blood and by herpower over them they come to her; and so she draw their blood with thatso wicked mouth. But if she die in truth, then all cease; the tinywounds of the throats disappear, and they go back to their playsunknowing ever of what has been. But of the most blessed of all, whenthis now Un-Dead be made to rest as true dead, then the soul of the poorlady whom we love shall again be free. Instead of working wickedness bynight and growing more debased in the assimilating of it by day, sheshall take her place with the other Angels. So that, my friend, it willbe a blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free.To this I am willing; but is there none amongst us who has a betterright? Will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of thenight when sleep is not: ‘It was my hand that sent her to the stars; itwas the hand of him that loved her best; the hand that of all she wouldherself have chosen, had it been to her to choose?’ Tell me if there besuch a one amongst us?”We all looked at Arthur. He saw, too, what we all did, the infinitekindness which suggested that his should be the hand which would restoreLucy to us as a holy, and not an unholy, memory; he stepped forward andsaid bravely, though his hand trembled, and his face was as pale assnow:--“My true friend, from the bottom of my broken heart I thank you. Tell mewhat I am to do, and I shall not falter!” Van Helsing laid a hand on hisshoulder, and said:--“Brave lad! A moment’s courage, and it is done. This stake must bedriven through her. It will be a fearful ordeal--be not deceived inthat--but it will be only a short time, and you will then rejoice morethan your pain was great; from this grim tomb you will emerge as thoughyou tread on air. But you must not falter when once you have begun. Onlythink that we, your true friends, are round you, and that we pray foryou all the time.”“Go on,” said Arthur hoarsely. “Tell me what I am to do.”“Take this stake in your left hand, ready to place the point over theheart, and the hammer in your right. Then when we begin our prayer forthe dead--I shall read him, I have here the book, and the others shallfollow--strike in God’s name, that so all may be well with the dead thatwe love and that the Un-Dead pass away.”Arthur took the stake and the hammer, and when once his mind was set onaction his hands never trembled nor even quivered. Van Helsing openedhis missal and began to read, and Quincey and I followed as well as wecould. Arthur placed the point over the heart, and as I looked I couldsee its dint in the white flesh. Then he struck with all his might.The Thing in the coffin writhed; and a hideous, blood-curdling screechcame from the opened red lips. The body shook and quivered and twistedin wild contortions; the sharp white teeth champed together till thelips were cut, and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam. But Arthurnever faltered. He looked like a figure of Thor as his untrembling armrose and fell, driving deeper and deeper the mercy-bearing stake, whilstthe blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it. Hisface was set, and high duty seemed to shine through it; the sight of itgave us courage so that our voices seemed to ring through the littlevault.And then the writhing and quivering of the body became less, and theteeth seemed to champ, and the face to quiver. Finally it lay still. Theterrible task was over.The hammer fell from Arthur’s hand. He reeled and would have fallen hadwe not caught him. The great drops of sweat sprang from his forehead,and his breath came in broken gasps. It had indeed been an awful strainon him; and had he not been forced to his task by more than humanconsiderations he could never have gone through with it. For a fewminutes we were so taken up with him that we did not look towards thecoffin. When we did, however, a murmur of startled surprise ran from oneto the other of us. We gazed so eagerly that Arthur rose, for he hadbeen seated on the ground, and came and looked too; and then a glad,strange light broke over his face and dispelled altogether the gloom ofhorror that lay upon it.There, in the coffin lay no longer the foul Thing that we had so dreadedand grown to hate that the work of her destruction was yielded as aprivilege to the one best entitled to it, but Lucy as we had seen her inher life, with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity. True thatthere were there, as we had seen them in life, the traces of care andpain and waste; but these were all dear to us, for they marked her truthto what we knew. One and all we felt that the holy calm that lay likesunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token andsymbol of the calm that was to reign for ever.Van Helsing came and laid his hand on Arthur’s shoulder, and said tohim:--“And now, Arthur my friend, dear lad, am I not forgiven?”The reaction of the terrible strain came as he took the old man’s handin his, and raising it to his lips, pressed it, and said:--“Forgiven! God bless you that you have given my dear one her soul again,and me peace.” He put his hands on the Professor’s shoulder, and layinghis head on his breast, cried for a while silently, whilst we stoodunmoving. When he raised his head Van Helsing said to him:--“And now, my child, you may kiss her. Kiss her dead lips if you will, asshe would have you to, if for her to choose. For she is not a grinningdevil now--not any more a foul Thing for all eternity. No longer she isthe devil’s Un-Dead. She is God’s true dead, whose soul is with Him!”Arthur bent and kissed her, and then we sent him and Quincey out of thetomb; the Professor and I sawed the top off the stake, leaving the pointof it in the body. Then we cut off the head and filled the mouth withgarlic. We soldered up the leaden coffin, screwed on the coffin-lid,and gathering up our belongings, came away. When the Professor lockedthe door he gave the key to Arthur.Outside the air was sweet, the sun shone, and the birds sang, and itseemed as if all nature were tuned to a different pitch. There wasgladness and mirth and peace everywhere, for we were at rest ourselveson one account, and we were glad, though it was with a tempered joy.Before we moved away Van Helsing said:--“Now, my friends, one step of our work is done, one the most harrowingto ourselves. But there remains a greater task: to find out the authorof all this our sorrow and to stamp him out. I have clues which we canfollow; but it is a long task, and a difficult, and there is danger init, and pain. Shall you not all help me? We have learned to believe, allof us--is it not so? And since so, do we not see our duty? Yes! And dowe not promise to go on to the bitter end?”Each in turn, we took his hand, and the promise was made. Then said theProfessor as we moved off:--“Two nights hence you shall meet with me and dine together at seven ofthe clock with friend John. I shall entreat two others, two that youknow not as yet; and I shall be ready to all our work show and our plansunfold. Friend John, you come with me home, for I have much to consultabout, and you can help me. To-night I leave for Amsterdam, but shallreturn to-morrow night. And then begins our great quest. But first Ishall have much to say, so that you may know what is to do and to dread.Then our promise shall be made to each other anew; for there is aterrible task before us, and once our feet are on the ploughshare wemust not draw back.”CHAPTER XVIIDR. SEWARD’S DIARY--_continued_When we arrived at the Berkeley Hotel, Van Helsing found a telegramwaiting for him:--“Am coming up by train. Jonathan at Whitby. Important news.--MINAHARKER.”The Professor was delighted. “Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina,” he said,“pearl among women! She arrive, but I cannot stay. She must go to yourhouse, friend John. You must meet her at the station. Telegraph her _enroute_, so that she may be prepared.”When the wire was despatched he had a cup of tea; over it he told me ofa diary kept by Jonathan Harker when abroad, and gave me a typewrittencopy of it, as also of Mrs. Harker’s diary at Whitby. “Take these,” hesaid, “and study them well. When I have returned you will be master ofall the facts, and we can then better enter on our inquisition. Keepthem safe, for there is in them much of treasure. You will need all yourfaith, even you who have had such an experience as that of to-day. Whatis here told,” he laid his hand heavily and gravely on the packet ofpapers as he spoke, “may be the beginning of the end to you and me andmany another; or it may sound the knell of the Un-Dead who walk theearth. Read all, I pray you, with the open mind; and if you can add inany way to the story here told do so, for it is all-important. You havekept diary of all these so strange things; is it not so? Yes! Then weshall go through all these together when we meet.” He then made readyfor his departure, and shortly after drove off to Liverpool Street. Itook my way to Paddington, where I arrived about fifteen minutes beforethe train came in.The crowd melted away, after the bustling fashion common to arrivalplatforms; and I was beginning to feel uneasy, lest I might miss myguest, when a sweet-faced, dainty-looking girl stepped up to me, and,after a quick glance, said: “Dr. Seward, is it not?”“And you are Mrs. Harker!” I answered at once; whereupon she held outher hand.“I knew you from the description of poor dear Lucy; but----” She stoppedsuddenly, and a quick blush overspread her face.The blush that rose to my own cheeks somehow set us both at ease, for itwas a tacit answer to her own. I got her luggage, which included atypewriter, and we took the Underground to Fenchurch Street, after I hadsent a wire to my housekeeper to have a sitting-room and bedroomprepared at once for Mrs. Harker.In due time we arrived. She knew, of course, that the place was alunatic asylum, but I could see that she was unable to repress a shudderwhen we entered.She told me that, if she might, she would come presently to my study, asshe had much to say. So here I am finishing my entry in my phonographdiary whilst I await her. As yet I have not had the chance of looking atthe papers which Van Helsing left with me, though they lie open beforeme. I must get her interested in something, so that I may have anopportunity of reading them. She does not know how precious time is, orwhat a task we have in hand. I must be careful not to frighten her. Hereshe is!_Mina Harker’s Journal.__29 September._--After I had tidied myself, I went down to Dr. Seward’sstudy. At the door I paused a moment, for I thought I heard him talkingwith some one. As, however, he had pressed me to be quick, I knocked atthe door, and on his calling out, “Come in,” I entered.To my intense surprise, there was no one with him. He was quite alone,and on the table opposite him was what I knew at once from thedescription to be a phonograph. I had never seen one, and was muchinterested.“I hope I did not keep you waiting,” I said; “but I stayed at the dooras I heard you talking, and thought there was some one with you.”“Oh,” he replied with a smile, “I was only entering my diary.”“Your diary?” I asked him in surprise.“Yes,” he answered. “I keep it in this.” As he spoke he laid his hand onthe phonograph. I felt quite excited over it, and blurted out:--“Why, this beats even shorthand! May I hear it say something?”“Certainly,” he replied with alacrity, and stood up to put it in trainfor speaking. Then he paused, and a troubled look overspread his face.“The fact is,” he began awkwardly, “I only keep my diary in it; and asit is entirely--almost entirely--about my cases, it may be awkward--thatis, I mean----” He stopped, and I tried to help him out of hisembarrassment:--“You helped to attend dear Lucy at the end. Let me hear how she died;for all that I know of her, I shall be very grateful. She was very, verydear to me.”To my surprise, he answered, with a horrorstruck look in his face:--“Tell you of her death? Not for the wide world!”“Why not?” I asked, for some grave, terrible feeling was coming over me.Again he paused, and I could see that he was trying to invent an excuse.At length he stammered out:--“You see, I do not know how to pick out any particular part of thediary.” Even while he was speaking an idea dawned upon him, and he saidwith unconscious simplicity, in a different voice, and with the naïvetéof a child: “That’s quite true, upon my honour. Honest Indian!” I couldnot but smile, at which he grimaced. “I gave myself away that time!” hesaid. “But do you know that, although I have kept the diary for monthspast, it never once struck me how I was going to find any particularpart of it in case I wanted to look it up?” By this time my mind wasmade up that the diary of a doctor who attended Lucy might havesomething to add to the sum of our knowledge of that terrible Being, andI said boldly:--“Then, Dr. Seward, you had better let me copy it out for you on mytypewriter.” He grew to a positively deathly pallor as he said:--“No! no! no! For all the world, I wouldn’t let you know that terriblestory!”Then it was terrible; my intuition was right! For a moment I thought,and as my eyes ranged the room, unconsciously looking for something orsome opportunity to aid me, they lit on a great batch of typewriting onthe table. His eyes caught the look in mine, and, without his thinking,followed their direction. As they saw the parcel he realised my meaning.“You do not know me,” I said. “When you have read those papers--my owndiary and my husband’s also, which I have typed--you will know mebetter. I have not faltered in giving every thought of my own heart inthis cause; but, of course, you do not know me--yet; and I must notexpect you to trust me so far.”He is certainly a man of noble nature; poor dear Lucy was right abouthim. He stood up and opened a large drawer, in which were arranged inorder a number of hollow cylinders of metal covered with dark wax, andsaid:--“You are quite right. I did not trust you because I did not know you.But I know you now; and let me say that I should have known you longago. I know that Lucy told you of me; she told me of you too. May I makethe only atonement in my power? Take the cylinders and hear them--thefirst half-dozen of them are personal to me, and they will not horrifyyou; then you will know me better. Dinner will by then be ready. In themeantime I shall read over some of these documents, and shall be betterable to understand certain things.” He carried the phonograph himself upto my sitting-room and adjusted it for me. Now I shall learn somethingpleasant, I am sure; for it will tell me the other side of a true loveepisode of which I know one side already...._Dr. Seward’s Diary.__29 September._--I was so absorbed in that wonderful diary of JonathanHarker and that other of his wife that I let the time run on withoutthinking. Mrs. Harker was not down when the maid came to announcedinner, so I said: “She is possibly tired; let dinner wait an hour,” andI went on with my work. I had just finished Mrs. Harker’s diary, whenshe came in. She looked sweetly pretty, but very sad, and her eyes wereflushed with crying. This somehow moved me much. Of late I have hadcause for tears, God knows! but the relief of them was denied me; andnow the sight of those sweet eyes, brightened with recent tears, wentstraight to my heart. So I said as gently as I could:--“I greatly fear I have distressed you.”“Oh, no, not distressed me,” she replied, “but I have been more touchedthan I can say by your grief. That is a wonderful machine, but it iscruelly true. It told me, in its very tones, the anguish of your heart.It was like a soul crying out to Almighty God. No one must hear themspoken ever again! See, I have tried to be useful. I have copied out thewords on my typewriter, and none other need now hear your heart beat, asI did.”“No one need ever know, shall ever know,” I said in a low voice. Shelaid her hand on mine and said very gravely:--“Ah, but they must!”“Must! But why?” I asked.“Because it is a part of the terrible story, a part of poor dear Lucy’sdeath and all that led to it; because in the struggle which we havebefore us to rid the earth of this terrible monster we must have allthe knowledge and all the help which we can get. I think that thecylinders which you gave me contained more than you intended me to know;but I can see that there are in your record many lights to this darkmystery. You will let me help, will you not? I know all up to a certainpoint; and I see already, though your diary only took me to 7 September,how poor Lucy was beset, and how her terrible doom was being wroughtout. Jonathan and I have been working day and night since Professor VanHelsing saw us. He is gone to Whitby to get more information, and hewill be here to-morrow to help us. We need have no secrets amongst us;working together and with absolute trust, we can surely be stronger thanif some of us were in the dark.” She looked at me so appealingly, and atthe same time manifested such courage and resolution in her bearing,that I gave in at once to her wishes. “You shall,” I said, “do as youlike in the matter. God forgive me if I do wrong! There are terriblethings yet to learn of; but if you have so far travelled on the road topoor Lucy’s death, you will not be content, I know, to remain in thedark. Nay, the end--the very end--may give you a gleam of peace. Come,there is dinner. We must keep one another strong for what is before us;we have a cruel and dreadful task. When you have eaten you shall learnthe rest, and I shall answer any questions you ask--if there be anythingwhich you do not understand, though it was apparent to us who werepresent.”_Mina Harker’s Journal.__29 September._--After dinner I came with Dr. Seward to his study. Hebrought back the phonograph from my room, and I took my typewriter. Heplaced me in a comfortable chair, and arranged the phonograph so that Icould touch it without getting up, and showed me how to stop it in caseI should want to pause. Then he very thoughtfully took a chair, with hisback to me, so that I might be as free as possible, and began to read. Iput the forked metal to my ears and listened.When the terrible story of Lucy’s death, and--and all that followed, wasdone, I lay back in my chair powerless. Fortunately I am not of afainting disposition. When Dr. Seward saw me he jumped up with ahorrified exclamation, and hurriedly taking a case-bottle from acupboard, gave me some brandy, which in a few minutes somewhat restoredme. My brain was all in a whirl, and only that there came through allthe multitude of horrors, the holy ray of light that my dear, dear Lucywas at last at peace, I do not think I could have borne it withoutmaking a scene. It is all so wild, and mysterious, and strange that if Ihad not known Jonathan’s experience in Transylvania I could not havebelieved. As it was, I didn’t know what to believe, and so got out of mydifficulty by attending to something else. I took the cover off mytypewriter, and said to Dr. Seward:--“Let me write this all out now. We must be ready for Dr. Van Helsingwhen he comes. I have sent a telegram to Jonathan to come on here whenhe arrives in London from Whitby. In this matter dates are everything,and I think that if we get all our material ready, and have every itemput in chronological order, we shall have done much. You tell me thatLord Godalming and Mr. Morris are coming too. Let us be able to tell himwhen they come.” He accordingly set the phonograph at a slow pace, and Ibegan to typewrite from the beginning of the seventh cylinder. I usedmanifold, and so took three copies of the diary, just as I had done withall the rest. It was late when I got through, but Dr. Seward went abouthis work of going his round of the patients; when he had finished hecame back and sat near me, reading, so that I did not feel too lonelywhilst I worked. How good and thoughtful he is; the world seems full ofgood men--even if there _are_ monsters in it. Before I left him Iremembered what Jonathan put in his diary of the Professor’sperturbation at reading something in an evening paper at the station atExeter; so, seeing that Dr. Seward keeps his newspapers, I borrowed thefiles of “The Westminster Gazette” and “The Pall Mall Gazette,” and tookthem to my room. I remember how much “The Dailygraph” and “The WhitbyGazette,” of which I had made cuttings, helped us to understand theterrible events at Whitby when Count Dracula landed, so I shall lookthrough the evening papers since then, and perhaps I shall get some newlight. I am not sleepy, and the work will help to keep me quiet._Dr. Seward’s Diary.__30 September._--Mr. Harker arrived at nine o’clock. He had got hiswife’s wire just before starting. He is uncommonly clever, if one canjudge from his face, and full of energy. If this journal be true--andjudging by one’s own wonderful experiences, it must be--he is also a manof great nerve. That going down to the vault a second time was aremarkable piece of daring. After reading his account of it I wasprepared to meet a good specimen of manhood, but hardly the quiet,business-like gentleman who came here to-day.*       *       *       *       *_Later._--After lunch Harker and his wife went back to their own room,and as I passed a while ago I heard the click of the typewriter. Theyare hard at it. Mrs. Harker says that they are knitting together inchronological order every scrap of evidence they have. Harker has gotthe letters between the consignee of the boxes at Whitby and thecarriers in London who took charge of them. He is now reading his wife’stypescript of my diary. I wonder what they make out of it. Here itis....Strange that it never struck me that the very next house might bethe Count’s hiding-place! Goodness knows that we had enough cluesfrom the conduct of the patient Renfield! The bundle of lettersrelating to the purchase of the house were with the typescript. Oh,if we had only had them earlier we might have saved poor Lucy!Stop; that way madness lies! Harker has gone back, and is againcollating his material. He says that by dinner-time they will beable to show a whole connected narrative. He thinks that in themeantime I should see Renfield, as hitherto he has been a sort ofindex to the coming and going of the Count. I hardly see this yet,but when I get at the dates I suppose I shall. What a good thingthat Mrs. Harker put my cylinders into type! We never could havefound the dates otherwise....I found Renfield sitting placidly in his room with his handsfolded, smiling benignly. At the moment he seemed as sane as anyone I ever saw. I sat down and talked with him on a lot ofsubjects, all of which he treated naturally. He then, of his ownaccord, spoke of going home, a subject he has never mentioned to myknowledge during his sojourn here. In fact, he spoke quiteconfidently of getting his discharge at once. I believe that, had Inot had the chat with Harker and read the letters and the dates ofhis outbursts, I should have been prepared to sign for him after abrief time of observation. As it is, I am darkly suspicious. Allthose outbreaks were in some way linked with the proximity of theCount. What then does this absolute content mean? Can it be thathis instinct is satisfied as to the vampire’s ultimate triumph?Stay; he is himself zoöphagous, and in his wild ravings outside thechapel door of the deserted house he always spoke of “master.” Thisall seems confirmation of our idea. However, after a while I cameaway; my friend is just a little too sane at present to make itsafe to probe him too deep with questions. He might begin to think,and then--! So I came away. I mistrust these quiet moods of his; soI have given the attendant a hint to look closely after him, and tohave a strait-waistcoat ready in case of need._Jonathan Harker’s Journal.__29 September, in train to London._--When I received Mr. Billington’scourteous message that he would give me any information in his power Ithought it best to go down to Whitby and make, on the spot, suchinquiries as I wanted. It was now my object to trace that horrid cargoof the Count’s to its place in London. Later, we may be able to dealwith it. Billington junior, a nice lad, met me at the station, andbrought me to his father’s house, where they had decided that I muststay the night. They are hospitable, with true Yorkshire hospitality:give a guest everything, and leave him free to do as he likes. They allknew that I was busy, and that my stay was short, and Mr. Billington hadready in his office all the papers concerning the consignment of boxes.It gave me almost a turn to see again one of the letters which I hadseen on the Count’s table before I knew of his diabolical plans.Everything had been carefully thought out, and done systematically andwith precision. He seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle whichmight be placed by accident in the way of his intentions being carriedout. To use an Americanism, he had “taken no chances,” and the absoluteaccuracy with which his instructions were fulfilled, was simply thelogical result of his care. I saw the invoice, and took note of it:“Fifty cases of common earth, to be used for experimental purposes.”Also the copy of letter to Carter Paterson, and their reply; of both ofthese I got copies. This was all the information Mr. Billington couldgive me, so I went down to the port and saw the coastguards, the Customsofficers and the harbour-master. They had all something to say of thestrange entry of the ship, which is already taking its place in localtradition; but no one could add to the simple description “Fifty casesof common earth.” I then saw the station-master, who kindly put me incommunication with the men who had actually received the boxes. Theirtally was exact with the list, and they had nothing to add except thatthe boxes were “main and mortal heavy,” and that shifting them was drywork. One of them added that it was hard lines that there wasn’t anygentleman “such-like as yourself, squire,” to show some sort ofappreciation of their efforts in a liquid form; another put in a riderthat the thirst then generated was such that even the time which hadelapsed had not completely allayed it. Needless to add, I took carebefore leaving to lift, for ever and adequately, this source ofreproach.*       *       *       *       *_30 September._--The station-master was good enough to give me a line tohis old companion the station-master at King’s Cross, so that when Iarrived there in the morning I was able to ask him about the arrival ofthe boxes. He, too, put me at once in communication with the properofficials, and I saw that their tally was correct with the originalinvoice. The opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had been herelimited; a noble use of them had, however, been made, and again I wascompelled to deal with the result in an _ex post facto_ manner.From thence I went on to Carter Paterson’s central office, where I metwith the utmost courtesy. They looked up the transaction in theirday-book and letter-book, and at once telephoned to their King’s Crossoffice for more details. By good fortune, the men who did the teamingwere waiting for work, and the official at once sent them over, sendingalso by one of them the way-bill and all the papers connected with thedelivery of the boxes at Carfax. Here again I found the tally agreeingexactly; the carriers’ men were able to supplement the paucity of thewritten words with a few details. These were, I shortly found, connectedalmost solely with the dusty nature of the job, and of the consequentthirst engendered in the operators. On my affording an opportunity,through the medium of the currency of the realm, of the allaying, at alater period, this beneficial evil, one of the men remarked:--“That ’ere ’ouse, guv’nor, is the rummiest I ever was in. Blyme! but itain’t been touched sence a hundred years. There was dust that thick inthe place that you might have slep’ on it without ’urtin’ of yer bones;an’ the place was that neglected that yer might ’ave smelled oleJerusalem in it. But the ole chapel--that took the cike, that did! Meand my mate, we thort we wouldn’t never git out quick enough. Lor’, Iwouldn’t take less nor a quid a moment to stay there arter dark.”Having been in the house, I could well believe him; but if he knew whatI know, he would, I think, have raised his terms.Of one thing I am now satisfied: that _all_ the boxes which arrived atWhitby from Varna in the _Demeter_ were safely deposited in the oldchapel at Carfax. There should be fifty of them there, unless any havesince been removed--as from Dr. Seward’s diary I fear.I shall try to see the carter who took away the boxes from Carfax whenRenfield attacked them. By following up this clue we may learn a gooddeal.*       *       *       *       *_Later._--Mina and I have worked all day, and we have put all the papersinto order._Mina Harker’s Journal__30 September._--I am so glad that I hardly know how to contain myself.It is, I suppose, the reaction from the haunting fear which I have had:that this terrible affair and the reopening of his old wound might actdetrimentally on Jonathan. I saw him leave for Whitby with as brave aface as I could, but I was sick with apprehension. The effort has,however, done him good. He was never so resolute, never so strong, neverso full of volcanic energy, as at present. It is just as that dear, goodProfessor Van Helsing said: he is true grit, and he improves understrain that would kill a weaker nature. He came back full of life andhope and determination; we have got everything in order for to-night. Ifeel myself quite wild with excitement. I suppose one ought to pity anything so hunted as is the Count. That is just it: this Thing is nothuman--not even beast. To read Dr. Seward’s account of poor Lucy’sdeath, and what followed, is enough to dry up the springs of pity inone’s heart.*       *       *       *       *_Later._--Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris arrived earlier than weexpected. Dr. Seward was out on business, and had taken Jonathan withhim, so I had to see them. It was to me a painful meeting, for itbrought back all poor dear Lucy’s hopes of only a few months ago. Ofcourse they had heard Lucy speak of me, and it seemed that Dr. VanHelsing, too, has been quite “blowing my trumpet,” as Mr. Morrisexpressed it. Poor fellows, neither of them is aware that I know allabout the proposals they made to Lucy. They did not quite know what tosay or do, as they were ignorant of the amount of my knowledge; so theyhad to keep on neutral subjects. However, I thought the matter over, andcame to the conclusion that the best thing I could do would be to postthem in affairs right up to date. I knew from Dr. Seward’s diary thatthey had been at Lucy’s death--her real death--and that I need not fearto betray any secret before the time. So I told them, as well as Icould, that I had read all the papers and diaries, and that my husbandand I, having typewritten them, had just finished putting them in order.I gave them each a copy to read in the library. When Lord Godalming gothis and turned it over--it does make a pretty good pile--he said:--“Did you write all this, Mrs. Harker?”I nodded, and he went on:--“I don’t quite see the drift of it; but you people are all so good andkind, and have been working so earnestly and so energetically, that allI can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you. I havehad one lesson already in accepting facts that should make a man humbleto the last hour of his life. Besides, I know you loved my poor Lucy--”Here he turned away and covered his face with his hands. I could hearthe tears in his voice. Mr. Morris, with instinctive delicacy, just laida hand for a moment on his shoulder, and then walked quietly out of theroom. I suppose there is something in woman’s nature that makes a manfree to break down before her and express his feelings on the tender oremotional side without feeling it derogatory to his manhood; for whenLord Godalming found himself alone with me he sat down on the sofa andgave way utterly and openly. I sat down beside him and took his hand. Ihope he didn’t think it forward of me, and that if he ever thinks of itafterwards he never will have such a thought. There I wrong him; I_know_ he never will--he is too true a gentleman. I said to him, for Icould see that his heart was breaking:--“I loved dear Lucy, and I know what she was to you, and what you were toher. She and I were like sisters; and now she is gone, will you not letme be like a sister to you in your trouble? I know what sorrows you havehad, though I cannot measure the depth of them. If sympathy and pity canhelp in your affliction, won’t you let me be of some little service--forLucy’s sake?”In an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief. It seemedto me that all that he had of late been suffering in silence found avent at once. He grew quite hysterical, and raising his open hands, beathis palms together in a perfect agony of grief. He stood up and then satdown again, and the tears rained down his cheeks. I felt an infinitepity for him, and opened my arms unthinkingly. With a sob he laid hishead on my shoulder and cried like a wearied child, whilst he shook withemotion.We women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise abovesmaller matters when the mother-spirit is invoked; I felt this bigsorrowing man’s head resting on me, as though it were that of the babythat some day may lie on my bosom, and I stroked his hair as though hewere my own child. I never thought at the time how strange it all was.After a little bit his sobs ceased, and he raised himself with anapology, though he made no disguise of his emotion. He told me that fordays and nights past--weary days and sleepless nights--he had beenunable to speak with any one, as a man must speak in his time ofsorrow. There was no woman whose sympathy could be given to him, or withwhom, owing to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow wassurrounded, he could speak freely. “I know now how I suffered,” he said,as he dried his eyes, “but I do not know even yet--and none other canever know--how much your sweet sympathy has been to me to-day. I shallknow better in time; and believe me that, though I am not ungratefulnow, my gratitude will grow with my understanding. You will let me belike a brother, will you not, for all our lives--for dear Lucy’s sake?”“For dear Lucy’s sake,” I said as we clasped hands. “Ay, and for yourown sake,” he added, “for if a man’s esteem and gratitude are ever worththe winning, you have won mine to-day. If ever the future should bringto you a time when you need a man’s help, believe me, you will not callin vain. God grant that no such time may ever come to you to break thesunshine of your life; but if it should ever come, promise me that youwill let me know.” He was so earnest, and his sorrow was so fresh, thatI felt it would comfort him, so I said:--“I promise.”As I came along the corridor I saw Mr. Morris looking out of a window.He turned as he heard my footsteps. “How is Art?” he said. Then noticingmy red eyes, he went on: “Ah, I see you have been comforting him. Poorold fellow! he needs it. No one but a woman can help a man when he is introuble of the heart; and he had no one to comfort him.”He bore his own trouble so bravely that my heart bled for him. I saw themanuscript in his hand, and I knew that when he read it he would realisehow much I knew; so I said to him:--“I wish I could comfort all who suffer from the heart. Will you let mebe your friend, and will you come to me for comfort if you need it? Youwill know, later on, why I speak.” He saw that I was in earnest, andstooping, took my hand, and raising it to his lips, kissed it. It seemedbut poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul, and impulsively Ibent over and kissed him. The tears rose in his eyes, and there was amomentary choking in his throat; he said quite calmly:--“Little girl, you will never regret that true-hearted kindness, so longas ever you live!” Then he went into the study to his friend.“Little girl!”--the very words he had used to Lucy, and oh, but heproved himself a friend!CHAPTER XVIIIDR. SEWARD’S DIARY_30 September._--I got home at five o’clock, and found that Godalmingand Morris had not only arrived, but had already studied the transcriptof the various diaries and letters which Harker and his wonderful wifehad made and arranged. Harker had not yet returned from his visit to thecarriers’ men, of whom Dr. Hennessey had written to me. Mrs. Harker gaveus a cup of tea, and I can honestly say that, for the first time since Ihave lived in it, this old house seemed like _home_. When we hadfinished, Mrs. Harker said:--“Dr. Seward, may I ask a favour? I want to see your patient, Mr.Renfield. Do let me see him. What you have said of him in your diaryinterests me so much!” She looked so appealing and so pretty that Icould not refuse her, and there was no possible reason why I should; soI took her with me. When I went into the room, I told the man that alady would like to see him; to which he simply answered: “Why?”“She is going through the house, and wants to see every one in it,” Ianswered. “Oh, very well,” he said; “let her come in, by all means; butjust wait a minute till I tidy up the place.” His method of tidying waspeculiar: he simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxesbefore I could stop him. It was quite evident that he feared, or wasjealous of, some interference. When he had got through his disgustingtask, he said cheerfully: “Let the lady come in,” and sat down on theedge of his bed with his head down, but with his eyelids raised so thathe could see her as she entered. For a moment I thought that he mighthave some homicidal intent; I remembered how quiet he had been justbefore he attacked me in my own study, and I took care to stand where Icould seize him at once if he attempted to make a spring at her. Shecame into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once commandthe respect of any lunatic--for easiness is one of the qualities madpeople most respect. She walked over to him, smiling pleasantly, andheld out her hand.“Good-evening, Mr. Renfield,” said she. “You see, I know you, for Dr.Seward has told me of you.” He made no immediate reply, but eyed her allover intently with a set frown on his face. This look gave way to oneof wonder, which merged in doubt; then, to my intense astonishment, hesaid:--“You’re not the girl the doctor wanted to marry, are you? You can’t be,you know, for she’s dead.” Mrs. Harker smiled sweetly as she replied:--“Oh no! I have a husband of my own, to whom I was married before I eversaw Dr. Seward, or he me. I am Mrs. Harker.”“Then what are you doing here?”“My husband and I are staying on a visit with Dr. Seward.”“Then don’t stay.”“But why not?” I thought that this style of conversation might not bepleasant to Mrs. Harker, any more than it was to me, so I joined in:--“How did you know I wanted to marry any one?” His reply was simplycontemptuous, given in a pause in which he turned his eyes from Mrs.Harker to me, instantly turning them back again:--“What an asinine question!”“I don’t see that at all, Mr. Renfield,” said Mrs. Harker, at oncechampioning me. He replied to her with as much courtesy and respect ashe had shown contempt to me:--“You will, of course, understand, Mrs. Harker, that when a man is soloved and honoured as our host is, everything regarding him is ofinterest in our little community. Dr. Seward is loved not only by hishousehold and his friends, but even by his patients, who, being some ofthem hardly in mental equilibrium, are apt to distort causes andeffects. Since I myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum, Icannot but notice that the sophistic tendencies of some of its inmateslean towards the errors of _non causa_ and _ignoratio elenchi_.” Ipositively opened my eyes at this new development. Here was my own petlunatic--the most pronounced of his type that I had ever metwith--talking elemental philosophy, and with the manner of a polishedgentleman. I wonder if it was Mrs. Harker’s presence which had touchedsome chord in his memory. If this new phase was spontaneous, or in anyway due to her unconscious influence, she must have some rare gift orpower.We continued to talk for some time; and, seeing that he was seeminglyquite reasonable, she ventured, looking at me questioningly as shebegan, to lead him to his favourite topic. I was again astonished, forhe addressed himself to the question with the impartiality of thecompletest sanity; he even took himself as an example when he mentionedcertain things.“Why, I myself am an instance of a man who had a strange belief. Indeed,it was no wonder that my friends were alarmed, and insisted on my beingput under control. I used to fancy that life was a positive andperpetual entity, and that by consuming a multitude of live things, nomatter how low in the scale of creation, one might indefinitely prolonglife. At times I held the belief so strongly that I actually tried totake human life. The doctor here will bear me out that on one occasion Itried to kill him for the purpose of strengthening my vital powers bythe assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of hisblood--relying, of course, upon the Scriptural phrase, ‘For the blood isthe life.’ Though, indeed, the vendor of a certain nostrum hasvulgarised the truism to the very point of contempt. Isn’t that true,doctor?” I nodded assent, for I was so amazed that I hardly knew what toeither think or say; it was hard to imagine that I had seen him eat uphis spiders and flies not five minutes before. Looking at my watch, Isaw that I should go to the station to meet Van Helsing, so I told Mrs.Harker that it was time to leave. She came at once, after sayingpleasantly to Mr. Renfield: “Good-bye, and I hope I may see you often,under auspices pleasanter to yourself,” to which, to my astonishment, hereplied:--“Good-bye, my dear. I pray God I may never see your sweet face again.May He bless and keep you!”When I went to the station to meet Van Helsing I left the boys behindme. Poor Art seemed more cheerful than he has been since Lucy first tookill, and Quincey is more like his own bright self than he has been formany a long day.Van Helsing stepped from the carriage with the eager nimbleness of aboy. He saw me at once, and rushed up to me, saying:--“Ah, friend John, how goes all? Well? So! I have been busy, for I comehere to stay if need be. All affairs are settled with me, and I havemuch to tell. Madam Mina is with you? Yes. And her so fine husband? AndArthur and my friend Quincey, they are with you, too? Good!”As I drove to the house I told him of what had passed, and of how my owndiary had come to be of some use through Mrs. Harker’s suggestion; atwhich the Professor interrupted me:--“Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina! She has man’s brain--a brain that a manshould have were he much gifted--and a woman’s heart. The good Godfashioned her for a purpose, believe me, when He made that so goodcombination. Friend John, up to now fortune has made that woman of helpto us; after to-night she must not have to do with this so terribleaffair. It is not good that she run a risk so great. We men aredetermined--nay, are we not pledged?--to destroy this monster; but it isno part for a woman. Even if she be not harmed, her heart may fail herin so much and so many horrors; and hereafter she may suffer--both inwaking, from her nerves, and in sleep, from her dreams. And, besides,she is young woman and not so long married; there may be other things tothink of some time, if not now. You tell me she has wrote all, then shemust consult with us; but to-morrow she say good-bye to this work, andwe go alone.” I agreed heartily with him, and then I told him what wehad found in his absence: that the house which Dracula had bought wasthe very next one to my own. He was amazed, and a great concern seemedto come on him. “Oh that we had known it before!” he said, “for then wemight have reached him in time to save poor Lucy. However, ‘the milkthat is spilt cries not out afterwards,’ as you say. We shall not thinkof that, but go on our way to the end.” Then he fell into a silence thatlasted till we entered my own gateway. Before we went to prepare fordinner he said to Mrs. Harker:--“I am told, Madam Mina, by my friend John that you and your husband haveput up in exact order all things that have been, up to this moment.”“Not up to this moment, Professor,” she said impulsively, “but up tothis morning.”“But why not up to now? We have seen hitherto how good light all thelittle things have made. We have told our secrets, and yet no one whohas told is the worse for it.”Mrs. Harker began to blush, and taking a paper from her pockets, shesaid:--“Dr. Van Helsing, will you read this, and tell me if it must go in. Itis my record of to-day. I too have seen the need of putting down atpresent everything, however trivial; but there is little in this exceptwhat is personal. Must it go in?” The Professor read it over gravely,and handed it back, saying:--“It need not go in if you do not wish it; but I pray that it may. It canbut make your husband love you the more, and all us, your friends, morehonour you--as well as more esteem and love.” She took it back withanother blush and a bright smile.And so now, up to this very hour, all the records we have are completeand in order. The Professor took away one copy to study after dinner,and before our meeting, which is fixed for nine o’clock. The rest of ushave already read everything; so when we meet in the study we shall allbe informed as to facts, and can arrange our plan of battle with thisterrible and mysterious enemy._Mina Harker’s Journal.__30 September._--When we met in Dr. Seward’s study two hours afterdinner, which had been at six o’clock, we unconsciously formed a sort ofboard or committee. Professor Van Helsing took the head of the table, towhich Dr. Seward motioned him as he came into the room. He made me sitnext to him on his right, and asked me to act as secretary; Jonathan satnext to me. Opposite us were Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr.Morris--Lord Godalming being next the Professor, and Dr. Seward in thecentre. The Professor said:--“I may, I suppose, take it that we are all acquainted with the factsthat are in these papers.” We all expressed assent, and he went on:--“Then it were, I think good that I tell you something of the kind ofenemy with which we have to deal. I shall then make known to yousomething of the history of this man, which has been ascertained for me.So we then can discuss how we shall act, and can take our measureaccording.“There are such beings as vampires; some of us have evidence that theyexist. Even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience, theteachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sanepeoples. I admit that at the first I was sceptic. Were it not thatthrough long years I have train myself to keep an open mind, I could nothave believe until such time as that fact thunder on my ear. ‘See! see!I prove; I prove.’ Alas! Had I known at the first what now I know--nay,had I even guess at him--one so precious life had been spared to many ofus who did love her. But that is gone; and we must so work, that otherpoor souls perish not, whilst we can save. The _nosferatu_ do not dielike the bee when he sting once. He is only stronger; and beingstronger, have yet more power to work evil. This vampire which isamongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenty men; he is ofcunning more than mortal, for his cunning be the growth of ages; he havestill the aids of necromancy, which is, as his etymology imply, thedivination by the dead, and all the dead that he can come nigh to arefor him at command; he is brute, and more than brute; he is devil incallous, and the heart of him is not; he can, within limitations, appearat will when, and where, and in any of the forms that are to him; hecan, within his range, direct the elements; the storm, the fog, thethunder; he can command all the meaner things: the rat, and the owl, andthe bat--the moth, and the fox, and the wolf; he can grow and becomesmall; and he can at times vanish and come unknown. How then are we tobegin our strike to destroy him? How shall we find his where; and havingfound it, how can we destroy? My friends, this is much; it is a terribletask that we undertake, and there may be consequence to make the braveshudder. For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win; and thenwhere end we? Life is nothings; I heed him not. But to fail here, is notmere life or death. It is that we become as him; that we henceforwardbecome foul things of the night like him--without heart or conscience,preying on the bodies and the souls of those we love best. To us forever are the gates of heaven shut; for who shall open them to us again?We go on for all time abhorred by all; a blot on the face of God’ssunshine; an arrow in the side of Him who died for man. But we are faceto face with duty; and in such case must we shrink? For me, I say, no;but then I am old, and life, with his sunshine, his fair places, hissong of birds, his music and his love, lie far behind. You others areyoung. Some have seen sorrow; but there are fair days yet in store. Whatsay you?”Whilst he was speaking, Jonathan had taken my hand. I feared, oh somuch, that the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming him when Isaw his hand stretch out; but it was life to me to feel its touch--sostrong, so self-reliant, so resolute. A brave man’s hand can speak foritself; it does not even need a woman’s love to hear its music.When the Professor had done speaking my husband looked in my eyes, and Iin his; there was no need for speaking between us.“I answer for Mina and myself,” he said.“Count me in, Professor,” said Mr. Quincey Morris, laconically as usual.“I am with you,” said Lord Godalming, “for Lucy’s sake, if for no otherreason.”Dr. Seward simply nodded. The Professor stood up and, after laying hisgolden crucifix on the table, held out his hand on either side. I tookhis right hand, and Lord Godalming his left; Jonathan held my right withhis left and stretched across to Mr. Morris. So as we all took hands oursolemn compact was made. I felt my heart icy cold, but it did not evenoccur to me to draw back. We resumed our places, and Dr. Van Helsingwent on with a sort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious workhad begun. It was to be taken as gravely, and in as businesslike a way,as any other transaction of life:--“Well, you know what we have to contend against; but we, too, are notwithout strength. We have on our side power of combination--a powerdenied to the vampire kind; we have sources of science; we are free toact and think; and the hours of the day and the night are ours equally.In fact, so far as our powers extend, they are unfettered, and we arefree to use them. We have self-devotion in a cause, and an end toachieve which is not a selfish one. These things are much.“Now let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us arerestrict, and how the individual cannot. In fine, let us consider thelimitations of the vampire in general, and of this one in particular.“All we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions. These do notat the first appear much, when the matter is one of life and death--nayof more than either life or death. Yet must we be satisfied; in thefirst place because we have to be--no other means is at our control--andsecondly, because, after all, these things--tradition andsuperstition--are everything. Does not the belief in vampires rest forothers--though not, alas! for us--on them? A year ago which of us wouldhave received such a possibility, in the midst of our scientific,sceptical, matter-of-fact nineteenth century? We even scouted a beliefthat we saw justified under our very eyes. Take it, then, that thevampire, and the belief in his limitations and his cure, rest for themoment on the same base. For, let me tell you, he is known everywherethat men have been. In old Greece, in old Rome; he flourish in Germanyall over, in France, in India, even in the Chernosese; and in China, sofar from us in all ways, there even is he, and the peoples fear him atthis day. He have follow the wake of the berserker Icelander, thedevil-begotten Hun, the Slav, the Saxon, the Magyar. So far, then, wehave all we may act upon; and let me tell you that very much of thebeliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappyexperience. The vampire live on, and cannot die by mere passing of thetime; he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of theliving. Even more, we have seen amongst us that he can even growyounger; that his vital faculties grow strenuous, and seem as thoughthey refresh themselves when his special pabulum is plenty. But hecannot flourish without this diet; he eat not as others. Even friendJonathan, who lived with him for weeks, did never see him to eat, never!He throws no shadow; he make in the mirror no reflect, as againJonathan observe. He has the strength of many of his hand--witness againJonathan when he shut the door against the wolfs, and when he help himfrom the diligence too. He can transform himself to wolf, as we gatherfrom the ship arrival in Whitby, when he tear open the dog; he can be asbat, as Madam Mina saw him on the window at Whitby, and as friend Johnsaw him fly from this so near house, and as my friend Quincey saw him atthe window of Miss Lucy. He can come in mist which he create--that nobleship’s captain proved him of this; but, from what we know, the distancehe can make this mist is limited, and it can only be round himself. Hecome on moonlight rays as elemental dust--as again Jonathan saw thosesisters in the castle of Dracula. He become so small--we ourselves sawMiss Lucy, ere she was at peace, slip through a hairbreadth space at thetomb door. He can, when once he find his way, come out from anything orinto anything, no matter how close it be bound or even fused up withfire--solder you call it. He can see in the dark--no small power this,in a world which is one half shut from the light. Ah, but hear methrough. He can do all these things, yet he is not free. Nay; he is evenmore prisoner than the slave of the galley, than the madman in his cell.He cannot go where he lists; he who is not of nature has yet to obeysome of nature’s laws--why we know not. He may not enter anywhere at thefirst, unless there be some one of the household who bid him to come;though afterwards he can come as he please. His power ceases, as doesthat of all evil things, at the coming of the day. Only at certain timescan he have limited freedom. If he be not at the place whither he isbound, he can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset.These things are we told, and in this record of ours we have proof byinference. Thus, whereas he can do as he will within his limit, when hehave his earth-home, his coffin-home, his hell-home, the placeunhallowed, as we saw when he went to the grave of the suicide atWhitby; still at other time he can only change when the time come. It issaid, too, that he can only pass running water at the slack or the floodof the tide. Then there are things which so afflict him that he has nopower, as the garlic that we know of; and as for things sacred, as thissymbol, my crucifix, that was amongst us even now when we resolve, tothem he is nothing, but in their presence he take his place far off andsilent with respect. There are others, too, which I shall tell you of,lest in our seeking we may need them. The branch of wild rose on hiscoffin keep him that he move not from it; a sacred bullet fired into thecoffin kill him so that he be true dead; and as for the stake throughhim, we know already of its peace; or the cut-off head that giveth rest.We have seen it with our eyes.“Thus when we find the habitation of this man-that-was, we can confinehim to his coffin and destroy him, if we obey what we know. But he isclever. I have asked my friend Arminius, of Buda-Pesth University, tomake his record; and, from all the means that are, he tell me of what hehas been. He must, indeed, have been that Voivode Dracula who won hisname against the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier ofTurkey-land. If it be so, then was he no common man; for in that time,and for centuries after, he was spoken of as the cleverest and the mostcunning, as well as the bravest of the sons of the ‘land beyond theforest.’ That mighty brain and that iron resolution went with him to hisgrave, and are even now arrayed against us. The Draculas were, saysArminius, a great and noble race, though now and again were scions whowere held by their coevals to have had dealings with the Evil One. Theylearned his secrets in the Scholomance, amongst the mountains over LakeHermanstadt, where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due. In therecords are such words as ‘stregoica’--witch, ‘ordog,’ and‘pokol’--Satan and hell; and in one manuscript this very Dracula isspoken of as ‘wampyr,’ which we all understand too well. There have beenfrom the loins of this very one great men and good women, and theirgraves make sacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell. For itis not the least of its terrors that this evil thing is rooted deep inall good; in soil barren of holy memories it cannot rest.”Whilst they were talking Mr. Morris was looking steadily at the window,and he now got up quietly, and went out of the room. There was a littlepause, and then the Professor went on:--“And now we must settle what we do. We have here much data, and we mustproceed to lay out our campaign. We know from the inquiry of Jonathanthat from the castle to Whitby came fifty boxes of earth, all of whichwere delivered at Carfax; we also know that at least some of these boxeshave been removed. It seems to me, that our first step should be toascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond that wallwhere we look to-day; or whether any more have been removed. If thelatter, we must trace----”Here we were interrupted in a very startling way. Outside the house camethe sound of a pistol-shot; the glass of the window was shattered with abullet, which, ricochetting from the top of the embrasure, struck thefar wall of the room. I am afraid I am at heart a coward, for I shriekedout. The men all jumped to their feet; Lord Godalming flew over to thewindow and threw up the sash. As he did so we heard Mr. Morris’s voicewithout:--“Sorry! I fear I have alarmed you. I shall come in and tell you aboutit.” A minute later he came in and said:--“It was an idiotic thing of me to do, and I ask your pardon, Mrs.Harker, most sincerely; I fear I must have frightened you terribly. Butthe fact is that whilst the Professor was talking there came a big batand sat on the window-sill. I have got such a horror of the damnedbrutes from recent events that I cannot stand them, and I went out tohave a shot, as I have been doing of late of evenings, whenever I haveseen one. You used to laugh at me for it then, Art.”“Did you hit it?” asked Dr. Van Helsing.“I don’t know; I fancy not, for it flew away into the wood.” Withoutsaying any more he took his seat, and the Professor began to resume hisstatement:--“We must trace each of these boxes; and when we are ready, we musteither capture or kill this monster in his lair; or we must, so tospeak, sterilise the earth, so that no more he can seek safety in it.Thus in the end we may find him in his form of man between the hours ofnoon and sunset, and so engage with him when he is at his most weak.“And now for you, Madam Mina, this night is the end until all be well.You are too precious to us to have such risk. When we part to-night, youno more must question. We shall tell you all in good time. We are menand are able to bear; but you must be our star and our hope, and weshall act all the more free that you are not in the danger, such as weare.”All the men, even Jonathan, seemed relieved; but it did not seem to megood that they should brave danger and, perhaps, lessen theirsafety--strength being the best safety--through care of me; but theirminds were made up, and, though it was a bitter pill for me to swallow,I could say nothing, save to accept their chivalrous care of me.Mr. Morris resumed the discussion:--“As there is no time to lose, I vote we have a look at his house rightnow. Time is everything with him; and swift action on our part may saveanother victim.”I own that my heart began to fail me when the time for action came soclose, but I did not say anything, for I had a greater fear that if Iappeared as a drag or a hindrance to their work, they might even leaveme out of their counsels altogether. They have now gone off to Carfax,with means to get into the house.Manlike, they had told me to go to bed and sleep; as if a woman cansleep when those she loves are in danger! I shall lie down and pretendto sleep, lest Jonathan have added anxiety about me when he returns._Dr. Seward’s Diary.__1 October, 4 a. m._--Just as we were about to leave the house, anurgent message was brought to me from Renfield to know if I would seehim at once, as he had something of the utmost importance to say to me.I told the messenger to say that I would attend to his wishes in themorning; I was busy just at the moment. The attendant added:--“He seems very importunate, sir. I have never seen him so eager. I don’tknow but what, if you don’t see him soon, he will have one of hisviolent fits.” I knew the man would not have said this without somecause, so I said: “All right; I’ll go now”; and I asked the others towait a few minutes for me, as I had to go and see my “patient.”“Take me with you, friend John,” said the Professor. “His case in yourdiary interest me much, and it had bearing, too, now and again on _our_case. I should much like to see him, and especial when his mind isdisturbed.”“May I come also?” asked Lord Godalming.“Me too?” said Quincey Morris. “May I come?” said Harker. I nodded, andwe all went down the passage together.We found him in a state of considerable excitement, but far morerational in his speech and manner than I had ever seen him. There was anunusual understanding of himself, which was unlike anything I had evermet with in a lunatic; and he took it for granted that his reasons wouldprevail with others entirely sane. We all four went into the room, butnone of the others at first said anything. His request was that I wouldat once release him from the asylum and send him home. This he backed upwith arguments regarding his complete recovery, and adduced his ownexisting sanity. “I appeal to your friends,” he said, “they will,perhaps, not mind sitting in judgment on my case. By the way, you havenot introduced me.” I was so much astonished, that the oddness ofintroducing a madman in an asylum did not strike me at the moment; and,besides, there was a certain dignity in the man’s manner, so much ofthe habit of equality, that I at once made the introduction: “LordGodalming; Professor Van Helsing; Mr. Quincey Morris, of Texas; Mr.Renfield.” He shook hands with each of them, saying in turn:--“Lord Godalming, I had the honour of seconding your father at theWindham; I grieve to know, by your holding the title, that he is nomore. He was a man loved and honoured by all who knew him; and in hisyouth was, I have heard, the inventor of a burnt rum punch, muchpatronised on Derby night. Mr. Morris, you should be proud of your greatstate. Its reception into the Union was a precedent which may havefar-reaching effects hereafter, when the Pole and the Tropics may holdalliance to the Stars and Stripes. The power of Treaty may yet prove avast engine of enlargement, when the Monroe doctrine takes its trueplace as a political fable. What shall any man say of his pleasure atmeeting Van Helsing? Sir, I make no apology for dropping all forms ofconventional prefix. When an individual has revolutionised therapeuticsby his discovery of the continuous evolution of brain-matter,conventional forms are unfitting, since they would seem to limit him toone of a class. You, gentlemen, who by nationality, by heredity, or bythe possession of natural gifts, are fitted to hold your respectiveplaces in the moving world, I take to witness that I am as sane as atleast the majority of men who are in full possession of their liberties.And I am sure that you, Dr. Seward, humanitarian and medico-jurist aswell as scientist, will deem it a moral duty to deal with me as one tobe considered as under exceptional circumstances.” He made this lastappeal with a courtly air of conviction which was not without its owncharm.I think we were all staggered. For my own part, I was under theconviction, despite my knowledge of the man’s character and history,that his reason had been restored; and I felt under a strong impulse totell him that I was satisfied as to his sanity, and would see about thenecessary formalities for his release in the morning. I thought itbetter to wait, however, before making so grave a statement, for of oldI knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was liable.So I contented myself with making a general statement that he appearedto be improving very rapidly; that I would have a longer chat with himin the morning, and would then see what I could do in the direction ofmeeting his wishes. This did not at all satisfy him, for he saidquickly:--“But I fear, Dr. Seward, that you hardly apprehend my wish. I desire togo at once--here--now--this very hour--this very moment, if I may. Timepresses, and in our implied agreement with the old scytheman it is ofthe essence of the contract. I am sure it is only necessary to putbefore so admirable a practitioner as Dr. Seward so simple, yet somomentous a wish, to ensure its fulfilment.” He looked at me keenly, andseeing the negative in my face, turned to the others, and scrutinisedthem closely. Not meeting any sufficient response, he went on:--“Is it possible that I have erred in my supposition?”“You have,” I said frankly, but at the same time, as I felt, brutally.There was a considerable pause, and then he said slowly:--“Then I suppose I must only shift my ground of request. Let me ask forthis concession--boon, privilege, what you will. I am content to implorein such a case, not on personal grounds, but for the sake of others. Iam not at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons; but you may, Iassure you, take it from me that they are good ones, sound andunselfish, and spring from the highest sense of duty. Could you look,sir, into my heart, you would approve to the full the sentiments whichanimate me. Nay, more, you would count me amongst the best and truest ofyour friends.” Again he looked at us all keenly. I had a growingconviction that this sudden change of his entire intellectual method wasbut yet another form or phase of his madness, and so determined to lethim go on a little longer, knowing from experience that he would, likeall lunatics, give himself away in the end. Van Helsing was gazing athim with a look of utmost intensity, his bushy eyebrows almost meetingwith the fixed concentration of his look. He said to Renfield in a tonewhich did not surprise me at the time, but only when I thought of itafterwards--for it was as of one addressing an equal:--“Can you not tell frankly your real reason for wishing to be freeto-night? I will undertake that if you will satisfy even me--a stranger,without prejudice, and with the habit of keeping an open mind--Dr.Seward will give you, at his own risk and on his own responsibility, theprivilege you seek.” He shook his head sadly, and with a look ofpoignant regret on his face. The Professor went on:--“Come, sir, bethink yourself. You claim the privilege of reason in thehighest degree, since you seek to impress us with your completereasonableness. You do this, whose sanity we have reason to doubt, sinceyou are not yet released from medical treatment for this very defect. Ifyou will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest course, how canwe perform the duty which you yourself put upon us? Be wise, and helpus; and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish.” He still shookhis head as he said:--“Dr. Van Helsing, I have nothing to say. Your argument is complete, andif I were free to speak I should not hesitate a moment; but I am not myown master in the matter. I can only ask you to trust me. If I amrefused, the responsibility does not rest with me.” I thought it was nowtime to end the scene, which was becoming too comically grave, so I wenttowards the door, simply saying:--“Come, my friends, we have work to do. Good-night.”As, however, I got near the door, a new change came over the patient. Hemoved towards me so quickly that for the moment I feared that he wasabout to make another homicidal attack. My fears, however, weregroundless, for he held up his two hands imploringly, and made hispetition in a moving manner. As he saw that the very excess of hisemotion was militating against him, by restoring us more to our oldrelations, he became still more demonstrative. I glanced at Van Helsing,and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes; so I became a little morefixed in my manner, if not more stern, and motioned to him that hisefforts were unavailing. I had previously seen something of the sameconstantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some request ofwhich at the time he had thought much, such, for instance, as when hewanted a cat; and I was prepared to see the collapse into the samesullen acquiescence on this occasion. My expectation was not realised,for, when he found that his appeal would not be successful, he got intoquite a frantic condition. He threw himself on his knees, and held uphis hands, wringing them in plaintive supplication, and poured forth atorrent of entreaty, with the tears rolling down his cheeks, and hiswhole face and form expressive of the deepest emotion:--“Let me entreat you, Dr. Seward, oh, let me implore you, to let me outof this house at once. Send me away how you will and where you will;send keepers with me with whips and chains; let them take me in astrait-waistcoat, manacled and leg-ironed, even to a gaol; but let me goout of this. You don’t know what you do by keeping me here. I amspeaking from the depths of my heart--of my very soul. You don’t knowwhom you wrong, or how; and I may not tell. Woe is me! I may not tell.By all you hold sacred--by all you hold dear--by your love that islost--by your hope that lives--for the sake of the Almighty, take me outof this and save my soul from guilt! Can’t you hear me, man? Can’t youunderstand? Will you never learn? Don’t you know that I am sane andearnest now; that I am no lunatic in a mad fit, but a sane man fightingfor his soul? Oh, hear me! hear me! Let me go! let me go! let me go!”I thought that the longer this went on the wilder he would get, and sowould bring on a fit; so I took him by the hand and raised him up.“Come,” I said sternly, “no more of this; we have had quite enoughalready. Get to your bed and try to behave more discreetly.”He suddenly stopped and looked at me intently for several moments. Then,without a word, he rose and moving over, sat down on the side of thebed. The collapse had come, as on former occasion, just as I hadexpected.When I was leaving the room, last of our party, he said to me in aquiet, well-bred voice:--“You will, I trust, Dr. Seward, do me the justice to bear in mind, lateron, that I did what I could to convince you to-night.”CHAPTER XIXJONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL_1 October, 5 a. m._--I went with the party to the search with an easymind, for I think I never saw Mina so absolutely strong and well. I amso glad that she consented to hold back and let us men do the work.Somehow, it was a dread to me that she was in this fearful business atall; but now that her work is done, and that it is due to her energy andbrains and foresight that the whole story is put together in such a waythat every point tells, she may well feel that her part is finished, andthat she can henceforth leave the rest to us. We were, I think, all alittle upset by the scene with Mr. Renfield. When we came away from hisroom we were silent till we got back to the study. Then Mr. Morris saidto Dr. Seward:--“Say, Jack, if that man wasn’t attempting a bluff, he is about thesanest lunatic I ever saw. I’m not sure, but I believe that he had someserious purpose, and if he had, it was pretty rough on him not to get achance.” Lord Godalming and I were silent, but Dr. Van Helsing added:--“Friend John, you know more of lunatics than I do, and I’m glad of it,for I fear that if it had been to me to decide I would before that lasthysterical outburst have given him free. But we live and learn, and inour present task we must take no chance, as my friend Quincey would say.All is best as they are.” Dr. Seward seemed to answer them both in adreamy kind of way:--“I don’t know but that I agree with you. If that man had been anordinary lunatic I would have taken my chance of trusting him; but heseems so mixed up with the Count in an indexy kind of way that I amafraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads. I can’t forget howhe prayed with almost equal fervour for a cat, and then tried to tear mythroat out with his teeth. Besides, he called the Count ‘lord andmaster,’ and he may want to get out to help him in some diabolical way.That horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to helphim, so I suppose he isn’t above trying to use a respectable lunatic. Hecertainly did seem earnest, though. I only hope we have done what isbest. These things, in conjunction with the wild work we have in hand,help to unnerve a man.” The Professor stepped over, and laying his handon his shoulder, said in his grave, kindly way:--“Friend John, have no fear. We are trying to do our duty in a very sadand terrible case; we can only do as we deem best. What else have we tohope for, except the pity of the good God?” Lord Godalming had slippedaway for a few minutes, but now he returned. He held up a little silverwhistle, as he remarked:--“That old place may be full of rats, and if so, I’ve got an antidote oncall.” Having passed the wall, we took our way to the house, taking careto keep in the shadows of the trees on the lawn when the moonlight shoneout. When we got to the porch the Professor opened his bag and took outa lot of things, which he laid on the step, sorting them into fourlittle groups, evidently one for each. Then he spoke:--“My friends, we are going into a terrible danger, and we need arms ofmany kinds. Our enemy is not merely spiritual. Remember that he has thestrength of twenty men, and that, though our necks or our windpipes areof the common kind--and therefore breakable or crushable--his are notamenable to mere strength. A stronger man, or a body of men more strongin all than him, can at certain times hold him; but they cannot hurt himas we can be hurt by him. We must, therefore, guard ourselves from histouch. Keep this near your heart”--as he spoke he lifted a little silvercrucifix and held it out to me, I being nearest to him--“put theseflowers round your neck”--here he handed to me a wreath of witheredgarlic blossoms--“for other enemies more mundane, this revolver and thisknife; and for aid in all, these so small electric lamps, which you canfasten to your breast; and for all, and above all at the last, this,which we must not desecrate needless.” This was a portion of SacredWafer, which he put in an envelope and handed to me. Each of the otherswas similarly equipped. “Now,” he said, “friend John, where are theskeleton keys? If so that we can open the door, we need not break houseby the window, as before at Miss Lucy’s.”Dr. Seward tried one or two skeleton keys, his mechanical dexterity as asurgeon standing him in good stead. Presently he got one to suit; aftera little play back and forward the bolt yielded, and, with a rustyclang, shot back. We pressed on the door, the rusty hinges creaked, andit slowly opened. It was startlingly like the image conveyed to me inDr. Seward’s diary of the opening of Miss Westenra’s tomb; I fancy thatthe same idea seemed to strike the others, for with one accord theyshrank back. The Professor was the first to move forward, and steppedinto the open door.“_In manus tuas, Domine!_” he said, crossing himself as he passed overthe threshold. We closed the door behind us, lest when we should havelit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the road. TheProfessor carefully tried the lock, lest we might not be able to open itfrom within should we be in a hurry making our exit. Then we all lit ourlamps and proceeded on our search.The light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms, as therays crossed each other, or the opacity of our bodies threw greatshadows. I could not for my life get away from the feeling that therewas some one else amongst us. I suppose it was the recollection, sopowerfully brought home to me by the grim surroundings, of that terribleexperience in Transylvania. I think the feeling was common to us all,for I noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders at everysound and every new shadow, just as I felt myself doing.The whole place was thick with dust. The floor was seemingly inchesdeep, except where there were recent footsteps, in which on holding downmy lamp I could see marks of hobnails where the dust was cracked. Thewalls were fluffy and heavy with dust, and in the corners were masses ofspider’s webs, whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like oldtattered rags as the weight had torn them partly down. On a table in thehall was a great bunch of keys, with a time-yellowed label on each. Theyhad been used several times, for on the table were several similar rentsin the blanket of dust, similar to that exposed when the Professorlifted them. He turned to me and said:--“You know this place, Jonathan. You have copied maps of it, and you knowit at least more than we do. Which is the way to the chapel?” I had anidea of its direction, though on my former visit I had not been able toget admission to it; so I led the way, and after a few wrong turningsfound myself opposite a low, arched oaken door, ribbed with iron bands.“This is the spot,” said the Professor as he turned his lamp on a smallmap of the house, copied from the file of my original correspondenceregarding the purchase. With a little trouble we found the key on thebunch and opened the door. We were prepared for some unpleasantness, foras we were opening the door a faint, malodorous air seemed to exhalethrough the gaps, but none of us ever expected such an odour as weencountered. None of the others had met the Count at all at closequarters, and when I had seen him he was either in the fasting stage ofhis existence in his rooms or, when he was gloated with fresh blood, ina ruined building open to the air; but here the place was small andclose, and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul. There wasan earthy smell, as of some dry miasma, which came through the foulerair. But as to the odour itself, how shall I describe it? It was notalone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and with thepungent, acrid smell of blood, but it seemed as though corruption hadbecome itself corrupt. Faugh! it sickens me to think of it. Every breathexhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place andintensified its loathsomeness.Under ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought ourenterprise to an end; but this was no ordinary case, and the high andterrible purpose in which we were involved gave us a strength which roseabove merely physical considerations. After the involuntary shrinkingconsequent on the first nauseous whiff, we one and all set about ourwork as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses.We made an accurate examination of the place, the Professor saying as webegan:--“The first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left; we must thenexamine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannot get someclue as to what has become of the rest.” A glance was sufficient to showhow many remained, for the great earth chests were bulky, and there wasno mistaking them.There were only twenty-nine left out of the fifty! Once I got a fright,for, seeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulteddoor into the dark passage beyond, I looked too, and for an instant myheart stood still. Somewhere, looking out from the shadow, I seemed tosee the high lights of the Count’s evil face, the ridge of the nose, thered eyes, the red lips, the awful pallor. It was only for a moment, for,as Lord Godalming said, “I thought I saw a face, but it was only theshadows,” and resumed his inquiry, I turned my lamp in the direction,and stepped into the passage. There was no sign of any one; and as therewere no corners, no doors, no aperture of any kind, but only the solidwalls of the passage, there could be no hiding-place even for _him_. Itook it that fear had helped imagination, and said nothing.A few minutes later I saw Morris step suddenly back from a corner, whichhe was examining. We all followed his movements with our eyes, forundoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us, and we saw a whole massof phosphorescence, which twinkled like stars. We all instinctively drewback. The whole place was becoming alive with rats.For a moment or two we stood appalled, all save Lord Godalming, who wasseemingly prepared for such an emergency. Rushing over to the greatiron-bound oaken door, which Dr. Seward had described from the outside,and which I had seen myself, he turned the key in the lock, drew thehuge bolts, and swung the door open. Then, taking his little silverwhistle from his pocket, he blew a low, shrill call. It was answeredfrom behind Dr. Seward’s house by the yelping of dogs, and after about aminute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house.Unconsciously we had all moved towards the door, and as we moved Inoticed that the dust had been much disturbed: the boxes which had beentaken out had been brought this way. But even in the minute that hadelapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased. They seemed toswarm over the place all at once, till the lamplight, shining on theirmoving dark bodies and glittering, baleful eyes, made the place looklike a bank of earth set with fireflies. The dogs dashed on, but at thethreshold suddenly stopped and snarled, and then, simultaneously liftingtheir noses, began to howl in most lugubrious fashion. The rats weremultiplying in thousands, and we moved out.Lord Godalming lifted one of the dogs, and carrying him in, placed himon the floor. The instant his feet touched the ground he seemed torecover his courage, and rushed at his natural enemies. They fled beforehim so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score, the otherdogs, who had by now been lifted in the same manner, had but small preyere the whole mass had vanished.With their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed, forthe dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts attheir prostrate foes, and turned them over and over and tossed them inthe air with vicious shakes. We all seemed to find our spirits rise.Whether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening ofthe chapel door, or the relief which we experienced by finding ourselvesin the open I know not; but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed toslip from us like a robe, and the occasion of our coming lost somethingof its grim significance, though we did not slacken a whit in ourresolution. We closed the outer door and barred and locked it, andbringing the dogs with us, began our search of the house. We foundnothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions, and alluntouched save for my own footsteps when I had made my first visit.Never once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness, and even whenwe returned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had beenrabbit-hunting in a summer wood.The morning was quickening in the east when we emerged from the front.Dr. Van Helsing had taken the key of the hall-door from the bunch, andlocked the door in orthodox fashion, putting the key into his pocketwhen he had done.“So far,” he said, “our night has been eminently successful. No harm hascome to us such as I feared might be and yet we have ascertained howmany boxes are missing. More than all do I rejoice that this, ourfirst--and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous--step has beenaccomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet Madam Mina ortroubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds andsmells of horror which she might never forget. One lesson, too, we havelearned, if it be allowable to argue _a particulari_: that the brutebeasts which are to the Count’s command are yet themselves not amenableto his spiritual power; for look, these rats that would come to hiscall, just as from his castle top he summon the wolves to your going andto that poor mother’s cry, though they come to him, they run pell-mellfrom the so little dogs of my friend Arthur. We have other mattersbefore us, other dangers, other fears; and that monster--he has not usedhis power over the brute world for the only or the last time to-night.So be it that he has gone elsewhere. Good! It has given us opportunityto cry ‘check’ in some ways in this chess game, which we play for thestake of human souls. And now let us go home. The dawn is close at hand,and we have reason to be content with our first night’s work. It may beordained that we have many nights and days to follow, if full of peril;but we must go on, and from no danger shall we shrink.”The house was silent when we got back, save for some poor creature whowas screaming away in one of the distant wards, and a low, moaning soundfrom Renfield’s room. The poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself,after the manner of the insane, with needless thoughts of pain.I came tiptoe into our own room, and found Mina asleep, breathing sosoftly that I had to put my ear down to hear it. She looks paler thanusual. I hope the meeting to-night has not upset her. I am trulythankful that she is to be left out of our future work, and even of ourdeliberations. It is too great a strain for a woman to bear. I did notthink so at first, but I know better now. Therefore I am glad that it issettled. There may be things which would frighten her to hear; and yetto conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her if once shesuspected that there was any concealment. Henceforth our work is to be asealed book to her, till at least such time as we can tell her that allis finished, and the earth free from a monster of the nether world. Idaresay it will be difficult to begin to keep silence after suchconfidence as ours; but I must be resolute, and to-morrow I shall keepdark over to-night’s doings, and shall refuse to speak of anything thathas happened. I rest on the sofa, so as not to disturb her.*       *       *       *       *_1 October, later._--I suppose it was natural that we should have alloverslept ourselves, for the day was a busy one, and the night had norest at all. Even Mina must have felt its exhaustion, for though I slepttill the sun was high, I was awake before her, and had to call two orthree times before she awoke. Indeed, she was so sound asleep that for afew seconds she did not recognize me, but looked at me with a sort ofblank terror, as one looks who has been waked out of a bad dream. Shecomplained a little of being tired, and I let her rest till later in theday. We now know of twenty-one boxes having been removed, and if it bethat several were taken in any of these removals we may be able to tracethem all. Such will, of course, immensely simplify our labour, and thesooner the matter is attended to the better. I shall look up ThomasSnelling to-day._Dr. Seward’s Diary.__1 October._--It was towards noon when I was awakened by the Professorwalking into my room. He was more jolly and cheerful than usual, and itis quite evident that last night’s work has helped to take some of thebrooding weight off his mind. After going over the adventure of thenight he suddenly said:--“Your patient interests me much. May it be that with you I visit himthis morning? Or if that you are too occupy, I can go alone if it maybe. It is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophy,and reason so sound.” I had some work to do which pressed, so I told himthat if he would go alone I would be glad, as then I should not have tokeep him waiting; so I called an attendant and gave him the necessaryinstructions. Before the Professor left the room I cautioned him againstgetting any false impression from my patient. “But,” he answered, “Iwant him to talk of himself and of his delusion as to consuming livethings. He said to Madam Mina, as I see in your diary of yesterday, thathe had once had such a belief. Why do you smile, friend John?”“Excuse me,” I said, “but the answer is here.” I laid my hand on thetype-written matter. “When our sane and learned lunatic made that verystatement of how he _used_ to consume life, his mouth was actuallynauseous with the flies and spiders which he had eaten just before Mrs.Harker entered the room.” Van Helsing smiled in turn. “Good!” he said.“Your memory is true, friend John. I should have remembered. And yet itis this very obliquity of thought and memory which makes mental diseasesuch a fascinating study. Perhaps I may gain more knowledge out of thefolly of this madman than I shall from the teaching of the most wise.Who knows?” I went on with my work, and before long was through that inhand. It seemed that the time had been very short indeed, but there wasVan Helsing back in the study. “Do I interrupt?” he asked politely as hestood at the door.“Not at all,” I answered. “Come in. My work is finished, and I am free.I can go with you now, if you like.“It is needless; I have seen him!”“Well?”“I fear that he does not appraise me at much. Our interview was short.When I entered his room he was sitting on a stool in the centre, withhis elbows on his knees, and his face was the picture of sullendiscontent. I spoke to him as cheerfully as I could, and with such ameasure of respect as I could assume. He made no reply whatever. “Don’tyou know me?” I asked. His answer was not reassuring: “I know you wellenough; you are the old fool Van Helsing. I wish you would take yourselfand your idiotic brain theories somewhere else. Damn all thick-headedDutchmen!” Not a word more would he say, but sat in his implacablesullenness as indifferent to me as though I had not been in the room atall. Thus departed for this time my chance of much learning from this soclever lunatic; so I shall go, if I may, and cheer myself with a fewhappy words with that sweet soul Madam Mina. Friend John, it doesrejoice me unspeakable that she is no more to be pained, no more to beworried with our terrible things. Though we shall much miss her help, itis better so.”“I agree with you with all my heart,” I answered earnestly, for I didnot want him to weaken in this matter. “Mrs. Harker is better out of it.Things are quite bad enough for us, all men of the world, and who havebeen in many tight places in our time; but it is no place for a woman,and if she had remained in touch with the affair, it would in timeinfallibly have wrecked her.”So Van Helsing has gone to confer with Mrs. Harker and Harker; Quinceyand Art are all out following up the clues as to the earth-boxes. Ishall finish my round of work and we shall meet to-night._Mina Harker’s Journal.__1 October._--It is strange to me to be kept in the dark as I am to-day;after Jonathan’s full confidence for so many years, to see himmanifestly avoid certain matters, and those the most vital of all. Thismorning I slept late after the fatigues of yesterday, and thoughJonathan was late too, he was the earlier. He spoke to me before he wentout, never more sweetly or tenderly, but he never mentioned a word ofwhat had happened in the visit to the Count’s house. And yet he musthave known how terribly anxious I was. Poor dear fellow! I suppose itmust have distressed him even more than it did me. They all agreed thatit was best that I should not be drawn further into this awful work, andI acquiesced. But to think that he keeps anything from me! And now I amcrying like a silly fool, when I _know_ it comes from my husband’s greatlove and from the good, good wishes of those other strong men.That has done me good. Well, some day Jonathan will tell me all; andlest it should ever be that he should think for a moment that I keptanything from him, I still keep my journal as usual. Then if he hasfeared of my trust I shall show it to him, with every thought of myheart put down for his dear eyes to read. I feel strangely sad andlow-spirited to-day. I suppose it is the reaction from the terribleexcitement.Last night I went to bed when the men had gone, simply because they toldme to. I didn’t feel sleepy, and I did feel full of devouring anxiety. Ikept thinking over everything that has been ever since Jonathan came tosee me in London, and it all seems like a horrible tragedy, with fatepressing on relentlessly to some destined end. Everything that one doesseems, no matter how right it may be, to bring on the very thing whichis most to be deplored. If I hadn’t gone to Whitby, perhaps poor dearLucy would be with us now. She hadn’t taken to visiting the churchyardtill I came, and if she hadn’t come there in the day-time with me shewouldn’t have walked there in her sleep; and if she hadn’t gone there atnight and asleep, that monster couldn’t have destroyed her as he did.Oh, why did I ever go to Whitby? There now, crying again! I wonder whathas come over me to-day. I must hide it from Jonathan, for if he knewthat I had been crying twice in one morning--I, who never cried on myown account, and whom he has never caused to shed a tear--the dearfellow would fret his heart out. I shall put a bold face on, and if I dofeel weepy, he shall never see it. I suppose it is one of the lessonsthat we poor women have to learn....I can’t quite remember how I fell asleep last night. I remember hearingthe sudden barking of the dogs and a lot of queer sounds, like prayingon a very tumultuous scale, from Mr. Renfield’s room, which is somewhereunder this. And then there was silence over everything, silence soprofound that it startled me, and I got up and looked out of the window.All was dark and silent, the black shadows thrown by the moonlightseeming full of a silent mystery of their own. Not a thing seemed to bestirring, but all to be grim and fixed as death or fate; so that a thinstreak of white mist, that crept with almost imperceptible slownessacross the grass towards the house, seemed to have a sentience and avitality of its own. I think that the digression of my thoughts musthave done me good, for when I got back to bed I found a lethargycreeping over me. I lay a while, but could not quite sleep, so I got outand looked out of the window again. The mist was spreading, and was nowclose up to the house, so that I could see it lying thick against thewall, as though it were stealing up to the windows. The poor man wasmore loud than ever, and though I could not distinguish a word he said,I could in some way recognise in his tones some passionate entreaty onhis part. Then there was the sound of a struggle, and I knew that theattendants were dealing with him. I was so frightened that I crept intobed, and pulled the clothes over my head, putting my fingers in my ears.I was not then a bit sleepy, at least so I thought; but I must havefallen asleep, for, except dreams, I do not remember anything until themorning, when Jonathan woke me. I think that it took me an effort and alittle time to realise where I was, and that it was Jonathan who wasbending over me. My dream was very peculiar, and was almost typical ofthe way that waking thoughts become merged in, or continued in, dreams.I thought that I was asleep, and waiting for Jonathan to come back. Iwas very anxious about him, and I was powerless to act; my feet, and myhands, and my brain were weighted, so that nothing could proceed at theusual pace. And so I slept uneasily and thought. Then it began to dawnupon me that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold. I put back theclothes from my face, and found, to my surprise, that all was dimaround. The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, but turned down,came only like a tiny red spark through the fog, which had evidentlygrown thicker and poured into the room. Then it occurred to me that Ihad shut the window before I had come to bed. I would have got out tomake certain on the point, but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain mylimbs and even my will. I lay still and endured; that was all. I closedmy eyes, but could still see through my eyelids. (It is wonderful whattricks our dreams play us, and how conveniently we can imagine.) Themist grew thicker and thicker and I could see now how it came in, for Icould see it like smoke--or with the white energy of boilingwater--pouring in, not through the window, but through the joinings ofthe door. It got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it becameconcentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room, through the topof which I could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye. Thingsbegan to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column was nowwhirling in the room, and through it all came the scriptural words “apillar of cloud by day and of fire by night.” Was it indeed some suchspiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep? But the pillar wascomposed of both the day and the night-guiding, for the fire was in thered eye, which at the thought got a new fascination for me; till, as Ilooked, the fire divided, and seemed to shine on me through the fog liketwo red eyes, such as Lucy told me of in her momentary mental wanderingwhen, on the cliff, the dying sunlight struck the windows of St. Mary’sChurch. Suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus that Jonathanhad seen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling mistin the moonlight, and in my dream I must have fainted, for all becameblack darkness. The last conscious effort which imagination made was toshow me a livid white face bending over me out of the mist. I must becareful of such dreams, for they would unseat one’s reason if there weretoo much of them. I would get Dr. Van Helsing or Dr. Seward to prescribesomething for me which would make me sleep, only that I fear to alarmthem. Such a dream at the present time would become woven into theirfears for me. To-night I shall strive hard to sleep naturally. If I donot, I shall to-morrow night get them to give me a dose of chloral; thatcannot hurt me for once, and it will give me a good night’s sleep. Lastnight tired me more than if I had not slept at all.*       *       *       *       *_2 October 10 p. m._--Last night I slept, but did not dream. I must haveslept soundly, for I was not waked by Jonathan coming to bed; but thesleep has not refreshed me, for to-day I feel terribly weak andspiritless. I spent all yesterday trying to read, or lying down dozing.In the afternoon Mr. Renfield asked if he might see me. Poor man, he wasvery gentle, and when I came away he kissed my hand and bade God blessme. Some way it affected me much; I am crying when I think of him. Thisis a new weakness, of which I must be careful. Jonathan would bemiserable if he knew I had been crying. He and the others were out tilldinner-time, and they all came in tired. I did what I could to brightenthem up, and I suppose that the effort did me good, for I forgot howtired I was. After dinner they sent me to bed, and all went off to smoketogether, as they said, but I knew that they wanted to tell each otherof what had occurred to each during the day; I could see from Jonathan’smanner that he had something important to communicate. I was not sosleepy as I should have been; so before they went I asked Dr. Seward togive me a little opiate of some kind, as I had not slept well the nightbefore. He very kindly made me up a sleeping draught, which he gave tome, telling me that it would do me no harm, as it was very mild.... Ihave taken it, and am waiting for sleep, which still keeps aloof. I hopeI have not done wrong, for as sleep begins to flirt with me, a new fearcomes: that I may have been foolish in thus depriving myself of thepower of waking. I might want it. Here comes sleep. Good-night.CHAPTER XXJONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL_1 October, evening._--I found Thomas Snelling in his house at BethnalGreen, but unhappily he was not in a condition to remember anything. Thevery prospect of beer which my expected coming had opened to him hadproved too much, and he had begun too early on his expected debauch. Ilearned, however, from his wife, who seemed a decent, poor soul, that hewas only the assistant to Smollet, who of the two mates was theresponsible person. So off I drove to Walworth, and found Mr. JosephSmollet at home and in his shirtsleeves, taking a late tea out of asaucer. He is a decent, intelligent fellow, distinctly a good, reliabletype of workman, and with a headpiece of his own. He remembered allabout the incident of the boxes, and from a wonderful dog’s-earednotebook, which he produced from some mysterious receptacle about theseat of his trousers, and which had hieroglyphical entries in thick,half-obliterated pencil, he gave me the destinations of the boxes. Therewere, he said, six in the cartload which he took from Carfax and left at197, Chicksand Street, Mile End New Town, and another six which hedeposited at Jamaica Lane, Bermondsey. If then the Count meant toscatter these ghastly refuges of his over London, these places werechosen as the first of delivery, so that later he might distribute morefully. The systematic manner in which this was done made me think thathe could not mean to confine himself to two sides of London. He was nowfixed on the far east of the northern shore, on the east of the southernshore, and on the south. The north and west were surely never meant tobe left out of his diabolical scheme--let alone the City itself and thevery heart of fashionable London in the south-west and west. I went backto Smollet, and asked him if he could tell us if any other boxes hadbeen taken from Carfax.He replied:--“Well, guv’nor, you’ve treated me wery ’an’some”--I had given him half asovereign--“an’ I’ll tell yer all I know. I heard a man by the name ofBloxam say four nights ago in the ’Are an’ ’Ounds, in Pincher’s Alley,as ’ow he an’ his mate ’ad ’ad a rare dusty job in a old ’ouse atPurfect. There ain’t a-many such jobs as this ’ere, an’ I’m thinkin’that maybe Sam Bloxam could tell ye summut.” I asked if he could tell mewhere to find him. I told him that if he could get me the address itwould be worth another half-sovereign to him. So he gulped down the restof his tea and stood up, saying that he was going to begin the searchthen and there. At the door he stopped, and said:--“Look ’ere, guv’nor, there ain’t no sense in me a-keepin’ you ’ere. Imay find Sam soon, or I mayn’t; but anyhow he ain’t like to be in a wayto tell ye much to-night. Sam is a rare one when he starts on the booze.If you can give me a envelope with a stamp on it, and put yer address onit, I’ll find out where Sam is to be found and post it ye to-night. Butye’d better be up arter ’im soon in the mornin’, or maybe ye won’t ketch’im; for Sam gets off main early, never mind the booze the night afore.”This was all practical, so one of the children went off with a penny tobuy an envelope and a sheet of paper, and to keep the change. When shecame back, I addressed the envelope and stamped it, and when Smollet hadagain faithfully promised to post the address when found, I took my wayto home. We’re on the track anyhow. I am tired to-night, and want sleep.Mina is fast asleep, and looks a little too pale; her eyes look asthough she had been crying. Poor dear, I’ve no doubt it frets her to bekept in the dark, and it may make her doubly anxious about me and theothers. But it is best as it is. It is better to be disappointed andworried in such a way now than to have her nerve broken. The doctorswere quite right to insist on her being kept out of this dreadfulbusiness. I must be firm, for on me this particular burden of silencemust rest. I shall not ever enter on the subject with her under anycircumstances. Indeed, it may not be a hard task, after all, for sheherself has become reticent on the subject, and has not spoken of theCount or his doings ever since we told her of our decision.*       *       *       *       *_2 October, evening._--A long and trying and exciting day. By the firstpost I got my directed envelope with a dirty scrap of paper enclosed, onwhich was written with a carpenter’s pencil in a sprawling hand:--“Sam Bloxam, Korkrans, 4, Poters Cort, Bartel Street, Walworth. Arsk forthe depite.”I got the letter in bed, and rose without waking Mina. She looked heavyand sleepy and pale, and far from well. I determined not to wake her,but that, when I should return from this new search, I would arrange forher going back to Exeter. I think she would be happier in our own home,with her daily tasks to interest her, than in being here amongst us andin ignorance. I only saw Dr. Seward for a moment, and told him where Iwas off to, promising to come back and tell the rest so soon as I shouldhave found out anything. I drove to Walworth and found, with somedifficulty, Potter’s Court. Mr. Smollet’s spelling misled me, as I askedfor Poter’s Court instead of Potter’s Court. However, when I had foundthe court, I had no difficulty in discovering Corcoran’s lodging-house.When I asked the man who came to the door for the “depite,” he shook hishead, and said: “I dunno ’im. There ain’t no such a person ’ere; I never’eard of ’im in all my bloomin’ days. Don’t believe there ain’t nobodyof that kind livin’ ere or anywheres.” I took out Smollet’s letter, andas I read it it seemed to me that the lesson of the spelling of the nameof the court might guide me. “What are you?” I asked.“I’m the depity,” he answered. I saw at once that I was on the righttrack; phonetic spelling had again misled me. A half-crown tip put thedeputy’s knowledge at my disposal, and I learned that Mr. Bloxam, whohad slept off the remains of his beer on the previous night atCorcoran’s, had left for his work at Poplar at five o’clock thatmorning. He could not tell me where the place of work was situated, buthe had a vague idea that it was some kind of a “new-fangled ware’us”;and with this slender clue I had to start for Poplar. It was twelveo’clock before I got any satisfactory hint of such a building, and thisI got at a coffee-shop, where some workmen were having their dinner. Oneof these suggested that there was being erected at Cross Angel Street anew “cold storage” building; and as this suited the condition of a“new-fangled ware’us,” I at once drove to it. An interview with a surlygatekeeper and a surlier foreman, both of whom were appeased with thecoin of the realm, put me on the track of Bloxam; he was sent for on mysuggesting that I was willing to pay his day’s wages to his foreman forthe privilege of asking him a few questions on a private matter. He wasa smart enough fellow, though rough of speech and bearing. When I hadpromised to pay for his information and given him an earnest, he told methat he had made two journeys between Carfax and a house in Piccadilly,and had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxes--“mainheavy ones”--with a horse and cart hired by him for this purpose. Iasked him if he could tell me the number of the house in Piccadilly, towhich he replied:--“Well, guv’nor, I forgits the number, but it was only a few doors from abig white church or somethink of the kind, not long built. It was adusty old ’ouse, too, though nothin’ to the dustiness of the ’ouse wetooked the bloomin’ boxes from.”“How did you get into the houses if they were both empty?”“There was the old party what engaged me a-waitin’ in the ’ouse atPurfleet. He ’elped me to lift the boxes and put them in the dray. Curseme, but he was the strongest chap I ever struck, an’ him a old feller,with a white moustache, one that thin you would think he couldn’t throwa shadder.”How this phrase thrilled through me!“Why, ’e took up ’is end o’ the boxes like they was pounds of tea, andme a-puffin’ an’ a-blowin’ afore I could up-end mine anyhow--an’ I’m nochicken, neither.”“How did you get into the house in Piccadilly?” I asked.“He was there too. He must ’a’ started off and got there afore me, forwhen I rung of the bell he kem an’ opened the door ’isself an’ ’elped meto carry the boxes into the ’all.”“The whole nine?” I asked.“Yus; there was five in the first load an’ four in the second. It wasmain dry work, an’ I don’t so well remember ’ow I got ’ome.” Iinterrupted him:--“Were the boxes left in the hall?”“Yus; it was a big ’all, an’ there was nothin’ else in it.” I made onemore attempt to further matters:--“You didn’t have any key?”“Never used no key nor nothink. The old gent, he opened the door ’isselfan’ shut it again when I druv off. I don’t remember the last time--butthat was the beer.”“And you can’t remember the number of the house?”“No, sir. But ye needn’t have no difficulty about that. It’s a ’igh ’unwith a stone front with a bow on it, an’ ’igh steps up to the door. Iknow them steps, ’avin’ ’ad to carry the boxes up with three loaferswhat come round to earn a copper. The old gent give them shillin’s, an’they seein’ they got so much, they wanted more; but ’e took one of themby the shoulder and was like to throw ’im down the steps, till the lotof them went away cussin’.” I thought that with this description I couldfind the house, so, having paid my friend for his information, I startedoff for Piccadilly. I had gained a new painful experience; the Countcould, it was evident, handle the earth-boxes himself. If so, time wasprecious; for, now that he had achieved a certain amount ofdistribution, he could, by choosing his own time, complete the taskunobserved. At Piccadilly Circus I discharged my cab, and walkedwestward; beyond the Junior Constitutional I came across the housedescribed, and was satisfied that this was the next of the lairsarranged by Dracula. The house looked as though it had been longuntenanted. The windows were encrusted with dust, and the shutters wereup. All the framework was black with time, and from the iron the painthad mostly scaled away. It was evident that up to lately there had beena large notice-board in front of the balcony; it had, however, beenroughly torn away, the uprights which had supported it still remaining.Behind the rails of the balcony I saw there were some loose boards,whose raw edges looked white. I would have given a good deal to havebeen able to see the notice-board intact, as it would, perhaps, havegiven some clue to the ownership of the house. I remembered myexperience of the investigation and purchase of Carfax, and I could notbut feel that if I could find the former owner there might be some meansdiscovered of gaining access to the house.There was at present nothing to be learned from the Piccadilly side, andnothing could be done; so I went round to the back to see if anythingcould be gathered from this quarter. The mews were active, thePiccadilly houses being mostly in occupation. I asked one or two of thegrooms and helpers whom I saw around if they could tell me anythingabout the empty house. One of them said that he heard it had lately beentaken, but he couldn’t say from whom. He told me, however, that up tovery lately there had been a notice-board of “For Sale” up, and thatperhaps Mitchell, Sons, & Candy, the house agents, could tell mesomething, as he thought he remembered seeing the name of that firm onthe board. I did not wish to seem too eager, or to let my informant knowor guess too much, so, thanking him in the usual manner, I strolledaway. It was now growing dusk, and the autumn night was closing in, so Idid not lose any time. Having learned the address of Mitchell, Sons, &Candy from a directory at the Berkeley, I was soon at their office inSackville Street.The gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in manner, butuncommunicative in equal proportion. Having once told me that thePiccadilly house--which throughout our interview he called a“mansion”--was sold, he considered my business as concluded. When Iasked who had purchased it, he opened his eyes a thought wider, andpaused a few seconds before replying:--“It is sold, sir.”“Pardon me,” I said, with equal politeness, “but I have a special reasonfor wishing to know who purchased it.”Again he paused longer, and raised his eyebrows still more. “It is sold,sir,” was again his laconic reply.“Surely,” I said, “you do not mind letting me know so much.”“But I do mind,” he answered. “The affairs of their clients areabsolutely safe in the hands of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy.” This wasmanifestly a prig of the first water, and there was no use arguing withhim. I thought I had best meet him on his own ground, so I said:--“Your clients, sir, are happy in having so resolute a guardian of theirconfidence. I am myself a professional man.” Here I handed him my card.“In this instance I am not prompted by curiosity; I act on the part ofLord Godalming, who wishes to know something of the property which was,he understood, lately for sale.” These words put a different complexionon affairs. He said:--“I would like to oblige you if I could, Mr. Harker, and especially wouldI like to oblige his lordship. We once carried out a small matter ofrenting some chambers for him when he was the Honourable ArthurHolmwood. If you will let me have his lordship’s address I will consultthe House on the subject, and will, in any case, communicate with hislordship by to-night’s post. It will be a pleasure if we can so fardeviate from our rules as to give the required information to hislordship.”I wanted to secure a friend, and not to make an enemy, so I thanked him,gave the address at Dr. Seward’s and came away. It was now dark, and Iwas tired and hungry. I got a cup of tea at the Aërated Bread Companyand came down to Purfleet by the next train.I found all the others at home. Mina was looking tired and pale, but shemade a gallant effort to be bright and cheerful, it wrung my heart tothink that I had had to keep anything from her and so caused herinquietude. Thank God, this will be the last night of her looking on atour conferences, and feeling the sting of our not showing ourconfidence. It took all my courage to hold to the wise resolution ofkeeping her out of our grim task. She seems somehow more reconciled; orelse the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her, for whenany accidental allusion is made she actually shudders. I am glad wemade our resolution in time, as with such a feeling as this, our growingknowledge would be torture to her.I could not tell the others of the day’s discovery till we were alone;so after dinner--followed by a little music to save appearances evenamongst ourselves--I took Mina to her room and left her to go to bed.The dear girl was more affectionate with me than ever, and clung to meas though she would detain me; but there was much to be talked of and Icame away. Thank God, the ceasing of telling things has made nodifference between us.When I came down again I found the others all gathered round the fire inthe study. In the train I had written my diary so far, and simply readit off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of my owninformation; when I had finished Van Helsing said:--“This has been a great day’s work, friend Jonathan. Doubtless we are onthe track of the missing boxes. If we find them all in that house, thenour work is near the end. But if there be some missing, we must searchuntil we find them. Then shall we make our final _coup_, and hunt thewretch to his real death.” We all sat silent awhile and all at once Mr.Morris spoke:--“Say! how are we going to get into that house?”“We got into the other,” answered Lord Godalming quickly.“But, Art, this is different. We broke house at Carfax, but we had nightand a walled park to protect us. It will be a mighty different thing tocommit burglary in Piccadilly, either by day or night. I confess I don’tsee how we are going to get in unless that agency duck can find us a keyof some sort; perhaps we shall know when you get his letter in themorning.” Lord Godalming’s brows contracted, and he stood up and walkedabout the room. By-and-by he stopped and said, turning from one toanother of us:--“Quincey’s head is level. This burglary business is getting serious; wegot off once all right; but we have now a rare job on hand--unless wecan find the Count’s key basket.”As nothing could well be done before morning, and as it would be atleast advisable to wait till Lord Godalming should hear from Mitchell’s,we decided not to take any active step before breakfast time. For a goodwhile we sat and smoked, discussing the matter in its various lights andbearings; I took the opportunity of bringing this diary right up to themoment. I am very sleepy and shall go to bed....Just a line. Mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is regular. Herforehead is puckered up into little wrinkles, as though she thinks evenin her sleep. She is still too pale, but does not look so haggard as shedid this morning. To-morrow will, I hope, mend all this; she will beherself at home in Exeter. Oh, but I am sleepy!_Dr. Seward’s Diary.__1 October._--I am puzzled afresh about Renfield. His moods change sorapidly that I find it difficult to keep touch of them, and as theyalways mean something more than his own well-being, they form a morethan interesting study. This morning, when I went to see him after hisrepulse of Van Helsing, his manner was that of a man commanding destiny.He was, in fact, commanding destiny--subjectively. He did not reallycare for any of the things of mere earth; he was in the clouds andlooked down on all the weaknesses and wants of us poor mortals. Ithought I would improve the occasion and learn something, so I askedhim:--“What about the flies these times?” He smiled on me in quite a superiorsort of way--such a smile as would have become the face of Malvolio--ashe answered me:--“The fly, my dear sir, has one striking feature; its wings are typicalof the aërial powers of the psychic faculties. The ancients did wellwhen they typified the soul as a butterfly!”I thought I would push his analogy to its utmost logically, so I saidquickly:--“Oh, it is a soul you are after now, is it?” His madness foiled hisreason, and a puzzled look spread over his face as, shaking his headwith a decision which I had but seldom seen in him, he said:--“Oh, no, oh no! I want no souls. Life is all I want.” Here he brightenedup; “I am pretty indifferent about it at present. Life is all right; Ihave all I want. You must get a new patient, doctor, if you wish tostudy zoöphagy!”This puzzled me a little, so I drew him on:--“Then you command life; you are a god, I suppose?” He smiled with anineffably benign superiority.“Oh no! Far be it from me to arrogate to myself the attributes of theDeity. I am not even concerned in His especially spiritual doings. If Imay state my intellectual position I am, so far as concerns thingspurely terrestrial, somewhat in the position which Enoch occupiedspiritually!” This was a poser to me. I could not at the moment recallEnoch’s appositeness; so I had to ask a simple question, though I feltthat by so doing I was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic:--“And why with Enoch?”“Because he walked with God.” I could not see the analogy, but did notlike to admit it; so I harked back to what he had denied:--“So you don’t care about life and you don’t want souls. Why not?” I putmy question quickly and somewhat sternly, on purpose to disconcert him.The effort succeeded; for an instant he unconsciously relapsed into hisold servile manner, bent low before me, and actually fawned upon me ashe replied:--“I don’t want any souls, indeed, indeed! I don’t. I couldn’t use them ifI had them; they would be no manner of use to me. I couldn’t eat themor----” He suddenly stopped and the old cunning look spread over hisface, like a wind-sweep on the surface of the water. “And doctor, as tolife, what is it after all? When you’ve got all you require, and youknow that you will never want, that is all. I have friends--goodfriends--like you, Dr. Seward”; this was said with a leer ofinexpressible cunning. “I know that I shall never lack the means oflife!”I think that through the cloudiness of his insanity he saw someantagonism in me, for he at once fell back on the last refuge of such ashe--a dogged silence. After a short time I saw that for the present itwas useless to speak to him. He was sulky, and so I came away.Later in the day he sent for me. Ordinarily I would not have comewithout special reason, but just at present I am so interested in himthat I would gladly make an effort. Besides, I am glad to have anythingto help to pass the time. Harker is out, following up clues; and so areLord Godalming and Quincey. Van Helsing sits in my study poring over therecord prepared by the Harkers; he seems to think that by accurateknowledge of all details he will light upon some clue. He does not wishto be disturbed in the work, without cause. I would have taken him withme to see the patient, only I thought that after his last repulse hemight not care to go again. There was also another reason: Renfieldmight not speak so freely before a third person as when he and I werealone.I found him sitting out in the middle of the floor on his stool, a posewhich is generally indicative of some mental energy on his part. When Icame in, he said at once, as though the question had been waiting on hislips:--“What about souls?” It was evident then that my surmise had beencorrect. Unconscious cerebration was doing its work, even with thelunatic. I determined to have the matter out. “What about themyourself?” I asked. He did not reply for a moment but looked all roundhim, and up and down, as though he expected to find some inspiration foran answer.“I don’t want any souls!” he said in a feeble, apologetic way. Thematter seemed preying on his mind, and so I determined to use it--to “becruel only to be kind.” So I said:--“You like life, and you want life?”“Oh yes! but that is all right; you needn’t worry about that!”“But,” I asked, “how are we to get the life without getting the soulalso?” This seemed to puzzle him, so I followed it up:--“A nice time you’ll have some time when you’re flying out there, withthe souls of thousands of flies and spiders and birds and cats buzzingand twittering and miauing all round you. You’ve got their lives, youknow, and you must put up with their souls!” Something seemed to affecthis imagination, for he put his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes,screwing them up tightly just as a small boy does when his face is beingsoaped. There was something pathetic in it that touched me; it also gaveme a lesson, for it seemed that before me was a child--only a child,though the features were worn, and the stubble on the jaws was white. Itwas evident that he was undergoing some process of mental disturbance,and, knowing how his past moods had interpreted things seemingly foreignto himself, I thought I would enter into his mind as well as I could andgo with him. The first step was to restore confidence, so I asked him,speaking pretty loud so that he would hear me through his closed ears:--“Would you like some sugar to get your flies round again?” He seemed towake up all at once, and shook his head. With a laugh he replied:--“Not much! flies are poor things, after all!” After a pause he added,“But I don’t want their souls buzzing round me, all the same.”“Or spiders?” I went on.“Blow spiders! What’s the use of spiders? There isn’t anything in themto eat or”--he stopped suddenly, as though reminded of a forbiddentopic.“So, so!” I thought to myself, “this is the second time he has suddenlystopped at the word ‘drink’; what does it mean?” Renfield seemed himselfaware of having made a lapse, for he hurried on, as though to distractmy attention from it:--“I don’t take any stock at all in such matters. ‘Rats and mice and suchsmall deer,’ as Shakespeare has it, ‘chicken-feed of the larder’ theymight be called. I’m past all that sort of nonsense. You might as wellask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chop-sticks, as to try tointerest me about the lesser carnivora, when I know of what is beforeme.”“I see,” I said. “You want big things that you can make your teeth meetin? How would you like to breakfast on elephant?”“What ridiculous nonsense you are talking!” He was getting too wideawake, so I thought I would press him hard. “I wonder,” I saidreflectively, “what an elephant’s soul is like!”The effect I desired was obtained, for he at once fell from hishigh-horse and became a child again.“I don’t want an elephant’s soul, or any soul at all!” he said. For afew moments he sat despondently. Suddenly he jumped to his feet, withhis eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement. “Tohell with you and your souls!” he shouted. “Why do you plague me aboutsouls? Haven’t I got enough to worry, and pain, and distract me already,without thinking of souls!” He looked so hostile that I thought he wasin for another homicidal fit, so I blew my whistle. The instant,however, that I did so he became calm, and said apologetically:--“Forgive me, Doctor; I forgot myself. You do not need any help. I am soworried in my mind that I am apt to be irritable. If you only knew theproblem I have to face, and that I am working out, you would pity, andtolerate, and pardon me. Pray do not put me in a strait-waistcoat. Iwant to think and I cannot think freely when my body is confined. I amsure you will understand!” He had evidently self-control; so when theattendants came I told them not to mind, and they withdrew. Renfieldwatched them go; when the door was closed he said, with considerabledignity and sweetness:--“Dr. Seward, you have been very considerate towards me. Believe me thatI am very, very grateful to you!” I thought it well to leave him in thismood, and so I came away. There is certainly something to ponder over inthis man’s state. Several points seem to make what the Americaninterviewer calls “a story,” if one could only get them in proper order.Here they are:--Will not mention “drinking.”Fears the thought of being burdened with the “soul” of anything.Has no dread of wanting “life” in the future.Despises the meaner forms of life altogether, though he dreads beinghaunted by their souls.Logically all these things point one way! he has assurance of some kindthat he will acquire some higher life. He dreads the consequence--theburden of a soul. Then it is a human life he looks to!And the assurance--?Merciful God! the Count has been to him, and there is some new scheme ofterror afoot!*       *       *       *       *_Later._--I went after my round to Van Helsing and told him mysuspicion. He grew very grave; and, after thinking the matter over for awhile asked me to take him to Renfield. I did so. As we came to the doorwe heard the lunatic within singing gaily, as he used to do in the timewhich now seems so long ago. When we entered we saw with amazement thathe had spread out his sugar as of old; the flies, lethargic with theautumn, were beginning to buzz into the room. We tried to make him talkof the subject of our previous conversation, but he would not attend. Hewent on with his singing, just as though we had not been present. He hadgot a scrap of paper and was folding it into a note-book. We had to comeaway as ignorant as we went in.His is a curious case indeed; we must watch him to-night._Letter, Mitchell, Sons and Candy to Lord Godalming.__“1 October._“My Lord,“We are at all times only too happy to meet your wishes. We beg, withregard to the desire of your Lordship, expressed by Mr. Harker on yourbehalf, to supply the following information concerning the sale andpurchase of No. 347, Piccadilly. The original vendors are the executorsof the late Mr. Archibald Winter-Suffield. The purchaser is a foreignnobleman, Count de Ville, who effected the purchase himself paying thepurchase money in notes ‘over the counter,’ if your Lordship will pardonus using so vulgar an expression. Beyond this we know nothing whateverof him.“We are, my Lord,“Your Lordship’s humble servants,“MITCHELL, SONS & CANDY.”_Dr. Seward’s Diary.__2 October._--I placed a man in the corridor last night, and told him tomake an accurate note of any sound he might hear from Renfield’s room,and gave him instructions that if there should be anything strange hewas to call me. After dinner, when we had all gathered round the firein the study--Mrs. Harker having gone to bed--we discussed the attemptsand discoveries of the day. Harker was the only one who had any result,and we are in great hopes that his clue may be an important one.Before going to bed I went round to the patient’s room and looked inthrough the observation trap. He was sleeping soundly, and his heartrose and fell with regular respiration.This morning the man on duty reported to me that a little after midnighthe was restless and kept saying his prayers somewhat loudly. I asked himif that was all; he replied that it was all he heard. There wassomething about his manner so suspicious that I asked him point blank ifhe had been asleep. He denied sleep, but admitted to having “dozed” fora while. It is too bad that men cannot be trusted unless they arewatched.To-day Harker is out following up his clue, and Art and Quincey arelooking after horses. Godalming thinks that it will be well to havehorses always in readiness, for when we get the information which weseek there will be no time to lose. We must sterilise all the importedearth between sunrise and sunset; we shall thus catch the Count at hisweakest, and without a refuge to fly to. Van Helsing is off to theBritish Museum looking up some authorities on ancient medicine. The oldphysicians took account of things which their followers do not accept,and the Professor is searching for witch and demon cures which may beuseful to us later.I sometimes think we must be all mad and that we shall wake to sanity instrait-waistcoats.*       *       *       *       *_Later._--We have met again. We seem at last to be on the track, and ourwork of to-morrow may be the beginning of the end. I wonder ifRenfield’s quiet has anything to do with this. His moods have sofollowed the doings of the Count, that the coming destruction of themonster may be carried to him in some subtle way. If we could only getsome hint as to what passed in his mind, between the time of my argumentwith him to-day and his resumption of fly-catching, it might afford us avaluable clue. He is now seemingly quiet for a spell.... Is he?---- Thatwild yell seemed to come from his room....*       *       *       *       *The attendant came bursting into my room and told me that Renfield hadsomehow met with some accident. He had heard him yell; and when he wentto him found him lying on his face on the floor, all covered with blood.I must go at once....CHAPTER XXIDR. SEWARD’S DIARY_3 October._--Let me put down with exactness all that happened, as wellas I can remember it, since last I made an entry. Not a detail that Ican recall must be forgotten; in all calmness I must proceed.When I came to Renfield’s room I found him lying on the floor on hisleft side in a glittering pool of blood. When I went to move him, itbecame at once apparent that he had received some terrible injuries;there seemed none of that unity of purpose between the parts of the bodywhich marks even lethargic sanity. As the face was exposed I could seethat it was horribly bruised, as though it had been beaten against thefloor--indeed it was from the face wounds that the pool of bloodoriginated. The attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to me aswe turned him over:--“I think, sir, his back is broken. See, both his right arm and leg andthe whole side of his face are paralysed.” How such a thing could havehappened puzzled the attendant beyond measure. He seemed quitebewildered, and his brows were gathered in as he said:--“I can’t understand the two things. He could mark his face like that bybeating his own head on the floor. I saw a young woman do it once at theEversfield Asylum before anyone could lay hands on her. And I suppose hemight have broke his neck by falling out of bed, if he got in an awkwardkink. But for the life of me I can’t imagine how the two thingsoccurred. If his back was broke, he couldn’t beat his head; and if hisface was like that before the fall out of bed, there would be marks ofit.” I said to him:--“Go to Dr. Van Helsing, and ask him to kindly come here at once. I wanthim without an instant’s delay.” The man ran off, and within a fewminutes the Professor, in his dressing gown and slippers, appeared. Whenhe saw Renfield on the ground, he looked keenly at him a moment, andthen turned to me. I think he recognised my thought in my eyes, for hesaid very quietly, manifestly for the ears of the attendant:--“Ah, a sad accident! He will need very careful watching, and muchattention. I shall stay with you myself; but I shall first dress myself.If you will remain I shall in a few minutes join you.”The patient was now breathing stertorously and it was easy to see thathe had suffered some terrible injury. Van Helsing returned withextraordinary celerity, bearing with him a surgical case. He hadevidently been thinking and had his mind made up; for, almost before helooked at the patient, he whispered to me:--“Send the attendant away. We must be alone with him when he becomesconscious, after the operation.” So I said:--“I think that will do now, Simmons. We have done all that we can atpresent. You had better go your round, and Dr. Van Helsing will operate.Let me know instantly if there be anything unusual anywhere.”The man withdrew, and we went into a strict examination of the patient.The wounds of the face was superficial; the real injury was a depressedfracture of the skull, extending right up through the motor area. TheProfessor thought a moment and said:--“We must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions, as faras can be; the rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature ofhis injury. The whole motor area seems affected. The suffusion of thebrain will increase quickly, so we must trephine at once or it may betoo late.” As he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door. Iwent over and opened it and found in the corridor without, Arthur andQuincey in pajamas and slippers: the former spoke:--“I heard your man call up Dr. Van Helsing and tell him of an accident.So I woke Quincey or rather called for him as he was not asleep. Thingsare moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of usthese times. I’ve been thinking that to-morrow night will not see thingsas they have been. We’ll have to look back--and forward a little morethan we have done. May we come in?” I nodded, and held the door opentill they had entered; then I closed it again. When Quincey saw theattitude and state of the patient, and noted the horrible pool on thefloor, he said softly:--“My God! what has happened to him? Poor, poor devil!” I told himbriefly, and added that we expected he would recover consciousness afterthe operation--for a short time, at all events. He went at once and satdown on the edge of the bed, with Godalming beside him; we all watchedin patience.“We shall wait,” said Van Helsing, “just long enough to fix the bestspot for trephining, so that we may most quickly and perfectly removethe blood clot; for it is evident that the hæmorrhage is increasing.”The minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness. I had ahorrible sinking in my heart, and from Van Helsing’s face I gatheredthat he felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come. I dreadedthe words that Renfield might speak. I was positively afraid to think;but the conviction of what was coming was on me, as I have read of menwho have heard the death-watch. The poor man’s breathing came inuncertain gasps. Each instant he seemed as though he would open his eyesand speak; but then would follow a prolonged stertorous breath, and hewould relapse into a more fixed insensibility. Inured as I was to sickbeds and death, this suspense grew, and grew upon me. I could almosthear the beating of my own heart; and the blood surging through mytemples sounded like blows from a hammer. The silence finally becameagonising. I looked at my companions, one after another, and saw fromtheir flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equaltorture. There was a nervous suspense over us all, as though overheadsome dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should least expectit.At last there came a time when it was evident that the patient wassinking fast; he might die at any moment. I looked up at the Professorand caught his eyes fixed on mine. His face was sternly set as hespoke:--“There is no time to lose. His words may be worth many lives; I havebeen thinking so, as I stood here. It may be there is a soul at stake!We shall operate just above the ear.”Without another word he made the operation. For a few moments thebreathing continued to be stertorous. Then there came a breath soprolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chest.Suddenly his eyes opened, and became fixed in a wild, helpless stare.This was continued for a few moments; then it softened into a gladsurprise, and from the lips came a sigh of relief. He movedconvulsively, and as he did so, said:--“I’ll be quiet, Doctor. Tell them to take off the strait-waistcoat. Ihave had a terrible dream, and it has left me so weak that I cannotmove. What’s wrong with my face? it feels all swollen, and it smartsdreadfully.” He tried to turn his head; but even with the effort hiseyes seemed to grow glassy again so I gently put it back. Then VanHelsing said in a quiet grave tone:--“Tell us your dream, Mr. Renfield.” As he heard the voice his facebrightened, through its mutilation, and he said:--“That is Dr. Van Helsing. How good it is of you to be here. Give me somewater, my lips are dry; and I shall try to tell you. I dreamed”--hestopped and seemed fainting, I called quietly to Quincey--“Thebrandy--it is in my study--quick!” He flew and returned with a glass,the decanter of brandy and a carafe of water. We moistened the parchedlips, and the patient quickly revived. It seemed, however, that his poorinjured brain had been working in the interval, for, when he was quiteconscious, he looked at me piercingly with an agonised confusion which Ishall never forget, and said:--“I must not deceive myself; it was no dream, but all a grim reality.”Then his eyes roved round the room; as they caught sight of the twofigures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed he went on:--“If I were not sure already, I would know from them.” For an instant hiseyes closed--not with pain or sleep but voluntarily, as though he werebringing all his faculties to bear; when he opened them he said,hurriedly, and with more energy than he had yet displayed:--“Quick, Doctor, quick. I am dying! I feel that I have but a few minutes;and then I must go back to death--or worse! Wet my lips with brandyagain. I have something that I must say before I die; or before my poorcrushed brain dies anyhow. Thank you! It was that night after you leftme, when I implored you to let me go away. I couldn’t speak then, for Ifelt my tongue was tied; but I was as sane then, except in that way, asI am now. I was in an agony of despair for a long time after you leftme; it seemed hours. Then there came a sudden peace to me. My brainseemed to become cool again, and I realised where I was. I heard thedogs bark behind our house, but not where He was!” As he spoke, VanHelsing’s eyes never blinked, but his hand came out and met mine andgripped it hard. He did not, however, betray himself; he nodded slightlyand said: “Go on,” in a low voice. Renfield proceeded:--“He came up to the window in the mist, as I had seen him often before;but he was solid then--not a ghost, and his eyes were fierce like aman’s when angry. He was laughing with his red mouth; the sharp whiteteeth glinted in the moonlight when he turned to look back over the beltof trees, to where the dogs were barking. I wouldn’t ask him to come inat first, though I knew he wanted to--just as he had wanted all along.Then he began promising me things--not in words but by doing them.” Hewas interrupted by a word from the Professor:--“How?”“By making them happen; just as he used to send in the flies when thesun was shining. Great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on theirwings; and big moths, in the night, with skull and cross-bones on theirbacks.” Van Helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me unconsciously:--“The _Acherontia Aitetropos of the Sphinges_--what you call the‘Death’s-head Moth’?” The patient went on without stopping.“Then he began to whisper: ‘Rats, rats, rats! Hundreds, thousands,millions of them, and every one a life; and dogs to eat them, and catstoo. All lives! all red blood, with years of life in it; and not merelybuzzing flies!’ I laughed at him, for I wanted to see what he could do.Then the dogs howled, away beyond the dark trees in His house. Hebeckoned me to the window. I got up and looked out, and He raised hishands, and seemed to call out without using any words. A dark massspread over the grass, coming on like the shape of a flame of fire; andthen He moved the mist to the right and left, and I could see that therewere thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red--like His, onlysmaller. He held up his hand, and they all stopped; and I thought heseemed to be saying: ‘All these lives will I give you, ay, and many moreand greater, through countless ages, if you will fall down and worshipme!’ And then a red cloud, like the colour of blood, seemed to closeover my eyes; and before I knew what I was doing, I found myself openingthe sash and saying to Him: ‘Come in, Lord and Master!’ The rats wereall gone, but He slid into the room through the sash, though it was onlyopen an inch wide--just as the Moon herself has often come in throughthe tiniest crack and has stood before me in all her size andsplendour.”His voice was weaker, so I moistened his lips with the brandy again, andhe continued; but it seemed as though his memory had gone on working inthe interval for his story was further advanced. I was about to call himback to the point, but Van Helsing whispered to me: “Let him go on. Donot interrupt him; he cannot go back, and maybe could not proceed at allif once he lost the thread of his thought.” He proceeded:--“All day I waited to hear from him, but he did not send me anything, noteven a blow-fly, and when the moon got up I was pretty angry with him.When he slid in through the window, though it was shut, and did not evenknock, I got mad with him. He sneered at me, and his white face lookedout of the mist with his red eyes gleaming, and he went on as though heowned the whole place, and I was no one. He didn’t even smell the sameas he went by me. I couldn’t hold him. I thought that, somehow, Mrs.Harker had come into the room.”The two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over, standing behindhim so that he could not see them, but where they could hear better.They were both silent, but the Professor started and quivered; his face,however, grew grimmer and sterner still. Renfield went on withoutnoticing:--“When Mrs. Harker came in to see me this afternoon she wasn’t the same;it was like tea after the teapot had been watered.” Here we all moved,but no one said a word; he went on:--“I didn’t know that she was here till she spoke; and she didn’t look thesame. I don’t care for the pale people; I like them with lots of bloodin them, and hers had all seemed to have run out. I didn’t think of itat the time; but when she went away I began to think, and it made me madto know that He had been taking the life out of her.” I could feel thatthe rest quivered, as I did, but we remained otherwise still. “So whenHe came to-night I was ready for Him. I saw the mist stealing in, and Igrabbed it tight. I had heard that madmen have unnatural strength; andas I knew I was a madman--at times anyhow--I resolved to use my power.Ay, and He felt it too, for He had to come out of the mist to strugglewith me. I held tight; and I thought I was going to win, for I didn’tmean Him to take any more of her life, till I saw His eyes. They burnedinto me, and my strength became like water. He slipped through it, andwhen I tried to cling to Him, He raised me up and flung me down. Therewas a red cloud before me, and a noise like thunder, and the mist seemedto steal away under the door.” His voice was becoming fainter and hisbreath more stertorous. Van Helsing stood up instinctively.“We know the worst now,” he said. “He is here, and we know his purpose.It may not be too late. Let us be armed--the same as we were the othernight, but lose no time; there is not an instant to spare.” There was noneed to put our fear, nay our conviction, into words--we shared them incommon. We all hurried and took from our rooms the same things that wehad when we entered the Count’s house. The Professor had his ready, andas we met in the corridor he pointed to them significantly as he said:--“They never leave me; and they shall not till this unhappy business isover. Be wise also, my friends. It is no common enemy that we deal with.Alas! alas! that that dear Madam Mina should suffer!” He stopped; hisvoice was breaking, and I do not know if rage or terror predominated inmy own heart.Outside the Harkers’ door we paused. Art and Quincey held back, and thelatter said:--“Should we disturb her?”“We must,” said Van Helsing grimly. “If the door be locked, I shallbreak it in.”“May it not frighten her terribly? It is unusual to break into a lady’sroom!”Van Helsing said solemnly, “You are always right; but this is life anddeath. All chambers are alike to the doctor; and even were they not theyare all as one to me to-night. Friend John, when I turn the handle, ifthe door does not open, do you put your shoulder down and shove; and youtoo, my friends. Now!”He turned the handle as he spoke, but the door did not yield. We threwourselves against it; with a crash it burst open, and we almost fellheadlong into the room. The Professor did actually fall, and I sawacross him as he gathered himself up from hands and knees. What I sawappalled me. I felt my hair rise like bristles on the back of my neck,and my heart seemed to stand still.The moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the roomwas light enough to see. On the bed beside the window lay JonathanHarker, his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor.Kneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was the white-cladfigure of his wife. By her side stood a tall, thin man, clad in black.His face was turned from us, but the instant we saw we all recognisedthe Count--in every way, even to the scar on his forehead. With his lefthand he held both Mrs. Harker’s hands, keeping them away with her armsat full tension; his right hand gripped her by the back of the neck,forcing her face down on his bosom. Her white nightdress was smearedwith blood, and a thin stream trickled down the man’s bare breast whichwas shown by his torn-open dress. The attitude of the two had a terribleresemblance to a child forcing a kitten’s nose into a saucer of milk tocompel it to drink. As we burst into the room, the Count turned hisface, and the hellish look that I had heard described seemed to leapinto it. His eyes flamed red with devilish passion; the great nostrilsof the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge; and thewhite sharp teeth, behind the full lips of the blood-dripping mouth,champed together like those of a wild beast. With a wrench, which threwhis victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height, he turnedand sprang at us. But by this time the Professor had gained his feet,and was holding towards him the envelope which contained the SacredWafer. The Count suddenly stopped, just as poor Lucy had done outsidethe tomb, and cowered back. Further and further back he cowered, as we,lifting our crucifixes, advanced. The moonlight suddenly failed, as agreat black cloud sailed across the sky; and when the gaslight sprang upunder Quincey’s match, we saw nothing but a faint vapour. This, as welooked, trailed under the door, which with the recoil from its burstingopen, had swung back to its old position. Van Helsing, Art, and I movedforward to Mrs. Harker, who by this time had drawn her breath and withit had given a scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so despairing that itseems to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day. For afew seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray. Her face wasghastly, with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smearedher lips and cheeks and chin; from her throat trickled a thin stream ofblood; her eyes were mad with terror. Then she put before her face herpoor crushed hands, which bore on their whiteness the red mark of theCount’s terrible grip, and from behind them came a low desolate wailwhich made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of anendless grief. Van Helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gentlyover her body, whilst Art, after looking at her face for an instantdespairingly, ran out of the room. Van Helsing whispered to me:--“Jonathan is in a stupor such as we know the Vampire can produce. We cando nothing with poor Madam Mina for a few moments till she recoversherself; I must wake him!” He dipped the end of a towel in cold waterand with it began to flick him on the face, his wife all the whileholding her face between her hands and sobbing in a way that washeart-breaking to hear. I raised the blind, and looked out of thewindow. There was much moonshine; and as I looked I could see QuinceyMorris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of a greatyew-tree. It puzzled me to think why he was doing this; but at theinstant I heard Harker’s quick exclamation as he woke to partialconsciousness, and turned to the bed. On his face, as there might wellbe, was a look of wild amazement. He seemed dazed for a few seconds, andthen full consciousness seemed to burst upon him all at once, and hestarted up. His wife was aroused by the quick movement, and turned tohim with her arms stretched out, as though to embrace him; instantly,however, she drew them in again, and putting her elbows together, heldher hands before her face, and shuddered till the bed beneath her shook.“In God’s name what does this mean?” Harker cried out. “Dr. Seward, Dr.Van Helsing, what is it? What has happened? What is wrong? Mina, dear,what is it? What does that blood mean? My God, my God! has it come tothis!” and, raising himself to his knees, he beat his hands wildlytogether. “Good God help us! help her! oh, help her!” With a quickmovement he jumped from bed, and began to pull on his clothes,--all theman in him awake at the need for instant exertion. “What has happened?Tell me all about it!” he cried without pausing. “Dr. Van Helsing, youlove Mina, I know. Oh, do something to save her. It cannot have gone toofar yet. Guard her while I look for _him_!” His wife, through her terrorand horror and distress, saw some sure danger to him: instantlyforgetting her own grief, she seized hold of him and cried out:--“No! no! Jonathan, you must not leave me. I have suffered enoughto-night, God knows, without the dread of his harming you. You must staywith me. Stay with these friends who will watch over you!” Herexpression became frantic as she spoke; and, he yielding to her, shepulled him down sitting on the bed side, and clung to him fiercely.Van Helsing and I tried to calm them both. The Professor held up hislittle golden crucifix, and said with wonderful calmness:--“Do not fear, my dear. We are here; and whilst this is close to you nofoul thing can approach. You are safe for to-night; and we must be calmand take counsel together.” She shuddered and was silent, holding downher head on her husband’s breast. When she raised it, his whitenight-robe was stained with blood where her lips had touched, and wherethe thin open wound in her neck had sent forth drops. The instant shesaw it she drew back, with a low wail, and whispered, amidst chokingsobs:--“Unclean, unclean! I must touch him or kiss him no more. Oh, that itshould be that it is I who am now his worst enemy, and whom he may havemost cause to fear.” To this he spoke out resolutely:--“Nonsense, Mina. It is a shame to me to hear such a word. I would nothear it of you; and I shall not hear it from you. May God judge me by mydeserts, and punish me with more bitter suffering than even this hour,if by any act or will of mine anything ever come between us!” He put outhis arms and folded her to his breast; and for a while she lay theresobbing. He looked at us over her bowed head, with eyes that blinkeddamply above his quivering nostrils; his mouth was set as steel. After awhile her sobs became less frequent and more faint, and then he said tome, speaking with a studied calmness which I felt tried his nervouspower to the utmost:--“And now, Dr. Seward, tell me all about it. Too well I know the broadfact; tell me all that has been.” I told him exactly what had happened,and he listened with seeming impassiveness; but his nostrils twitchedand his eyes blazed as I told how the ruthless hands of the Count hadheld his wife in that terrible and horrid position, with her mouth tothe open wound in his breast. It interested me, even at that moment, tosee, that, whilst the face of white set passion worked convulsively overthe bowed head, the hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffledhair. Just as I had finished, Quincey and Godalming knocked at the door.They entered in obedience to our summons. Van Helsing looked at mequestioningly. I understood him to mean if we were to take advantage oftheir coming to divert if possible the thoughts of the unhappy husbandand wife from each other and from themselves; so on nodding acquiescenceto him he asked them what they had seen or done. To which Lord Godalminganswered:--“I could not see him anywhere in the passage, or in any of our rooms. Ilooked in the study but, though he had been there, he had gone. He had,however----” He stopped suddenly, looking at the poor drooping figure onthe bed. Van Helsing said gravely:--“Go on, friend Arthur. We want here no more concealments. Our hope nowis in knowing all. Tell freely!” So Art went on:--“He had been there, and though it could only have been for a fewseconds, he made rare hay of the place. All the manuscript had beenburned, and the blue flames were flickering amongst the white ashes; thecylinders of your phonograph too were thrown on the fire, and the waxhad helped the flames.” Here I interrupted. “Thank God there is theother copy in the safe!” His face lit for a moment, but fell again as hewent on: “I ran downstairs then, but could see no sign of him. I lookedinto Renfield’s room; but there was no trace there except----!” Again hepaused. “Go on,” said Harker hoarsely; so he bowed his head andmoistening his lips with his tongue, added: “except that the poor fellowis dead.” Mrs. Harker raised her head, looking from one to the other ofus she said solemnly:--“God’s will be done!” I could not but feel that Art was keeping backsomething; but, as I took it that it was with a purpose, I said nothing.Van Helsing turned to Morris and asked:--“And you, friend Quincey, have you any to tell?”“A little,” he answered. “It may be much eventually, but at present Ican’t say. I thought it well to know if possible where the Count wouldgo when he left the house. I did not see him; but I saw a bat rise fromRenfield’s window, and flap westward. I expected to see him in someshape go back to Carfax; but he evidently sought some other lair. Hewill not be back to-night; for the sky is reddening in the east, and thedawn is close. We must work to-morrow!”He said the latter words through his shut teeth. For a space of perhapsa couple of minutes there was silence, and I could fancy that I couldhear the sound of our hearts beating; then Van Helsing said, placing hishand very tenderly on Mrs. Harker’s head:--“And now, Madam Mina--poor, dear, dear Madam Mina--tell us exactly whathappened. God knows that I do not want that you be pained; but it isneed that we know all. For now more than ever has all work to be donequick and sharp, and in deadly earnest. The day is close to us that mustend all, if it may be so; and now is the chance that we may live andlearn.”The poor, dear lady shivered, and I could see the tension of her nervesas she clasped her husband closer to her and bent her head lower andlower still on his breast. Then she raised her head proudly, and heldout one hand to Van Helsing who took it in his, and, after stooping andkissing it reverently, held it fast. The other hand was locked in thatof her husband, who held his other arm thrown round her protectingly.After a pause in which she was evidently ordering her thoughts, shebegan:--“I took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me, but for along time it did not act. I seemed to become more wakeful, and myriadsof horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind--all of themconnected with death, and vampires; with blood, and pain, and trouble.”Her husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and saidlovingly: “Do not fret, dear. You must be brave and strong, and help methrough the horrible task. If you only knew what an effort it is to meto tell of this fearful thing at all, you would understand how much Ineed your help. Well, I saw I must try to help the medicine to its workwith my will, if it was to do me any good, so I resolutely set myself tosleep. Sure enough sleep must soon have come to me, for I remember nomore. Jonathan coming in had not waked me, for he lay by my side whennext I remember. There was in the room the same thin white mist that Ihad before noticed. But I forget now if you know of this; you will findit in my diary which I shall show you later. I felt the same vagueterror which had come to me before and the same sense of some presence.I turned to wake Jonathan, but found that he slept so soundly that itseemed as if it was he who had taken the sleeping draught, and not I. Itried, but I could not wake him. This caused me a great fear, and Ilooked around terrified. Then indeed, my heart sank within me: besidethe bed, as if he had stepped out of the mist--or rather as if the misthad turned into his figure, for it had entirely disappeared--stood atall, thin man, all in black. I knew him at once from the description ofthe others. The waxen face; the high aquiline nose, on which the lightfell in a thin white line; the parted red lips, with the sharp whiteteeth showing between; and the red eyes that I had seemed to see in thesunset on the windows of St. Mary’s Church at Whitby. I knew, too, thered scar on his forehead where Jonathan had struck him. For an instantmy heart stood still, and I would have screamed out, only that I wasparalysed. In the pause he spoke in a sort of keen, cutting whisper,pointing as he spoke to Jonathan:--“‘Silence! If you make a sound I shall take him and dash his brains outbefore your very eyes.’ I was appalled and was too bewildered to do orsay anything. With a mocking smile, he placed one hand upon my shoulderand, holding me tight, bared my throat with the other, saying as he didso, ‘First, a little refreshment to reward my exertions. You may as wellbe quiet; it is not the first time, or the second, that your veins haveappeased my thirst!’ I was bewildered, and, strangely enough, I did notwant to hinder him. I suppose it is a part of the horrible curse thatsuch is, when his touch is on his victim. And oh, my God, my God, pityme! He placed his reeking lips upon my throat!” Her husband groanedagain. She clasped his hand harder, and looked at him pityingly, as ifhe were the injured one, and went on:--“I felt my strength fading away, and I was in a half swoon. How longthis horrible thing lasted I know not; but it seemed that a long timemust have passed before he took his foul, awful, sneering mouth away. Isaw it drip with the fresh blood!” The remembrance seemed for a while tooverpower her, and she drooped and would have sunk down but for herhusband’s sustaining arm. With a great effort she recovered herself andwent on:--“Then he spoke to me mockingly, ‘And so you, like the others, would playyour brains against mine. You would help these men to hunt me andfrustrate me in my designs! You know now, and they know in part already,and will know in full before long, what it is to cross my path. Theyshould have kept their energies for use closer to home. Whilst theyplayed wits against me--against me who commanded nations, and intriguedfor them, and fought for them, hundreds of years before they wereborn--I was countermining them. And you, their best beloved one, are nowto me, flesh of my flesh; blood of my blood; kin of my kin; my bountifulwine-press for a while; and shall be later on my companion and myhelper. You shall be avenged in turn; for not one of them but shallminister to your needs. But as yet you are to be punished for what youhave done. You have aided in thwarting me; now you shall come to mycall. When my brain says “Come!” to you, you shall cross land or sea todo my bidding; and to that end this!’ With that he pulled open hisshirt, and with his long sharp nails opened a vein in his breast. Whenthe blood began to spurt out, he took my hands in one of his, holdingthem tight, and with the other seized my neck and pressed my mouth tothe wound, so that I must either suffocate or swallow some of the---- Ohmy God! my God! what have I done? What have I done to deserve such afate, I who have tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all mydays. God pity me! Look down on a poor soul in worse than mortal peril;and in mercy pity those to whom she is dear!” Then she began to rub herlips as though to cleanse them from pollution.As she was telling her terrible story, the eastern sky began to quicken,and everything became more and more clear. Harker was still and quiet;but over his face, as the awful narrative went on, came a grey lookwhich deepened and deepened in the morning light, till when the firstred streak of the coming dawn shot up, the flesh stood darkly outagainst the whitening hair.We have arranged that one of us is to stay within call of the unhappypair till we can meet together and arrange about taking action.Of this I am sure: the sun rises to-day on no more miserable house inall the great round of its daily course.CHAPTER XXIIJONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL_3 October._--As I must do something or go mad, I write this diary. Itis now six o’clock, and we are to meet in the study in half an hour andtake something to eat; for Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward are agreedthat if we do not eat we cannot work our best. Our best will be, Godknows, required to-day. I must keep writing at every chance, for I darenot stop to think. All, big and little, must go down; perhaps at the endthe little things may teach us most. The teaching, big or little, couldnot have landed Mina or me anywhere worse than we are to-day. However,we must trust and hope. Poor Mina told me just now, with the tearsrunning down her dear cheeks, that it is in trouble and trial that ourfaith is tested--that we must keep on trusting; and that God will aid usup to the end. The end! oh my God! what end?... To work! To work!When Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward had come back from seeing poorRenfield, we went gravely into what was to be done. First, Dr. Sewardtold us that when he and Dr. Van Helsing had gone down to the room belowthey had found Renfield lying on the floor, all in a heap. His face wasall bruised and crushed in, and the bones of the neck were broken.Dr. Seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if he hadheard anything. He said that he had been sitting down--he confessed tohalf dozing--when he heard loud voices in the room, and then Renfieldhad called out loudly several times, “God! God! God!” after that therewas a sound of falling, and when he entered the room he found him lyingon the floor, face down, just as the doctors had seen him. Van Helsingasked if he had heard “voices” or “a voice,” and he said he could notsay; that at first it had seemed to him as if there were two, but asthere was no one in the room it could have been only one. He could swearto it, if required, that the word “God” was spoken by the patient. Dr.Seward said to us, when we were alone, that he did not wish to go intothe matter; the question of an inquest had to be considered, and itwould never do to put forward the truth, as no one would believe it. Asit was, he thought that on the attendant’s evidence he could give acertificate of death by misadventure in falling from bed. In case thecoroner should demand it, there would be a formal inquest, necessarilyto the same result.When the question began to be discussed as to what should be our nextstep, the very first thing we decided was that Mina should be in fullconfidence; that nothing of any sort--no matter how painful--should bekept from her. She herself agreed as to its wisdom, and it was pitifulto see her so brave and yet so sorrowful, and in such a depth ofdespair. “There must be no concealment,” she said, “Alas! we have hadtoo much already. And besides there is nothing in all the world that cangive me more pain than I have already endured--than I suffer now!Whatever may happen, it must be of new hope or of new courage to me!”Van Helsing was looking at her fixedly as she spoke, and said, suddenlybut quietly:--“But dear Madam Mina, are you not afraid; not for yourself, but forothers from yourself, after what has happened?” Her face grew set in itslines, but her eyes shone with the devotion of a martyr as sheanswered:--“Ah no! for my mind is made up!”“To what?” he asked gently, whilst we were all very still; for each inour own way we had a sort of vague idea of what she meant. Her answercame with direct simplicity, as though she were simply stating a fact:--“Because if I find in myself--and I shall watch keenly for it--a sign ofharm to any that I love, I shall die!”“You would not kill yourself?” he asked, hoarsely.“I would; if there were no friend who loved me, who would save me such apain, and so desperate an effort!” She looked at him meaningly as shespoke. He was sitting down; but now he rose and came close to her andput his hand on her head as he said solemnly:“My child, there is such an one if it were for your good. For myself Icould hold it in my account with God to find such an euthanasia for you,even at this moment if it were best. Nay, were it safe! But mychild----” For a moment he seemed choked, and a great sob rose in histhroat; he gulped it down and went on:--“There are here some who would stand between you and death. You must notdie. You must not die by any hand; but least of all by your own. Untilthe other, who has fouled your sweet life, is true dead you must notdie; for if he is still with the quick Un-Dead, your death would makeyou even as he is. No, you must live! You must struggle and strive tolive, though death would seem a boon unspeakable. You must fight Deathhimself, though he come to you in pain or in joy; by the day, or thenight; in safety or in peril! On your living soul I charge you that youdo not die--nay, nor think of death--till this great evil be past.” Thepoor dear grew white as death, and shock and shivered, as I have seen aquicksand shake and shiver at the incoming of the tide. We were allsilent; we could do nothing. At length she grew more calm and turning tohim said, sweetly, but oh! so sorrowfully, as she held out her hand:--“I promise you, my dear friend, that if God will let me live, I shallstrive to do so; till, if it may be in His good time, this horror mayhave passed away from me.” She was so good and brave that we all feltthat our hearts were strengthened to work and endure for her, and webegan to discuss what we were to do. I told her that she was to have allthe papers in the safe, and all the papers or diaries and phonographs wemight hereafter use; and was to keep the record as she had done before.She was pleased with the prospect of anything to do--if “pleased” couldbe used in connection with so grim an interest.As usual Van Helsing had thought ahead of everyone else, and wasprepared with an exact ordering of our work.“It is perhaps well,” he said, “that at our meeting after our visit toCarfax we decided not to do anything with the earth-boxes that laythere. Had we done so, the Count must have guessed our purpose, andwould doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate such aneffort with regard to the others; but now he does not know ourintentions. Nay, more, in all probability, he does not know that such apower exists to us as can sterilise his lairs, so that he cannot usethem as of old. We are now so much further advanced in our knowledge asto their disposition that, when we have examined the house inPiccadilly, we may track the very last of them. To-day, then, is ours;and in it rests our hope. The sun that rose on our sorrow this morningguards us in its course. Until it sets to-night, that monster mustretain whatever form he now has. He is confined within the limitationsof his earthly envelope. He cannot melt into thin air nor disappearthrough cracks or chinks or crannies. If he go through a doorway, hemust open the door like a mortal. And so we have this day to hunt outall his lairs and sterilise them. So we shall, if we have not yet catchhim and destroy him, drive him to bay in some place where the catchingand the destroying shall be, in time, sure.” Here I started up for Icould not contain myself at the thought that the minutes and seconds sopreciously laden with Mina’s life and happiness were flying from us,since whilst we talked action was impossible. But Van Helsing held uphis hand warningly. “Nay, friend Jonathan,” he said, “in this, thequickest way home is the longest way, so your proverb say. We shall allact and act with desperate quick, when the time has come. But think, inall probable the key of the situation is in that house in Piccadilly.The Count may have many houses which he has bought. Of them he will havedeeds of purchase, keys and other things. He will have paper that hewrite on; he will have his book of cheques. There are many belongingsthat he must have somewhere; why not in this place so central, so quiet,where he come and go by the front or the back at all hour, when in thevery vast of the traffic there is none to notice. We shall go there andsearch that house; and when we learn what it holds, then we do what ourfriend Arthur call, in his phrases of hunt ‘stop the earths’ and so werun down our old fox--so? is it not?”“Then let us come at once,” I cried, “we are wasting the precious,precious time!” The Professor did not move, but simply said:--“And how are we to get into that house in Piccadilly?”“Any way!” I cried. “We shall break in if need be.”“And your police; where will they be, and what will they say?”I was staggered; but I knew that if he wished to delay he had a goodreason for it. So I said, as quietly as I could:--“Don’t wait more than need be; you know, I am sure, what torture I amin.”“Ah, my child, that I do; and indeed there is no wish of me to add toyour anguish. But just think, what can we do, until all the world be atmovement. Then will come our time. I have thought and thought, and itseems to me that the simplest way is the best of all. Now we wish to getinto the house, but we have no key; is it not so?” I nodded.“Now suppose that you were, in truth, the owner of that house, and couldnot still get in; and think there was to you no conscience of thehousebreaker, what would you do?”“I should get a respectable locksmith, and set him to work to pick thelock for me.”“And your police, they would interfere, would they not?”“Oh, no! not if they knew the man was properly employed.”“Then,” he looked at me as keenly as he spoke, “all that is in doubt isthe conscience of the employer, and the belief of your policemen as towhether or no that employer has a good conscience or a bad one. Yourpolice must indeed be zealous men and clever--oh, so clever!--in readingthe heart, that they trouble themselves in such matter. No, no, myfriend Jonathan, you go take the lock off a hundred empty house in thisyour London, or of any city in the world; and if you do it as suchthings are rightly done, and at the time such things are rightly done,no one will interfere. I have read of a gentleman who owned a so finehouse in London, and when he went for months of summer to Switzerlandand lock up his house, some burglar came and broke window at back andgot in. Then he went and made open the shutters in front and walk outand in through the door, before the very eyes of the police. Then hehave an auction in that house, and advertise it, and put up big notice;and when the day come he sell off by a great auctioneer all the goods ofthat other man who own them. Then he go to a builder, and he sell himthat house, making an agreement that he pull it down and take all awaywithin a certain time. And your police and other authority help him allthey can. And when that owner come back from his holiday in Switzerlandhe find only an empty hole where his house had been. This was all done_en règle_; and in our work we shall be _en règle_ too. We shall not goso early that the policemen who have then little to think of, shall deemit strange; but we shall go after ten o’clock, when there are manyabout, and such things would be done were we indeed owners of thehouse.”I could not but see how right he was and the terrible despair of Mina’sface became relaxed a thought; there was hope in such good counsel. VanHelsing went on:--“When once within that house we may find more clues; at any rate some ofus can remain there whilst the rest find the other places where there bemore earth-boxes--at Bermondsey and Mile End.”Lord Godalming stood up. “I can be of some use here,” he said. “I shallwire to my people to have horses and carriages where they will be mostconvenient.”“Look here, old fellow,” said Morris, “it is a capital idea to have allready in case we want to go horsebacking; but don’t you think that oneof your snappy carriages with its heraldic adornments in a byway ofWalworth or Mile End would attract too much attention for our purposes?It seems to me that we ought to take cabs when we go south or east; andeven leave them somewhere near the neighbourhood we are going to.”“Friend Quincey is right!” said the Professor. “His head is what youcall in plane with the horizon. It is a difficult thing that we go todo, and we do not want no peoples to watch us if so it may.”Mina took a growing interest in everything and I was rejoiced to seethat the exigency of affairs was helping her to forget for a time theterrible experience of the night. She was very, very pale--almostghastly, and so thin that her lips were drawn away, showing her teeth insomewhat of prominence. I did not mention this last, lest it should giveher needless pain; but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think ofwhat had occurred with poor Lucy when the Count had sucked her blood. Asyet there was no sign of the teeth growing sharper; but the time as yetwas short, and there was time for fear.When we came to the discussion of the sequence of our efforts and of thedisposition of our forces, there were new sources of doubt. It wasfinally agreed that before starting for Piccadilly we should destroy theCount’s lair close at hand. In case he should find it out too soon, weshould thus be still ahead of him in our work of destruction; and hispresence in his purely material shape, and at his weakest, might give ussome new clue.As to the disposal of forces, it was suggested by the Professor that,after our visit to Carfax, we should all enter the house in Piccadilly;that the two doctors and I should remain there, whilst Lord Godalmingand Quincey found the lairs at Walworth and Mile End and destroyed them.It was possible, if not likely, the Professor urged, that the Countmight appear in Piccadilly during the day, and that if so we might beable to cope with him then and there. At any rate, we might be able tofollow him in force. To this plan I strenuously objected, and so far asmy going was concerned, for I said that I intended to stay and protectMina, I thought that my mind was made up on the subject; but Mina wouldnot listen to my objection. She said that there might be some law matterin which I could be useful; that amongst the Count’s papers might besome clue which I could understand out of my experience in Transylvania;and that, as it was, all the strength we could muster was required tocope with the Count’s extraordinary power. I had to give in, for Mina’sresolution was fixed; she said that it was the last hope for _her_ thatwe should all work together. “As for me,” she said, “I have no fear.Things have been as bad as they can be; and whatever may happen musthave in it some element of hope or comfort. Go, my husband! God can, ifHe wishes it, guard me as well alone as with any one present.” So Istarted up crying out: “Then in God’s name let us come at once, for weare losing time. The Count may come to Piccadilly earlier than wethink.”“Not so!” said Van Helsing, holding up his hand.“But why?” I asked.“Do you forget,” he said, with actually a smile, “that last night hebanqueted heavily, and will sleep late?”Did I forget! shall I ever--can I ever! Can any of us ever forget thatterrible scene! Mina struggled hard to keep her brave countenance; butthe pain overmastered her and she put her hands before her face, andshuddered whilst she moaned. Van Helsing had not intended to recall herfrightful experience. He had simply lost sight of her and her part inthe affair in his intellectual effort. When it struck him what he said,he was horrified at his thoughtlessness and tried to comfort her. “Oh,Madam Mina,” he said, “dear, dear Madam Mina, alas! that I of all who soreverence you should have said anything so forgetful. These stupid oldlips of mine and this stupid old head do not deserve so; but you willforget it, will you not?” He bent low beside her as he spoke; she tookhis hand, and looking at him through her tears, said hoarsely:--“No, I shall not forget, for it is well that I remember; and with it Ihave so much in memory of you that is sweet, that I take it alltogether. Now, you must all be going soon. Breakfast is ready, and wemust all eat that we may be strong.”Breakfast was a strange meal to us all. We tried to be cheerful andencourage each other, and Mina was the brightest and most cheerful ofus. When it was over, Van Helsing stood up and said:--“Now, my dear friends, we go forth to our terrible enterprise. Are weall armed, as we were on that night when first we visited our enemy’slair; armed against ghostly as well as carnal attack?” We all assuredhim. “Then it is well. Now, Madam Mina, you are in any case _quite_ safehere until the sunset; and before then we shall return--if---- We shallreturn! But before we go let me see you armed against personal attack. Ihave myself, since you came down, prepared your chamber by the placingof things of which we know, so that He may not enter. Now let me guardyourself. On your forehead I touch this piece of Sacred Wafer in thename of the Father, the Son, and----”There was a fearful scream which almost froze our hearts to hear. As hehad placed the Wafer on Mina’s forehead, it had seared it--had burnedinto the flesh as though it had been a piece of white-hot metal. My poordarling’s brain had told her the significance of the fact as quickly asher nerves received the pain of it; and the two so overwhelmed her thather overwrought nature had its voice in that dreadful scream. But thewords to her thought came quickly; the echo of the scream had not ceasedto ring on the air when there came the reaction, and she sank on herknees on the floor in an agony of abasement. Pulling her beautiful hairover her face, as the leper of old his mantle, she wailed out:--“Unclean! Unclean! Even the Almighty shuns my polluted flesh! I mustbear this mark of shame upon my forehead until the Judgment Day.” Theyall paused. I had thrown myself beside her in an agony of helplessgrief, and putting my arms around held her tight. For a few minutes oursorrowful hearts beat together, whilst the friends around us turned awaytheir eyes that ran tears silently. Then Van Helsing turned and saidgravely; so gravely that I could not help feeling that he was in someway inspired, and was stating things outside himself:--“It may be that you may have to bear that mark till God himself see fit,as He most surely shall, on the Judgment Day, to redress all wrongs ofthe earth and of His children that He has placed thereon. And oh, MadamMina, my dear, my dear, may we who love you be there to see, when thatred scar, the sign of God’s knowledge of what has been, shall pass away,and leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know. For so surely aswe live, that scar shall pass away when God sees right to lift theburden that is hard upon us. Till then we bear our Cross, as His Son didin obedience to His Will. It may be that we are chosen instruments ofHis good pleasure, and that we ascend to His bidding as that otherthrough stripes and shame; through tears and blood; through doubts andfears, and all that makes the difference between God and man.”There was hope in his words, and comfort; and they made for resignation.Mina and I both felt so, and simultaneously we each took one of the oldman’s hands and bent over and kissed it. Then without a word we allknelt down together, and, all holding hands, swore to be true to eachother. We men pledged ourselves to raise the veil of sorrow from thehead of her whom, each in his own way, we loved; and we prayed for helpand guidance in the terrible task which lay before us.It was then time to start. So I said farewell to Mina, a parting whichneither of us shall forget to our dying day; and we set out.To one thing I have made up my mind: if we find out that Mina must be avampire in the end, then she shall not go into that unknown and terribleland alone. I suppose it is thus that in old times one vampire meantmany; just as their hideous bodies could only rest in sacred earth, sothe holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for their ghastly ranks.We entered Carfax without trouble and found all things the same as onthe first occasion. It was hard to believe that amongst so prosaicsurroundings of neglect and dust and decay there was any ground for suchfear as already we knew. Had not our minds been made up, and had therenot been terrible memories to spur us on, we could hardly have proceededwith our task. We found no papers, or any sign of use in the house; andin the old chapel the great boxes looked just as we had seen them last.Dr. Van Helsing said to us solemnly as we stood before them:--“And now, my friends, we have a duty here to do. We must sterilise thisearth, so sacred of holy memories, that he has brought from a fardistant land for such fell use. He has chosen this earth because it hasbeen holy. Thus we defeat him with his own weapon, for we make it moreholy still. It was sanctified to such use of man, now we sanctify it toGod.” As he spoke he took from his bag a screwdriver and a wrench, andvery soon the top of one of the cases was thrown open. The earth smelledmusty and close; but we did not somehow seem to mind, for our attentionwas concentrated on the Professor. Taking from his box a piece of theSacred Wafer he laid it reverently on the earth, and then shutting downthe lid began to screw it home, we aiding him as he worked.One by one we treated in the same way each of the great boxes, and leftthem as we had found them to all appearance; but in each was a portionof the Host.When we closed the door behind us, the Professor said solemnly:--“So much is already done. If it may be that with all the others we canbe so successful, then the sunset of this evening may shine on MadamMina’s forehead all white as ivory and with no stain!”As we passed across the lawn on our way to the station to catch ourtrain we could see the front of the asylum. I looked eagerly, and in thewindow of my own room saw Mina. I waved my hand to her, and nodded totell that our work there was successfully accomplished. She nodded inreply to show that she understood. The last I saw, she was waving herhand in farewell. It was with a heavy heart that we sought the stationand just caught the train, which was steaming in as we reached theplatform.I have written this in the train.*       *       *       *       *_Piccadilly, 12:30 o’clock._--Just before we reached Fenchurch StreetLord Godalming said to me:--“Quincey and I will find a locksmith. You had better not come with us incase there should be any difficulty; for under the circumstances itwouldn’t seem so bad for us to break into an empty house. But you are asolicitor and the Incorporated Law Society might tell you that youshould have known better.” I demurred as to my not sharing any dangereven of odium, but he went on: “Besides, it will attract less attentionif there are not too many of us. My title will make it all right withthe locksmith, and with any policeman that may come along. You hadbetter go with Jack and the Professor and stay in the Green Park,somewhere in sight of the house; and when you see the door opened andthe smith has gone away, do you all come across. We shall be on thelookout for you, and shall let you in.”“The advice is good!” said Van Helsing, so we said no more. Godalmingand Morris hurried off in a cab, we following in another. At the cornerof Arlington Street our contingent got out and strolled into the GreenPark. My heart beat as I saw the house on which so much of our hope wascentred, looming up grim and silent in its deserted condition amongstits more lively and spruce-looking neighbours. We sat down on a benchwithin good view, and began to smoke cigars so as to attract as littleattention as possible. The minutes seemed to pass with leaden feet as wewaited for the coming of the others.At length we saw a four-wheeler drive up. Out of it, in leisurelyfashion, got Lord Godalming and Morris; and down from the box descendeda thick-set working man with his rush-woven basket of tools. Morris paidthe cabman, who touched his hat and drove away. Together the twoascended the steps, and Lord Godalming pointed out what he wanted done.The workman took off his coat leisurely and hung it on one of the spikesof the rail, saying something to a policeman who just then saunteredalong. The policeman nodded acquiescence, and the man kneeling downplaced his bag beside him. After searching through it, he took out aselection of tools which he produced to lay beside him in orderlyfashion. Then he stood up, looked into the keyhole, blew into it, andturning to his employers, made some remark. Lord Godalming smiled, andthe man lifted a good-sized bunch of keys; selecting one of them, hebegan to probe the lock, as if feeling his way with it. After fumblingabout for a bit he tried a second, and then a third. All at once thedoor opened under a slight push from him, and he and the two othersentered the hall. We sat still; my own cigar burnt furiously, but VanHelsing’s went cold altogether. We waited patiently as we saw theworkman come out and bring in his bag. Then he held the door partlyopen, steadying it with his knees, whilst he fitted a key to the lock.This he finally handed to Lord Godalming, who took out his purse andgave him something. The man touched his hat, took his bag, put on hiscoat and departed; not a soul took the slightest notice of the wholetransaction.When the man had fairly gone, we three crossed the street and knocked atthe door. It was immediately opened by Quincey Morris, beside whom stoodLord Godalming lighting a cigar.“The place smells so vilely,” said the latter as we came in. It didindeed smell vilely--like the old chapel at Carfax--and with ourprevious experience it was plain to us that the Count had been using theplace pretty freely. We moved to explore the house, all keeping togetherin case of attack; for we knew we had a strong and wily enemy to dealwith, and as yet we did not know whether the Count might not be in thehouse. In the dining-room, which lay at the back of the hall, we foundeight boxes of earth. Eight boxes only out of the nine, which we sought!Our work was not over, and would never be until we should have found themissing box. First we opened the shutters of the window which looked outacross a narrow stone-flagged yard at the blank face of a stable,pointed to look like the front of a miniature house. There were nowindows in it, so we were not afraid of being over-looked. We did notlose any time in examining the chests. With the tools which we hadbrought with us we opened them, one by one, and treated them as we hadtreated those others in the old chapel. It was evident to us that theCount was not at present in the house, and we proceeded to search forany of his effects.After a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms, from basement to attic,we came to the conclusion that the dining-room contained any effectswhich might belong to the Count; and so we proceeded to minutely examinethem. They lay in a sort of orderly disorder on the great dining-roomtable. There were title deeds of the Piccadilly house in a great bundle;deeds of the purchase of the houses at Mile End and Bermondsey;note-paper, envelopes, and pens and ink. All were covered up in thinwrapping paper to keep them from the dust. There were also a clothesbrush, a brush and comb, and a jug and basin--the latter containingdirty water which was reddened as if with blood. Last of all was alittle heap of keys of all sorts and sizes, probably those belonging tothe other houses. When we had examined this last find, Lord Godalmingand Quincey Morris taking accurate notes of the various addresses of thehouses in the East and the South, took with them the keys in a greatbunch, and set out to destroy the boxes in these places. The rest of usare, with what patience we can, waiting their return--or the coming ofthe Count.CHAPTER XXIIIDR. SEWARD’S DIARY_3 October._--The time seemed terribly long whilst we were waiting forthe coming of Godalming and Quincey Morris. The Professor tried to keepour minds active by using them all the time. I could see his beneficentpurpose, by the side glances which he threw from time to time at Harker.The poor fellow is overwhelmed in a misery that is appalling to see.Last night he was a frank, happy-looking man, with strong, youthfulface, full of energy, and with dark brown hair. To-day he is a drawn,haggard old man, whose white hair matches well with the hollow burningeyes and grief-written lines of his face. His energy is still intact; infact, he is like a living flame. This may yet be his salvation, for, ifall go well, it will tide him over the despairing period; he will then,in a kind of way, wake again to the realities of life. Poor fellow, Ithought my own trouble was bad enough, but his----! The Professor knowsthis well enough, and is doing his best to keep his mind active. What hehas been saying was, under the circumstances, of absorbing interest. Sowell as I can remember, here it is:--“I have studied, over and over again since they came into my hands, allthe papers relating to this monster; and the more I have studied, thegreater seems the necessity to utterly stamp him out. All through thereare signs of his advance; not only of his power, but of his knowledge ofit. As I learned from the researches of my friend Arminus of Buda-Pesth,he was in life a most wonderful man. Soldier, statesman, andalchemist--which latter was the highest development of thescience-knowledge of his time. He had a mighty brain, a learning beyondcompare, and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse. He dared even toattend the Scholomance, and there was no branch of knowledge of his timethat he did not essay. Well, in him the brain powers survived thephysical death; though it would seem that memory was not all complete.In some faculties of mind he has been, and is, only a child; but he isgrowing, and some things that were childish at the first are now ofman’s stature. He is experimenting, and doing it well; and if it had notbeen that we have crossed his path he would be yet--he may be yet if wefail--the father or furtherer of a new order of beings, whose road mustlead through Death, not Life.”Harker groaned and said, “And this is all arrayed against my darling!But how is he experimenting? The knowledge may help us to defeat him!”“He has all along, since his coming, been trying his power, slowly butsurely; that big child-brain of his is working. Well for us, it is, asyet, a child-brain; for had he dared, at the first, to attempt certainthings he would long ago have been beyond our power. However, he meansto succeed, and a man who has centuries before him can afford to waitand to go slow. _Festina lente_ may well be his motto.”“I fail to understand,” said Harker wearily. “Oh, do be more plain tome! Perhaps grief and trouble are dulling my brain.”The Professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as he spoke:--“Ah, my child, I will be plain. Do you not see how, of late, thismonster has been creeping into knowledge experimentally. How he has beenmaking use of the zoöphagous patient to effect his entry into friendJohn’s home; for your Vampire, though in all afterwards he can come whenand how he will, must at the first make entry only when asked thereto byan inmate. But these are not his most important experiments. Do we notsee how at the first all these so great boxes were moved by others. Heknew not then but that must be so. But all the time that so greatchild-brain of his was growing, and he began to consider whether hemight not himself move the box. So he began to help; and then, when hefound that this be all-right, he try to move them all alone. And so heprogress, and he scatter these graves of him; and none but he know wherethey are hidden. He may have intend to bury them deep in the ground. Sothat he only use them in the night, or at such time as he can change hisform, they do him equal well; and none may know these are hishiding-place! But, my child, do not despair; this knowledge come to himjust too late! Already all of his lairs but one be sterilise as for him;and before the sunset this shall be so. Then he have no place where hecan move and hide. I delayed this morning that so we might be sure. Isthere not more at stake for us than for him? Then why we not be evenmore careful than him? By my clock it is one hour and already, if all bewell, friend Arthur and Quincey are on their way to us. To-day is ourday, and we must go sure, if slow, and lose no chance. See! there arefive of us when those absent ones return.”Whilst he was speaking we were startled by a knock at the hall door, thedouble postman’s knock of the telegraph boy. We all moved out to thehall with one impulse, and Van Helsing, holding up his hand to us tokeep silence, stepped to the door and opened it. The boy handed in adespatch. The Professor closed the door again, and, after looking at thedirection, opened it and read aloud.“Look out for D. He has just now, 12:45, come from Carfax hurriedly andhastened towards the South. He seems to be going the round and may wantto see you: Mina.”There was a pause, broken by Jonathan Harker’s voice:--“Now, God be thanked, we shall soon meet!” Van Helsing turned to himquickly and said:--“God will act in His own way and time. Do not fear, and do not rejoiceas yet; for what we wish for at the moment may be our undoings.”“I care for nothing now,” he answered hotly, “except to wipe out thisbrute from the face of creation. I would sell my soul to do it!”“Oh, hush, hush, my child!” said Van Helsing. “God does not purchasesouls in this wise; and the Devil, though he may purchase, does not keepfaith. But God is merciful and just, and knows your pain and yourdevotion to that dear Madam Mina. Think you, how her pain would bedoubled, did she but hear your wild words. Do not fear any of us, we areall devoted to this cause, and to-day shall see the end. The time iscoming for action; to-day this Vampire is limit to the powers of man,and till sunset he may not change. It will take him time to arrivehere--see, it is twenty minutes past one--and there are yet some timesbefore he can hither come, be he never so quick. What we must hope foris that my Lord Arthur and Quincey arrive first.”About half an hour after we had received Mrs. Harker’s telegram, therecame a quiet, resolute knock at the hall door. It was just an ordinaryknock, such as is given hourly by thousands of gentlemen, but it madethe Professor’s heart and mine beat loudly. We looked at each other, andtogether moved out into the hall; we each held ready to use our variousarmaments--the spiritual in the left hand, the mortal in the right. VanHelsing pulled back the latch, and, holding the door half open, stoodback, having both hands ready for action. The gladness of our heartsmust have shown upon our faces when on the step, close to the door, wesaw Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris. They came quickly in and closedthe door behind them, the former saying, as they moved along thehall:--“It is all right. We found both places; six boxes in each and wedestroyed them all!”“Destroyed?” asked the Professor.“For him!” We were silent for a minute, and then Quincey said:--“There’s nothing to do but to wait here. If, however, he doesn’t turn upby five o’clock, we must start off; for it won’t do to leave Mrs. Harkeralone after sunset.”“He will be here before long now,” said Van Helsing, who had beenconsulting his pocket-book. “_Nota bene_, in Madam’s telegram he wentsouth from Carfax, that means he went to cross the river, and he couldonly do so at slack of tide, which should be something before oneo’clock. That he went south has a meaning for us. He is as yet onlysuspicious; and he went from Carfax first to the place where he wouldsuspect interference least. You must have been at Bermondsey only ashort time before him. That he is not here already shows that he went toMile End next. This took him some time; for he would then have to becarried over the river in some way. Believe me, my friends, we shall nothave long to wait now. We should have ready some plan of attack, so thatwe may throw away no chance. Hush, there is no time now. Have all yourarms! Be ready!” He held up a warning hand as he spoke, for we all couldhear a key softly inserted in the lock of the hall door.I could not but admire, even at such a moment, the way in which adominant spirit asserted itself. In all our hunting parties andadventures in different parts of the world, Quincey Morris had alwaysbeen the one to arrange the plan of action, and Arthur and I had beenaccustomed to obey him implicitly. Now, the old habit seemed to berenewed instinctively. With a swift glance around the room, he at oncelaid out our plan of attack, and, without speaking a word, with agesture, placed us each in position. Van Helsing, Harker, and I werejust behind the door, so that when it was opened the Professor couldguard it whilst we two stepped between the incomer and the door.Godalming behind and Quincey in front stood just out of sight ready tomove in front of the window. We waited in a suspense that made theseconds pass with nightmare slowness. The slow, careful steps came alongthe hall; the Count was evidently prepared for some surprise--at leasthe feared it.Suddenly with a single bound he leaped into the room, winning a way pastus before any of us could raise a hand to stay him. There was somethingso panther-like in the movement--something so unhuman, that it seemedto sober us all from the shock of his coming. The first to act wasHarker, who, with a quick movement, threw himself before the doorleading into the room in the front of the house. As the Count saw us, ahorrible sort of snarl passed over his face, showing the eye-teeth longand pointed; but the evil smile as quickly passed into a cold stare oflion-like disdain. His expression again changed as, with a singleimpulse, we all advanced upon him. It was a pity that we had not somebetter organised plan of attack, for even at the moment I wondered whatwe were to do. I did not myself know whether our lethal weapons wouldavail us anything. Harker evidently meant to try the matter, for he hadready his great Kukri knife and made a fierce and sudden cut at him. Theblow was a powerful one; only the diabolical quickness of the Count’sleap back saved him. A second less and the trenchant blade had shornethrough his heart. As it was, the point just cut the cloth of his coat,making a wide gap whence a bundle of bank-notes and a stream of goldfell out. The expression of the Count’s face was so hellish, that for amoment I feared for Harker, though I saw him throw the terrible knifealoft again for another stroke. Instinctively I moved forward with aprotective impulse, holding the Crucifix and Wafer in my left hand. Ifelt a mighty power fly along my arm; and it was without surprise that Isaw the monster cower back before a similar movement made spontaneouslyby each one of us. It would be impossible to describe the expression ofhate and baffled malignity--of anger and hellish rage--which came overthe Count’s face. His waxen hue became greenish-yellow by the contrastof his burning eyes, and the red scar on the forehead showed on thepallid skin like a palpitating wound. The next instant, with a sinuousdive he swept under Harker’s arm, ere his blow could fall, and, graspinga handful of the money from the floor, dashed across the room, threwhimself at the window. Amid the crash and glitter of the falling glass,he tumbled into the flagged area below. Through the sound of theshivering glass I could hear the “ting” of the gold, as some of thesovereigns fell on the flagging.We ran over and saw him spring unhurt from the ground. He, rushing upthe steps, crossed the flagged yard, and pushed open the stable door.There he turned and spoke to us:--“You think to baffle me, you--with your pale faces all in a row, likesheep in a butcher’s. You shall be sorry yet, each one of you! You thinkyou have left me without a place to rest; but I have more. My revenge isjust begun! I spread it over centuries, and time is on my side. Yourgirls that you all love are mine already; and through them you andothers shall yet be mine--my creatures, to do my bidding and to be myjackals when I want to feed. Bah!” With a contemptuous sneer, he passedquickly through the door, and we heard the rusty bolt creak as hefastened it behind him. A door beyond opened and shut. The first of usto speak was the Professor, as, realising the difficulty of followinghim through the stable, we moved toward the hall.“We have learnt something--much! Notwithstanding his brave words, hefears us; he fear time, he fear want! For if not, why he hurry so? Hisvery tone betray him, or my ears deceive. Why take that money? Youfollow quick. You are hunters of wild beast, and understand it so. Forme, I make sure that nothing here may be of use to him, if so that hereturn.” As he spoke he put the money remaining into his pocket; tookthe title-deeds in the bundle as Harker had left them, and swept theremaining things into the open fireplace, where he set fire to them witha match.Godalming and Morris had rushed out into the yard, and Harker hadlowered himself from the window to follow the Count. He had, however,bolted the stable door; and by the time they had forced it open therewas no sign of him. Van Helsing and I tried to make inquiry at the backof the house; but the mews was deserted and no one had seen him depart.It was now late in the afternoon, and sunset was not far off. We had torecognise that our game was up; with heavy hearts we agreed with theProfessor when he said:--“Let us go back to Madam Mina--poor, poor dear Madam Mina. All we can dojust now is done; and we can there, at least, protect her. But we neednot despair. There is but one more earth-box, and we must try to findit; when that is done all may yet be well.” I could see that he spoke asbravely as he could to comfort Harker. The poor fellow was quite brokendown; now and again he gave a low groan which he could not suppress--hewas thinking of his wife.With sad hearts we came back to my house, where we found Mrs. Harkerwaiting us, with an appearance of cheerfulness which did honour to herbravery and unselfishness. When she saw our faces, her own became aspale as death: for a second or two her eyes were closed as if she werein secret prayer; and then she said cheerfully:--“I can never thank you all enough. Oh, my poor darling!” As she spoke,she took her husband’s grey head in her hands and kissed it--“Lay yourpoor head here and rest it. All will yet be well, dear! God will protectus if He so will it in His good intent.” The poor fellow groaned. Therewas no place for words in his sublime misery.We had a sort of perfunctory supper together, and I think it cheered usall up somewhat. It was, perhaps, the mere animal heat of food to hungrypeople--for none of us had eaten anything since breakfast--or the senseof companionship may have helped us; but anyhow we were all lessmiserable, and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope. True toour promise, we told Mrs. Harker everything which had passed; andalthough she grew snowy white at times when danger had seemed tothreaten her husband, and red at others when his devotion to her wasmanifested, she listened bravely and with calmness. When we came to thepart where Harker had rushed at the Count so recklessly, she clung toher husband’s arm, and held it tight as though her clinging couldprotect him from any harm that might come. She said nothing, however,till the narration was all done, and matters had been brought right upto the present time. Then without letting go her husband’s hand shestood up amongst us and spoke. Oh, that I could give any idea of thescene; of that sweet, sweet, good, good woman in all the radiant beautyof her youth and animation, with the red scar on her forehead, of whichshe was conscious, and which we saw with grinding of ourteeth--remembering whence and how it came; her loving kindness againstour grim hate; her tender faith against all our fears and doubting; andwe, knowing that so far as symbols went, she with all her goodness andpurity and faith, was outcast from God.“Jonathan,” she said, and the word sounded like music on her lips it wasso full of love and tenderness, “Jonathan dear, and you all my true,true friends, I want you to bear something in mind through all thisdreadful time. I know that you must fight--that you must destroy even asyou destroyed the false Lucy so that the true Lucy might live hereafter;but it is not a work of hate. That poor soul who has wrought all thismisery is the saddest case of all. Just think what will be his joy whenhe, too, is destroyed in his worser part that his better part may havespiritual immortality. You must be pitiful to him, too, though it maynot hold your hands from his destruction.”As she spoke I could see her husband’s face darken and draw together, asthough the passion in him were shrivelling his being to its core.Instinctively the clasp on his wife’s hand grew closer, till hisknuckles looked white. She did not flinch from the pain which I knew shemust have suffered, but looked at him with eyes that were more appealingthan ever. As she stopped speaking he leaped to his feet, almost tearinghis hand from hers as he spoke:--“May God give him into my hand just for long enough to destroy thatearthly life of him which we are aiming at. If beyond it I could sendhis soul for ever and ever to burning hell I would do it!”“Oh, hush! oh, hush! in the name of the good God. Don’t say such things,Jonathan, my husband; or you will crush me with fear and horror. Justthink, my dear--I have been thinking all this long, long day of it--that... perhaps ... some day ... I, too, may need such pity; and that someother like you--and with equal cause for anger--may deny it to me! Oh,my husband! my husband, indeed I would have spared you such a thoughthad there been another way; but I pray that God may not have treasuredyour wild words, except as the heart-broken wail of a very loving andsorely stricken man. Oh, God, let these poor white hairs go in evidenceof what he has suffered, who all his life has done no wrong, and on whomso many sorrows have come.”We men were all in tears now. There was no resisting them, and we weptopenly. She wept, too, to see that her sweeter counsels had prevailed.Her husband flung himself on his knees beside her, and putting his armsround her, hid his face in the folds of her dress. Van Helsing beckonedto us and we stole out of the room, leaving the two loving hearts alonewith their God.Before they retired the Professor fixed up the room against any comingof the Vampire, and assured Mrs. Harker that she might rest in peace.She tried to school herself to the belief, and, manifestly for herhusband’s sake, tried to seem content. It was a brave struggle; and was,I think and believe, not without its reward. Van Helsing had placed athand a bell which either of them was to sound in case of any emergency.When they had retired, Quincey, Godalming, and I arranged that we shouldsit up, dividing the night between us, and watch over the safety of thepoor stricken lady. The first watch falls to Quincey, so the rest of usshall be off to bed as soon as we can. Godalming has already turned in,for his is the second watch. Now that my work is done I, too, shall goto bed._Jonathan Harker’s Journal.__3-4 October, close to midnight._--I thought yesterday would never end.There was over me a yearning for sleep, in some sort of blind beliefthat to wake would be to find things changed, and that any change mustnow be for the better. Before we parted, we discussed what our next stepwas to be, but we could arrive at no result. All we knew was that oneearth-box remained, and that the Count alone knew where it was. If hechooses to lie hidden, he may baffle us for years; and in themeantime!--the thought is too horrible, I dare not think of it even now.This I know: that if ever there was a woman who was all perfection, thatone is my poor wronged darling. I love her a thousand times more for hersweet pity of last night, a pity that made my own hate of the monsterseem despicable. Surely God will not permit the world to be the poorerby the loss of such a creature. This is hope to me. We are all driftingreefwards now, and faith is our only anchor. Thank God! Mina issleeping, and sleeping without dreams. I fear what her dreams might belike, with such terrible memories to ground them in. She has not been socalm, within my seeing, since the sunset. Then, for a while, there cameover her face a repose which was like spring after the blasts of March.I thought at the time that it was the softness of the red sunset on herface, but somehow now I think it has a deeper meaning. I am not sleepymyself, though I am weary--weary to death. However, I must try to sleep;for there is to-morrow to think of, and there is no rest for meuntil....*       *       *       *       *_Later._--I must have fallen asleep, for I was awaked by Mina, who wassitting up in bed, with a startled look on her face. I could see easily,for we did not leave the room in darkness; she had placed a warning handover my mouth, and now she whispered in my ear:--“Hush! there is someone in the corridor!” I got up softly, and crossingthe room, gently opened the door.Just outside, stretched on a mattress, lay Mr. Morris, wide awake. Heraised a warning hand for silence as he whispered to me:--“Hush! go back to bed; it is all right. One of us will be here allnight. We don’t mean to take any chances!”His look and gesture forbade discussion, so I came back and told Mina.She sighed and positively a shadow of a smile stole over her poor, paleface as she put her arms round me and said softly:--“Oh, thank God for good brave men!” With a sigh she sank back again tosleep. I write this now as I am not sleepy, though I must try again.*       *       *       *       *_4 October, morning._--Once again during the night I was wakened byMina. This time we had all had a good sleep, for the grey of the comingdawn was making the windows into sharp oblongs, and the gas flame waslike a speck rather than a disc of light. She said to me hurriedly:--“Go, call the Professor. I want to see him at once.”“Why?” I asked.“I have an idea. I suppose it must have come in the night, and maturedwithout my knowing it. He must hypnotise me before the dawn, and then Ishall be able to speak. Go quick, dearest; the time is getting close.” Iwent to the door. Dr. Seward was resting on the mattress, and, seeingme, he sprang to his feet.“Is anything wrong?” he asked, in alarm.“No,” I replied; “but Mina wants to see Dr. Van Helsing at once.”“I will go,” he said, and hurried into the Professor’s room.In two or three minutes later Van Helsing was in the room in hisdressing-gown, and Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming were with Dr. Seward atthe door asking questions. When the Professor saw Mina smile--apositive smile ousted the anxiety of his face; he rubbed his hands as hesaid:--“Oh, my dear Madam Mina, this is indeed a change. See! friend Jonathan,we have got our dear Madam Mina, as of old, back to us to-day!” Thenturning to her, he said, cheerfully: “And what am I do for you? For atthis hour you do not want me for nothings.”“I want you to hypnotise me!” she said. “Do it before the dawn, for Ifeel that then I can speak, and speak freely. Be quick, for the time isshort!” Without a word he motioned her to sit up in bed.Looking fixedly at her, he commenced to make passes in front of her,from over the top of her head downward, with each hand in turn. Minagazed at him fixedly for a few minutes, during which my own heart beatlike a trip hammer, for I felt that some crisis was at hand. Graduallyher eyes closed, and she sat, stock still; only by the gentle heaving ofher bosom could one know that she was alive. The Professor made a fewmore passes and then stopped, and I could see that his forehead wascovered with great beads of perspiration. Mina opened her eyes; but shedid not seem the same woman. There was a far-away look in her eyes, andher voice had a sad dreaminess which was new to me. Raising his hand toimpose silence, the Professor motioned to me to bring the others in.They came on tip-toe, closing the door behind them, and stood at thefoot of the bed, looking on. Mina appeared not to see them. Thestillness was broken by Van Helsing’s voice speaking in a low level tonewhich would not break the current of her thoughts:--“Where are you?” The answer came in a neutral way:--“I do not know. Sleep has no place it can call its own.” For severalminutes there was silence. Mina sat rigid, and the Professor stoodstaring at her fixedly; the rest of us hardly dared to breathe. The roomwas growing lighter; without taking his eyes from Mina’s face, Dr. VanHelsing motioned me to pull up the blind. I did so, and the day seemedjust upon us. A red streak shot up, and a rosy light seemed to diffuseitself through the room. On the instant the Professor spoke again:--“Where are you now?” The answer came dreamily, but with intention; itwere as though she were interpreting something. I have heard her use thesame tone when reading her shorthand notes.“I do not know. It is all strange to me!”“What do you see?”“I can see nothing; it is all dark.”“What do you hear?” I could detect the strain in the Professor’s patientvoice.“The lapping of water. It is gurgling by, and little waves leap. I canhear them on the outside.”“Then you are on a ship?” We all looked at each other, trying to gleansomething each from the other. We were afraid to think. The answer camequick:--“Oh, yes!”“What else do you hear?”“The sound of men stamping overhead as they run about. There is thecreaking of a chain, and the loud tinkle as the check of the capstanfalls into the rachet.”“What are you doing?”“I am still--oh, so still. It is like death!” The voice faded away intoa deep breath as of one sleeping, and the open eyes closed again.By this time the sun had risen, and we were all in the full light ofday. Dr. Van Helsing placed his hands on Mina’s shoulders, and laid herhead down softly on her pillow. She lay like a sleeping child for a fewmoments, and then, with a long sigh, awoke and stared in wonder to seeus all around her. “Have I been talking in my sleep?” was all she said.She seemed, however, to know the situation without telling, though shewas eager to know what she had told. The Professor repeated theconversation, and she said:--“Then there is not a moment to lose: it may not be yet too late!” Mr.Morris and Lord Godalming started for the door but the Professor’s calmvoice called them back:--“Stay, my friends. That ship, wherever it was, was weighing anchorwhilst she spoke. There are many ships weighing anchor at the moment inyour so great Port of London. Which of them is it that you seek? God bethanked that we have once again a clue, though whither it may lead us weknow not. We have been blind somewhat; blind after the manner of men,since when we can look back we see what we might have seen lookingforward if we had been able to see what we might have seen! Alas, butthat sentence is a puddle; is it not? We can know now what was in theCount’s mind, when he seize that money, though Jonathan’s so fierceknife put him in the danger that even he dread. He meant escape. Hearme, ESCAPE! He saw that with but one earth-box left, and a pack of menfollowing like dogs after a fox, this London was no place for him. Hehave take his last earth-box on board a ship, and he leave the land. Hethink to escape, but no! we follow him. Tally Ho! as friend Arthur wouldsay when he put on his red frock! Our old fox is wily; oh! so wily, andwe must follow with wile. I, too, am wily and I think his mind in alittle while. In meantime we may rest and in peace, for there are watersbetween us which he do not want to pass, and which he could not if hewould--unless the ship were to touch the land, and then only at full orslack tide. See, and the sun is just rose, and all day to sunset is tous. Let us take bath, and dress, and have breakfast which we all need,and which we can eat comfortably since he be not in the same land withus.” Mina looked at him appealingly as she asked:--“But why need we seek him further, when he is gone away from us?” Hetook her hand and patted it as he replied:--“Ask me nothings as yet. When we have breakfast, then I answer allquestions.” He would say no more, and we separated to dress.After breakfast Mina repeated her question. He looked at her gravely fora minute and then said sorrowfully:--“Because my dear, dear Madam Mina, now more than ever must we find himeven if we have to follow him to the jaws of Hell!” She grew paler asshe asked faintly:--“Why?”“Because,” he answered solemnly, “he can live for centuries, and you arebut mortal woman. Time is now to be dreaded--since once he put that markupon your throat.”I was just in time to catch her as she fell forward in a faint.CHAPTER XXIVDR. SEWARD’S PHONOGRAPH DIARY, SPOKEN BY VAN HELSINGThis to Jonathan Harker.You are to stay with your dear Madam Mina. We shall go to make oursearch--if I can call it so, for it is not search but knowing, and weseek confirmation only. But do you stay and take care of her to-day.This is your best and most holiest office. This day nothing can find himhere. Let me tell you that so you will know what we four know already,for I have tell them. He, our enemy, have gone away; he have gone backto his Castle in Transylvania. I know it so well, as if a great hand offire wrote it on the wall. He have prepare for this in some way, andthat last earth-box was ready to ship somewheres. For this he took themoney; for this he hurry at the last, lest we catch him before the sungo down. It was his last hope, save that he might hide in the tomb thathe think poor Miss Lucy, being as he thought like him, keep open to him.But there was not of time. When that fail he make straight for his lastresource--his last earth-work I might say did I wish _double entente_.He is clever, oh, so clever! he know that his game here was finish; andso he decide he go back home. He find ship going by the route he came,and he go in it. We go off now to find what ship, and whither bound;when we have discover that, we come back and tell you all. Then we willcomfort you and poor dear Madam Mina with new hope. For it will be hopewhen you think it over: that all is not lost. This very creature that wepursue, he take hundreds of years to get so far as London; and yet inone day, when we know of the disposal of him we drive him out. He isfinite, though he is powerful to do much harm and suffers not as we do.But we are strong, each in our purpose; and we are all more strongtogether. Take heart afresh, dear husband of Madam Mina. This battle isbut begun, and in the end we shall win--so sure as that God sits on highto watch over His children. Therefore be of much comfort till we return.VAN HELSING._Jonathan Harker’s Journal.__4 October._--When I read to Mina, Van Helsing’s message in thephonograph, the poor girl brightened up considerably. Already thecertainty that the Count is out of the country has given her comfort;and comfort is strength to her. For my own part, now that his horribledanger is not face to face with us, it seems almost impossible tobelieve in it. Even my own terrible experiences in Castle Dracula seemlike a long-forgotten dream. Here in the crisp autumn air in the brightsunlight----Alas! how can I disbelieve! In the midst of my thought my eye fell onthe red scar on my poor darling’s white forehead. Whilst that lasts,there can be no disbelief. And afterwards the very memory of it willkeep faith crystal clear. Mina and I fear to be idle, so we have beenover all the diaries again and again. Somehow, although the realityseems greater each time, the pain and the fear seem less. There issomething of a guiding purpose manifest throughout, which is comforting.Mina says that perhaps we are the instruments of ultimate good. It maybe! I shall try to think as she does. We have never spoken to each otheryet of the future. It is better to wait till we see the Professor andthe others after their investigations.The day is running by more quickly than I ever thought a day could runfor me again. It is now three o’clock._Mina Harker’s Journal.__5 October, 5 p. m._--Our meeting for report. Present: Professor VanHelsing, Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, Mr. Quincey Morris, JonathanHarker, Mina Harker.Dr. Van Helsing described what steps were taken during the day todiscover on what boat and whither bound Count Dracula made his escape:--“As I knew that he wanted to get back to Transylvania, I felt sure thathe must go by the Danube mouth; or by somewhere in the Black Sea, sinceby that way he come. It was a dreary blank that was before us. _Omneignotum pro magnifico_; and so with heavy hearts we start to find whatships leave for the Black Sea last night. He was in sailing ship, sinceMadam Mina tell of sails being set. These not so important as to go inyour list of the shipping in the _Times_, and so we go, by suggestion ofLord Godalming, to your Lloyd’s, where are note of all ships that sail,however so small. There we find that only one Black-Sea-bound ship goout with the tide. She is the _Czarina Catherine_, and she sail fromDoolittle’s Wharf for Varna, and thence on to other parts and up theDanube. ‘Soh!’ said I, ‘this is the ship whereon is the Count.’ So offwe go to Doolittle’s Wharf, and there we find a man in an office of woodso small that the man look bigger than the office. From him we inquireof the goings of the _Czarina Catherine_. He swear much, and he red faceand loud of voice, but he good fellow all the same; and when Quinceygive him something from his pocket which crackle as he roll it up, andput it in a so small bag which he have hid deep in his clothing, hestill better fellow and humble servant to us. He come with us, and askmany men who are rough and hot; these be better fellows too when theyhave been no more thirsty. They say much of blood and bloom, and ofothers which I comprehend not, though I guess what they mean; butnevertheless they tell us all things which we want to know.“They make known to us among them, how last afternoon at about fiveo’clock comes a man so hurry. A tall man, thin and pale, with high noseand teeth so white, and eyes that seem to be burning. That he be all inblack, except that he have a hat of straw which suit not him or thetime. That he scatter his money in making quick inquiry as to what shipsails for the Black Sea and for where. Some took him to the office andthen to the ship, where he will not go aboard but halt at shore end ofgang-plank, and ask that the captain come to him. The captain come, whentold that he will be pay well; and though he swear much at the first heagree to term. Then the thin man go and some one tell him where horseand cart can be hired. He go there and soon he come again, himselfdriving cart on which a great box; this he himself lift down, though ittake several to put it on truck for the ship. He give much talk tocaptain as to how and where his box is to be place; but the captain likeit not and swear at him in many tongues, and tell him that if he like hecan come and see where it shall be. But he say ‘no’; that he come notyet, for that he have much to do. Whereupon the captain tell him that hehad better be quick--with blood--for that his ship will leave theplace--of blood--before the turn of the tide--with blood. Then the thinman smile and say that of course he must go when he think fit; but hewill be surprise if he go quite so soon. The captain swear again,polyglot, and the thin man make him bow, and thank him, and say that hewill so far intrude on his kindness as to come aboard before thesailing. Final the captain, more red than ever, and in more tongues tellhim that he doesn’t want no Frenchmen--with bloom upon them and alsowith blood--in his ship--with blood on her also. And so, after askingwhere there might be close at hand a ship where he might purchase shipforms, he departed.“No one knew where he went ‘or bloomin’ well cared,’ as they said, forthey had something else to think of--well with blood again; for it soonbecame apparent to all that the _Czarina Catherine_ would not sail aswas expected. A thin mist began to creep up from the river, and it grew,and grew; till soon a dense fog enveloped the ship and all around her.The captain swore polyglot--very polyglot--polyglot with bloom andblood; but he could do nothing. The water rose and rose; and he began tofear that he would lose the tide altogether. He was in no friendly mood,when just at full tide, the thin man came up the gang-plank again andasked to see where his box had been stowed. Then the captain repliedthat he wished that he and his box--old and with much bloom andblood--were in hell. But the thin man did not be offend, and went downwith the mate and saw where it was place, and came up and stood awhileon deck in fog. He must have come off by himself, for none notice him.Indeed they thought not of him; for soon the fog begin to melt away, andall was clear again. My friends of the thirst and the language that wasof bloom and blood laughed, as they told how the captain’s swearsexceeded even his usual polyglot, and was more than ever full ofpicturesque, when on questioning other mariners who were on movement upand down on the river that hour, he found that few of them had seen anyof fog at all, except where it lay round the wharf. However, the shipwent out on the ebb tide; and was doubtless by morning far down theriver mouth. She was by then, when they told us, well out to sea.“And so, my dear Madam Mina, it is that we have to rest for a time, forour enemy is on the sea, with the fog at his command, on his way to theDanube mouth. To sail a ship takes time, go she never so quick; and whenwe start we go on land more quick, and we meet him there. Our best hopeis to come on him when in the box between sunrise and sunset; for thenhe can make no struggle, and we may deal with him as we should. Thereare days for us, in which we can make ready our plan. We know all aboutwhere he go; for we have seen the owner of the ship, who have shown usinvoices and all papers that can be. The box we seek is to be landed inVarna, and to be given to an agent, one Ristics who will there presenthis credentials; and so our merchant friend will have done his part.When he ask if there be any wrong, for that so, he can telegraph andhave inquiry made at Varna, we say ‘no’; for what is to be done is notfor police or of the customs. It must be done by us alone and in our ownway.”When Dr. Van Helsing had done speaking, I asked him if he were certainthat the Count had remained on board the ship. He replied: “We have thebest proof of that: your own evidence, when in the hypnotic trance thismorning.” I asked him again if it were really necessary that they shouldpursue the Count, for oh! I dread Jonathan leaving me, and I know thathe would surely go if the others went. He answered in growing passion,at first quietly. As he went on, however, he grew more angry and moreforceful, till in the end we could not but see wherein was at least someof that personal dominance which made him so long a master amongstmen:--“Yes, it is necessary--necessary--necessary! For your sake in the first,and then for the sake of humanity. This monster has done much harmalready, in the narrow scope where he find himself, and in the shorttime when as yet he was only as a body groping his so small measure indarkness and not knowing. All this have I told these others; you, mydear Madam Mina, will learn it in the phonograph of my friend John, orin that of your husband. I have told them how the measure of leaving hisown barren land--barren of peoples--and coming to a new land where lifeof man teems till they are like the multitude of standing corn, was thework of centuries. Were another of the Un-Dead, like him, to try to dowhat he has done, perhaps not all the centuries of the world that havebeen, or that will be, could aid him. With this one, all the forces ofnature that are occult and deep and strong must have worked together insome wondrous way. The very place, where he have been alive, Un-Dead forall these centuries, is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemicalworld. There are deep caverns and fissures that reach none know whither.There have been volcanoes, some of whose openings still send out watersof strange properties, and gases that kill or make to vivify. Doubtless,there is something magnetic or electric in some of these combinations ofoccult forces which work for physical life in strange way; and inhimself were from the first some great qualities. In a hard and warliketime he was celebrate that he have more iron nerve, more subtle brain,more braver heart, than any man. In him some vital principle have instrange way found their utmost; and as his body keep strong and grow andthrive, so his brain grow too. All this without that diabolic aid whichis surely to him; for it have to yield to the powers that come from,and are, symbolic of good. And now this is what he is to us. He haveinfect you--oh, forgive me, my dear, that I must say such; but it is forgood of you that I speak. He infect you in such wise, that even if he dono more, you have only to live--to live in your own old, sweet way; andso in time, death, which is of man’s common lot and with God’s sanction,shall make you like to him. This must not be! We have sworn togetherthat it must not. Thus are we ministers of God’s own wish: that theworld, and men for whom His Son die, will not be given over to monsters,whose very existence would defame Him. He have allowed us to redeem onesoul already, and we go out as the old knights of the Cross to redeemmore. Like them we shall travel towards the sunrise; and like them, ifwe fall, we fall in good cause.” He paused and I said:--“But will not the Count take his rebuff wisely? Since he has been drivenfrom England, will he not avoid it, as a tiger does the village fromwhich he has been hunted?”“Aha!” he said, “your simile of the tiger good, for me, and I shalladopt him. Your man-eater, as they of India call the tiger who has oncetasted blood of the human, care no more for the other prey, but prowlunceasing till he get him. This that we hunt from our village is atiger, too, a man-eater, and he never cease to prowl. Nay, in himself heis not one to retire and stay afar. In his life, his living life, he goover the Turkey frontier and attack his enemy on his own ground; he bebeaten back, but did he stay? No! He come again, and again, and again.Look at his persistence and endurance. With the child-brain that was tohim he have long since conceive the idea of coming to a great city. Whatdoes he do? He find out the place of all the world most of promise forhim. Then he deliberately set himself down to prepare for the task. Hefind in patience just how is his strength, and what are his powers. Hestudy new tongues. He learn new social life; new environment of oldways, the politic, the law, the finance, the science, the habit of a newland and a new people who have come to be since he was. His glimpse thathe have had, whet his appetite only and enkeen his desire. Nay, it helphim to grow as to his brain; for it all prove to him how right he was atthe first in his surmises. He have done this alone; all alone! from aruin tomb in a forgotten land. What more may he not do when the greaterworld of thought is open to him. He that can smile at death, as we knowhim; who can flourish in the midst of diseases that kill off wholepeoples. Oh, if such an one was to come from God, and not the Devil,what a force for good might he not be in this old world of ours. But weare pledged to set the world free. Our toil must be in silence, and ourefforts all in secret; for in this enlightened age, when men believe noteven what they see, the doubting of wise men would be his greateststrength. It would be at once his sheath and his armour, and his weaponsto destroy us, his enemies, who are willing to peril even our own soulsfor the safety of one we love--for the good of mankind, and for thehonour and glory of God.”After a general discussion it was determined that for to-night nothingbe definitely settled; that we should all sleep on the facts, and try tothink out the proper conclusions. To-morrow, at breakfast, we are tomeet again, and, after making our conclusions known to one another, weshall decide on some definite cause of action.*       *       *       *       *I feel a wonderful peace and rest to-night. It is as if some hauntingpresence were removed from me. Perhaps ...My surmise was not finished, could not be; for I caught sight in themirror of the red mark upon my forehead; and I knew that I was stillunclean._Dr. Seward’s Diary.__5 October._--We all rose early, and I think that sleep did much foreach and all of us. When we met at early breakfast there was moregeneral cheerfulness than any of us had ever expected to experienceagain.It is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature. Letany obstructing cause, no matter what, be removed in any way--even bydeath--and we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment. Morethan once as we sat around the table, my eyes opened in wonder whetherthe whole of the past days had not been a dream. It was only when Icaught sight of the red blotch on Mrs. Harker’s forehead that I wasbrought back to reality. Even now, when I am gravely revolving thematter, it is almost impossible to realise that the cause of all ourtrouble is still existent. Even Mrs. Harker seems to lose sight of hertrouble for whole spells; it is only now and again, when somethingrecalls it to her mind, that she thinks of her terrible scar. We are tomeet here in my study in half an hour and decide on our course ofaction. I see only one immediate difficulty, I know it by instinctrather than reason: we shall all have to speak frankly; and yet I fearthat in some mysterious way poor Mrs. Harker’s tongue is tied. I _know_that she forms conclusions of her own, and from all that has been I canguess how brilliant and how true they must be; but she will not, orcannot, give them utterance. I have mentioned this to Van Helsing, andhe and I are to talk it over when we are alone. I suppose it is some ofthat horrid poison which has got into her veins beginning to work. TheCount had his own purposes when he gave her what Van Helsing called “theVampire’s baptism of blood.” Well, there may be a poison that distilsitself out of good things; in an age when the existence of ptomaines isa mystery we should not wonder at anything! One thing I know: that if myinstinct be true regarding poor Mrs. Harker’s silences, then there is aterrible difficulty--an unknown danger--in the work before us. The samepower that compels her silence may compel her speech. I dare not thinkfurther; for so I should in my thoughts dishonour a noble woman!Van Helsing is coming to my study a little before the others. I shalltry to open the subject with him.*       *       *       *       *_Later._--When the Professor came in, we talked over the state ofthings. I could see that he had something on his mind which he wanted tosay, but felt some hesitancy about broaching the subject. After beatingabout the bush a little, he said suddenly:--“Friend John, there is something that you and I must talk of alone, justat the first at any rate. Later, we may have to take the others into ourconfidence”; then he stopped, so I waited; he went on:--“Madam Mina, our poor, dear Madam Mina is changing.” A cold shiver ranthrough me to find my worst fears thus endorsed. Van Helsingcontinued:--“With the sad experience of Miss Lucy, we must this time be warnedbefore things go too far. Our task is now in reality more difficult thanever, and this new trouble makes every hour of the direst importance. Ican see the characteristics of the vampire coming in her face. It is nowbut very, very slight; but it is to be seen if we have eyes to noticewithout to prejudge. Her teeth are some sharper, and at times her eyesare more hard. But these are not all, there is to her the silence nowoften; as so it was with Miss Lucy. She did not speak, even when shewrote that which she wished to be known later. Now my fear is this. Ifit be that she can, by our hypnotic trance, tell what the Count see andhear, is it not more true that he who have hypnotise her first, and whohave drink of her very blood and make her drink of his, should, if hewill, compel her mind to disclose to him that which she know?” I noddedacquiescence; he went on:--“Then, what we must do is to prevent this; we must keep her ignorant ofour intent, and so she cannot tell what she know not. This is a painfultask! Oh, so painful that it heart-break me to think of; but it must be.When to-day we meet, I must tell her that for reason which we will notto speak she must not more be of our council, but be simply guarded byus.” He wiped his forehead, which had broken out in profuse perspirationat the thought of the pain which he might have to inflict upon the poorsoul already so tortured. I knew that it would be some sort of comfortto him if I told him that I also had come to the same conclusion; for atany rate it would take away the pain of doubt. I told him, and theeffect was as I expected.It is now close to the time of our general gathering. Van Helsing hasgone away to prepare for the meeting, and his painful part of it. Ireally believe his purpose is to be able to pray alone.*       *       *       *       *_Later._--At the very outset of our meeting a great personal relief wasexperienced by both Van Helsing and myself. Mrs. Harker had sent amessage by her husband to say that she would not join us at present, asshe thought it better that we should be free to discuss our movementswithout her presence to embarrass us. The Professor and I looked at eachother for an instant, and somehow we both seemed relieved. For my ownpart, I thought that if Mrs. Harker realised the danger herself, it wasmuch pain as well as much danger averted. Under the circumstances weagreed, by a questioning look and answer, with finger on lip, topreserve silence in our suspicions, until we should have been able toconfer alone again. We went at once into our Plan of Campaign. VanHelsing roughly put the facts before us first:--“The _Czarina Catherine_ left the Thames yesterday morning. It will takeher at the quickest speed she has ever made at least three weeks toreach Varna; but we can travel overland to the same place in three days.Now, if we allow for two days less for the ship’s voyage, owing to suchweather influences as we know that the Count can bring to bear; and ifwe allow a whole day and night for any delays which may occur to us,then we have a margin of nearly two weeks. Thus, in order to be quitesafe, we must leave here on 17th at latest. Then we shall at any ratebe in Varna a day before the ship arrives, and able to make suchpreparations as may be necessary. Of course we shall all go armed--armedagainst evil things, spiritual as well as physical.” Here Quincey Morrisadded:--“I understand that the Count comes from a wolf country, and it may bethat he shall get there before us. I propose that we add Winchesters toour armament. I have a kind of belief in a Winchester when there is anytrouble of that sort around. Do you remember, Art, when we had the packafter us at Tobolsk? What wouldn’t we have given then for a repeaterapiece!”“Good!” said Van Helsing, “Winchesters it shall be. Quincey’s head islevel at all times, but most so when there is to hunt, metaphor be moredishonour to science than wolves be of danger to man. In the meantime wecan do nothing here; and as I think that Varna is not familiar to any ofus, why not go there more soon? It is as long to wait here as there.To-night and to-morrow we can get ready, and then, if all be well, wefour can set out on our journey.”“We four?” said Harker interrogatively, looking from one to another ofus.“Of course!” answered the Professor quickly, “you must remain to takecare of your so sweet wife!” Harker was silent for awhile and then saidin a hollow voice:--“Let us talk of that part of it in the morning. I want to consult withMina.” I thought that now was the time for Van Helsing to warn him notto disclose our plans to her; but he took no notice. I looked at himsignificantly and coughed. For answer he put his finger on his lips andturned away._Jonathan Harker’s Journal.__5 October, afternoon._--For some time after our meeting this morning Icould not think. The new phases of things leave my mind in a state ofwonder which allows no room for active thought. Mina’s determination notto take any part in the discussion set me thinking; and as I could notargue the matter with her, I could only guess. I am as far as ever froma solution now. The way the others received it, too, puzzled me; thelast time we talked of the subject we agreed that there was to be nomore concealment of anything amongst us. Mina is sleeping now, calmlyand sweetly like a little child. Her lips are curved and her face beamswith happiness. Thank God, there are such moments still for her.*       *       *       *       *_Later._--How strange it all is. I sat watching Mina’s happy sleep, andcame as near to being happy myself as I suppose I shall ever be. As theevening drew on, and the earth took its shadows from the sun sinkinglower, the silence of the room grew more and more solemn to me. All atonce Mina opened her eyes, and looking at me tenderly, said:--“Jonathan, I want you to promise me something on your word of honour. Apromise made to me, but made holily in God’s hearing, and not to bebroken though I should go down on my knees and implore you with bittertears. Quick, you must make it to me at once.”“Mina,” I said, “a promise like that, I cannot make at once. I may haveno right to make it.”“But, dear one,” she said, with such spiritual intensity that her eyeswere like pole stars, “it is I who wish it; and it is not for myself.You can ask Dr. Van Helsing if I am not right; if he disagrees you maydo as you will. Nay, more, if you all agree, later, you are absolvedfrom the promise.”“I promise!” I said, and for a moment she looked supremely happy; thoughto me all happiness for her was denied by the red scar on her forehead.She said:--“Promise me that you will not tell me anything of the plans formed forthe campaign against the Count. Not by word, or inference, orimplication; not at any time whilst this remains to me!” and shesolemnly pointed to the scar. I saw that she was in earnest, and saidsolemnly:--“I promise!” and as I said it I felt that from that instant a door hadbeen shut between us.*       *       *       *       *_Later, midnight._--Mina has been bright and cheerful all the evening.So much so that all the rest seemed to take courage, as if infectedsomewhat with her gaiety; as a result even I myself felt as if the pallof gloom which weighs us down were somewhat lifted. We all retiredearly. Mina is now sleeping like a little child; it is a wonderful thingthat her faculty of sleep remains to her in the midst of her terribletrouble. Thank God for it, for then at least she can forget her care.Perhaps her example may affect me as her gaiety did to-night. I shalltry it. Oh! for a dreamless sleep.*       *       *       *       *_6 October, morning._--Another surprise. Mina woke me early, about thesame time as yesterday, and asked me to bring Dr. Van Helsing. I thoughtthat it was another occasion for hypnotism, and without question wentfor the Professor. He had evidently expected some such call, for I foundhim dressed in his room. His door was ajar, so that he could hear theopening of the door of our room. He came at once; as he passed into theroom, he asked Mina if the others might come, too.“No,” she said quite simply, “it will not be necessary. You can tellthem just as well. I must go with you on your journey.”Dr. Van Helsing was as startled as I was. After a moment’s pause heasked:--“But why?”“You must take me with you. I am safer with you, and you shall be safer,too.”“But why, dear Madam Mina? You know that your safety is our solemnestduty. We go into danger, to which you are, or may be, more liable thanany of us from--from circumstances--things that have been.” He paused,embarrassed.As she replied, she raised her finger and pointed to her forehead:--“I know. That is why I must go. I can tell you now, whilst the sun iscoming up; I may not be able again. I know that when the Count wills meI must go. I know that if he tells me to come in secret, I must come bywile; by any device to hoodwink--even Jonathan.” God saw the look thatshe turned on me as she spoke, and if there be indeed a Recording Angelthat look is noted to her everlasting honour. I could only clasp herhand. I could not speak; my emotion was too great for even the relief oftears. She went on:--“You men are brave and strong. You are strong in your numbers, for youcan defy that which would break down the human endurance of one who hadto guard alone. Besides, I may be of service, since you can hypnotise meand so learn that which even I myself do not know.” Dr. Van Helsing saidvery gravely:--“Madam Mina, you are, as always, most wise. You shall with us come; andtogether we shall do that which we go forth to achieve.” When he hadspoken, Mina’s long spell of silence made me look at her. She had fallenback on her pillow asleep; she did not even wake when I had pulled upthe blind and let in the sunlight which flooded the room. Van Helsingmotioned to me to come with him quietly. We went to his room, and withina minute Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris were with us also.He told them what Mina had said, and went on:--“In the morning we shall leave for Varna. We have now to deal with anew factor: Madam Mina. Oh, but her soul is true. It is to her an agonyto tell us so much as she has done; but it is most right, and we arewarned in time. There must be no chance lost, and in Varna we must beready to act the instant when that ship arrives.”“What shall we do exactly?” asked Mr. Morris laconically. The Professorpaused before replying:--“We shall at the first board that ship; then, when we have identifiedthe box, we shall place a branch of the wild rose on it. This we shallfasten, for when it is there none can emerge; so at least says thesuperstition. And to superstition must we trust at the first; it wasman’s faith in the early, and it have its root in faith still. Then,when we get the opportunity that we seek, when none are near to see, weshall open the box, and--and all will be well.”“I shall not wait for any opportunity,” said Morris. “When I see the boxI shall open it and destroy the monster, though there were a thousandmen looking on, and if I am to be wiped out for it the next moment!” Igrasped his hand instinctively and found it as firm as a piece of steel.I think he understood my look; I hope he did.“Good boy,” said Dr. Van Helsing. “Brave boy. Quincey is all man. Godbless him for it. My child, believe me none of us shall lag behind orpause from any fear. I do but say what we may do--what we must do. But,indeed, indeed we cannot say what we shall do. There are so many thingswhich may happen, and their ways and their ends are so various thatuntil the moment we may not say. We shall all be armed, in all ways; andwhen the time for the end has come, our effort shall not be lack. Nowlet us to-day put all our affairs in order. Let all things which touchon others dear to us, and who on us depend, be complete; for none of uscan tell what, or when, or how, the end may be. As for me, my ownaffairs are regulate; and as I have nothing else to do, I shall go makearrangements for the travel. I shall have all tickets and so forth forour journey.”There was nothing further to be said, and we parted. I shall now settleup all my affairs of earth, and be ready for whatever may come....*       *       *       *       *_Later._--It is all done; my will is made, and all complete. Mina if shesurvive is my sole heir. If it should not be so, then the others whohave been so good to us shall have remainder.It is now drawing towards the sunset; Mina’s uneasiness calls myattention to it. I am sure that there is something on her mind which thetime of exact sunset will reveal. These occasions are becoming harrowingtimes for us all, for each sunrise and sunset opens up some newdanger--some new pain, which, however, may in God’s will be means to agood end. I write all these things in the diary since my darling mustnot hear them now; but if it may be that she can see them again, theyshall be ready.She is calling to me.CHAPTER XXVDR. SEWARD’S DIARY_11 October, Evening._--Jonathan Harker has asked me to note this, as hesays he is hardly equal to the task, and he wants an exact record kept.I think that none of us were surprised when we were asked to see Mrs.Harker a little before the time of sunset. We have of late come tounderstand that sunrise and sunset are to her times of peculiar freedom;when her old self can be manifest without any controlling force subduingor restraining her, or inciting her to action. This mood or conditionbegins some half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset, and laststill either the sun is high, or whilst the clouds are still aglow withthe rays streaming above the horizon. At first there is a sort ofnegative condition, as if some tie were loosened, and then the absolutefreedom quickly follows; when, however, the freedom ceases thechange-back or relapse comes quickly, preceded only by a spell ofwarning silence.To-night, when we met, she was somewhat constrained, and bore all thesigns of an internal struggle. I put it down myself to her making aviolent effort at the earliest instant she could do so. A very fewminutes, however, gave her complete control of herself; then, motioningher husband to sit beside her on the sofa where she was half reclining,she made the rest of us bring chairs up close. Taking her husband’s handin hers began:--“We are all here together in freedom, for perhaps the last time! I know,dear; I know that you will always be with me to the end.” This was toher husband whose hand had, as we could see, tightened upon hers. “Inthe morning we go out upon our task, and God alone knows what may be instore for any of us. You are going to be so good to me as to take mewith you. I know that all that brave earnest men can do for a poor weakwoman, whose soul perhaps is lost--no, no, not yet, but is at any rateat stake--you will do. But you must remember that I am not as you are.There is a poison in my blood, in my soul, which may destroy me; whichmust destroy me, unless some relief comes to us. Oh, my friends, youknow as well as I do, that my soul is at stake; and though I know thereis one way out for me, you must not and I must not take it!” She lookedappealingly to us all in turn, beginning and ending with her husband.“What is that way?” asked Van Helsing in a hoarse voice. “What is thatway, which we must not--may not--take?”“That I may die now, either by my own hand or that of another, beforethe greater evil is entirely wrought. I know, and you know, that were Ionce dead you could and would set free my immortal spirit, even as youdid my poor Lucy’s. Were death, or the fear of death, the only thingthat stood in the way I would not shrink to die here, now, amidst thefriends who love me. But death is not all. I cannot believe that to diein such a case, when there is hope before us and a bitter task to bedone, is God’s will. Therefore, I, on my part, give up here thecertainty of eternal rest, and go out into the dark where may be theblackest things that the world or the nether world holds!” We were allsilent, for we knew instinctively that this was only a prelude. Thefaces of the others were set and Harker’s grew ashen grey; perhaps heguessed better than any of us what was coming. She continued:--“This is what I can give into the hotch-pot.” I could not but note thequaint legal phrase which she used in such a place, and with allseriousness. “What will each of you give? Your lives I know,” she wenton quickly, “that is easy for brave men. Your lives are God’s, and youcan give them back to Him; but what will you give to me?” She lookedagain questioningly, but this time avoided her husband’s face. Quinceyseemed to understand; he nodded, and her face lit up. “Then I shall tellyou plainly what I want, for there must be no doubtful matter in thisconnection between us now. You must promise me, one and all--even you,my beloved husband--that, should the time come, you will kill me.”“What is that time?” The voice was Quincey’s, but it was low andstrained.“When you shall be convinced that I am so changed that it is better thatI die than I may live. When I am thus dead in the flesh, then you will,without a moment’s delay, drive a stake through me and cut off my head;or do whatever else may be wanting to give me rest!”Quincey was the first to rise after the pause. He knelt down before herand taking her hand in his said solemnly:--“I’m only a rough fellow, who hasn’t, perhaps, lived as a man should towin such a distinction, but I swear to you by all that I hold sacred anddear that, should the time ever come, I shall not flinch from the dutythat you have set us. And I promise you, too, that I shall make allcertain, for if I am only doubtful I shall take it that the time hascome!”“My true friend!” was all she could say amid her fast-falling tears, as,bending over, she kissed his hand.“I swear the same, my dear Madam Mina!” said Van Helsing.“And I!” said Lord Godalming, each of them in turn kneeling to her totake the oath. I followed, myself. Then her husband turned to herwan-eyed and with a greenish pallor which subdued the snowy whiteness ofhis hair, and asked:--“And must I, too, make such a promise, oh, my wife?”“You too, my dearest,” she said, with infinite yearning of pity in hervoice and eyes. “You must not shrink. You are nearest and dearest andall the world to me; our souls are knit into one, for all life and alltime. Think, dear, that there have been times when brave men have killedtheir wives and their womenkind, to keep them from falling into thehands of the enemy. Their hands did not falter any the more becausethose that they loved implored them to slay them. It is men’s dutytowards those whom they love, in such times of sore trial! And oh, mydear, if it is to be that I must meet death at any hand, let it be atthe hand of him that loves me best. Dr. Van Helsing, I have notforgotten your mercy in poor Lucy’s case to him who loved”--she stoppedwith a flying blush, and changed her phrase--“to him who had best rightto give her peace. If that time shall come again, I look to you to makeit a happy memory of my husband’s life that it was his loving hand whichset me free from the awful thrall upon me.”“Again I swear!” came the Professor’s resonant voice. Mrs. Harkersmiled, positively smiled, as with a sigh of relief she leaned back andsaid:--“And now one word of warning, a warning which you must never forget:this time, if it ever come, may come quickly and unexpectedly, and insuch case you must lose no time in using your opportunity. At such atime I myself might be--nay! if the time ever comes, _shall be_--leaguedwith your enemy against you.”“One more request;” she became very solemn as she said this, “it is notvital and necessary like the other, but I want you to do one thing forme, if you will.” We all acquiesced, but no one spoke; there was no needto speak:--“I want you to read the Burial Service.” She was interrupted by a deepgroan from her husband; taking his hand in hers, she held it over herheart, and continued: “You must read it over me some day. Whatever maybe the issue of all this fearful state of things, it will be a sweetthought to all or some of us. You, my dearest, will I hope read it, forthen it will be in your voice in my memory for ever--come what may!”“But oh, my dear one,” he pleaded, “death is afar off from you.”“Nay,” she said, holding up a warning hand. “I am deeper in death atthis moment than if the weight of an earthly grave lay heavy upon me!”“Oh, my wife, must I read it?” he said, before he began.“It would comfort me, my husband!” was all she said; and he began toread when she had got the book ready.“How can I--how could any one--tell of that strange scene, itssolemnity, its gloom, its sadness, its horror; and, withal, itssweetness. Even a sceptic, who can see nothing but a travesty of bittertruth in anything holy or emotional, would have been melted to the hearthad he seen that little group of loving and devoted friends kneelinground that stricken and sorrowing lady; or heard the tender passion ofher husband’s voice, as in tones so broken with emotion that often hehad to pause, he read the simple and beautiful service from the Burialof the Dead. I--I cannot go on--words--and--v-voice--f-fail m-me!”*       *       *       *       *She was right in her instinct. Strange as it all was, bizarre as it mayhereafter seem even to us who felt its potent influence at the time, itcomforted us much; and the silence, which showed Mrs. Harker’s comingrelapse from her freedom of soul, did not seem so full of despair to anyof us as we had dreaded._Jonathan Harker’s Journal.__15 October, Varna._--We left Charing Cross on the morning of the 12th,got to Paris the same night, and took the places secured for us in theOrient Express. We travelled night and day, arriving here at about fiveo’clock. Lord Godalming went to the Consulate to see if any telegram hadarrived for him, whilst the rest of us came on to this hotel--“theOdessus.” The journey may have had incidents; I was, however, too eagerto get on, to care for them. Until the _Czarina Catherine_ comes intoport there will be no interest for me in anything in the wide world.Thank God! Mina is well, and looks to be getting stronger; her colour iscoming back. She sleeps a great deal; throughout the journey she sleptnearly all the time. Before sunrise and sunset, however, she is verywakeful and alert; and it has become a habit for Van Helsing tohypnotise her at such times. At first, some effort was needed, and hehad to make many passes; but now, she seems to yield at once, as if byhabit, and scarcely any action is needed. He seems to have power atthese particular moments to simply will, and her thoughts obey him. Healways asks her what she can see and hear. She answers to the first:--“Nothing; all is dark.” And to the second:--“I can hear the waves lapping against the ship, and the water rushingby. Canvas and cordage strain and masts and yards creak. The wind ishigh--I can hear it in the shrouds, and the bow throws back the foam.”It is evident that the _Czarina Catherine_ is still at sea, hastening onher way to Varna. Lord Godalming has just returned. He had fourtelegrams, one each day since we started, and all to the same effect:that the _Czarina Catherine_ had not been reported to Lloyd’s fromanywhere. He had arranged before leaving London that his agent shouldsend him every day a telegram saying if the ship had been reported. Hewas to have a message even if she were not reported, so that he might besure that there was a watch being kept at the other end of the wire.We had dinner and went to bed early. To-morrow we are to see theVice-Consul, and to arrange, if we can, about getting on board the shipas soon as she arrives. Van Helsing says that our chance will be to geton the boat between sunrise and sunset. The Count, even if he takes theform of a bat, cannot cross the running water of his own volition, andso cannot leave the ship. As he dare not change to man’s form withoutsuspicion--which he evidently wishes to avoid--he must remain in thebox. If, then, we can come on board after sunrise, he is at our mercy;for we can open the box and make sure of him, as we did of poor Lucy,before he wakes. What mercy he shall get from us will not count formuch. We think that we shall not have much trouble with officials or theseamen. Thank God! this is the country where bribery can do anything,and we are well supplied with money. We have only to make sure that theship cannot come into port between sunset and sunrise without our beingwarned, and we shall be safe. Judge Moneybag will settle this case, Ithink!*       *       *       *       *_16 October._--Mina’s report still the same: lapping waves and rushingwater, darkness and favouring winds. We are evidently in good time, andwhen we hear of the _Czarina Catherine_ we shall be ready. As she mustpass the Dardanelles we are sure to have some report.*       *       *       *       *_17 October._--Everything is pretty well fixed now, I think, to welcomethe Count on his return from his tour. Godalming told the shippers thathe fancied that the box sent aboard might contain something stolen froma friend of his, and got a half consent that he might open it at his ownrisk. The owner gave him a paper telling the Captain to give him everyfacility in doing whatever he chose on board the ship, and also asimilar authorisation to his agent at Varna. We have seen the agent, whowas much impressed with Godalming’s kindly manner to him, and we are allsatisfied that whatever he can do to aid our wishes will be done. Wehave already arranged what to do in case we get the box open. If theCount is there, Van Helsing and Seward will cut off his head at once anddrive a stake through his heart. Morris and Godalming and I shallprevent interference, even if we have to use the arms which we shallhave ready. The Professor says that if we can so treat the Count’s body,it will soon after fall into dust. In such case there would be noevidence against us, in case any suspicion of murder were aroused. Buteven if it were not, we should stand or fall by our act, and perhapssome day this very script may be evidence to come between some of us anda rope. For myself, I should take the chance only too thankfully if itwere to come. We mean to leave no stone unturned to carry out ourintent. We have arranged with certain officials that the instant the_Czarina Catherine_ is seen, we are to be informed by a specialmessenger.*       *       *       *       *_24 October._--A whole week of waiting. Daily telegrams to Godalming,but only the same story: “Not yet reported.” Mina’s morning and eveninghypnotic answer is unvaried: lapping waves, rushing water, and creakingmasts._Telegram, October 24th.__Rufus Smith, Lloyd’s, London, to Lord Godalming, care of H. B. M.Vice-Consul, Varna._“_Czarina Catherine_ reported this morning from Dardanelles.”_Dr. Seward’s Diary.__25 October._--How I miss my phonograph! To write diary with a pen isirksome to me; but Van Helsing says I must. We were all wild withexcitement yesterday when Godalming got his telegram from Lloyd’s. Iknow now what men feel in battle when the call to action is heard. Mrs.Harker, alone of our party, did not show any signs of emotion. Afterall, it is not strange that she did not; for we took special care not tolet her know anything about it, and we all tried not to show anyexcitement when we were in her presence. In old days she would, I amsure, have noticed, no matter how we might have tried to conceal it; butin this way she is greatly changed during the past three weeks. Thelethargy grows upon her, and though she seems strong and well, and isgetting back some of her colour, Van Helsing and I are not satisfied. Wetalk of her often; we have not, however, said a word to the others. Itwould break poor Harker’s heart--certainly his nerve--if he knew that wehad even a suspicion on the subject. Van Helsing examines, he tells me,her teeth very carefully, whilst she is in the hypnotic condition, forhe says that so long as they do not begin to sharpen there is no activedanger of a change in her. If this change should come, it would benecessary to take steps!... We both know what those steps would have tobe, though we do not mention our thoughts to each other. We shouldneither of us shrink from the task--awful though it be to contemplate.“Euthanasia” is an excellent and a comforting word! I am grateful towhoever invented it.It is only about 24 hours’ sail from the Dardanelles to here, at therate the _Czarina Catherine_ has come from London. She should thereforearrive some time in the morning; but as she cannot possibly get inbefore then, we are all about to retire early. We shall get up at oneo’clock, so as to be ready.*       *       *       *       *_25 October, Noon_.--No news yet of the ship’s arrival. Mrs. Harker’shypnotic report this morning was the same as usual, so it is possiblethat we may get news at any moment. We men are all in a fever ofexcitement, except Harker, who is calm; his hands are cold as ice, andan hour ago I found him whetting the edge of the great Ghoorka knifewhich he now always carries with him. It will be a bad lookout for theCount if the edge of that “Kukri” ever touches his throat, driven bythat stern, ice-cold hand!Van Helsing and I were a little alarmed about Mrs. Harker to-day. Aboutnoon she got into a sort of lethargy which we did not like; although wekept silence to the others, we were neither of us happy about it. Shehad been restless all the morning, so that we were at first glad to knowthat she was sleeping. When, however, her husband mentioned casuallythat she was sleeping so soundly that he could not wake her, we went toher room to see for ourselves. She was breathing naturally and looked sowell and peaceful that we agreed that the sleep was better for her thananything else. Poor girl, she has so much to forget that it is no wonderthat sleep, if it brings oblivion to her, does her good.*       *       *       *       *_Later._--Our opinion was justified, for when after a refreshing sleepof some hours she woke up, she seemed brighter and better than she hadbeen for days. At sunset she made the usual hypnotic report. Wherever hemay be in the Black Sea, the Count is hurrying to his destination. Tohis doom, I trust!*       *       *       *       *_26 October._--Another day and no tidings of the _Czarina Catherine_.She ought to be here by now. That she is still journeying _somewhere_ isapparent, for Mrs. Harker’s hypnotic report at sunrise was still thesame. It is possible that the vessel may be lying by, at times, for fog;some of the steamers which came in last evening reported patches of fogboth to north and south of the port. We must continue our watching, asthe ship may now be signalled any moment.*       *       *       *       *_27 October, Noon._--Most strange; no news yet of the ship we wait for.Mrs. Harker reported last night and this morning as usual: “lappingwaves and rushing water,” though she added that “the waves were veryfaint.” The telegrams from London have been the same: “no furtherreport.” Van Helsing is terribly anxious, and told me just now that hefears the Count is escaping us. He added significantly:--“I did not like that lethargy of Madam Mina’s. Souls and memories can dostrange things during trance.” I was about to ask him more, but Harkerjust then came in, and he held up a warning hand. We must try to-nightat sunset to make her speak more fully when in her hypnotic state.*       *       *       *       *_28 October._--Telegram. _Rufus Smith, London, to Lord Godalming,care H. B. M. Vice Consul, Varna._“_Czarina Catherine_ reported entering Galatz at one o’clockto-day.”_Dr. Seward’s Diary.__28 October._--When the telegram came announcing the arrival in Galatz Ido not think it was such a shock to any of us as might have beenexpected. True, we did not know whence, or how, or when, the bolt wouldcome; but I think we all expected that something strange would happen.The delay of arrival at Varna made us individually satisfied that thingswould not be just as we had expected; we only waited to learn where thechange would occur. None the less, however, was it a surprise. I supposethat nature works on such a hopeful basis that we believe againstourselves that things will be as they ought to be, not as we should knowthat they will be. Transcendentalism is a beacon to the angels, even ifit be a will-o’-the-wisp to man. It was an odd experience and we alltook it differently. Van Helsing raised his hand over his head for amoment, as though in remonstrance with the Almighty; but he said not aword, and in a few seconds stood up with his face sternly set. LordGodalming grew very pale, and sat breathing heavily. I was myself halfstunned and looked in wonder at one after another. Quincey Morristightened his belt with that quick movement which I knew so well; in ourold wandering days it meant “action.” Mrs. Harker grew ghastly white, sothat the scar on her forehead seemed to burn, but she folded her handsmeekly and looked up in prayer. Harker smiled--actually smiled--thedark, bitter smile of one who is without hope; but at the same time hisaction belied his words, for his hands instinctively sought the hilt ofthe great Kukri knife and rested there. “When does the next train startfor Galatz?” said Van Helsing to us generally.“At 6:30 to-morrow morning!” We all started, for the answer came fromMrs. Harker.“How on earth do you know?” said Art.“You forget--or perhaps you do not know, though Jonathan does and sodoes Dr. Van Helsing--that I am the train fiend. At home in Exeter Ialways used to make up the time-tables, so as to be helpful to myhusband. I found it so useful sometimes, that I always make a study ofthe time-tables now. I knew that if anything were to take us to CastleDracula we should go by Galatz, or at any rate through Bucharest, so Ilearned the times very carefully. Unhappily there are not many to learn,as the only train to-morrow leaves as I say.”“Wonderful woman!” murmured the Professor.“Can’t we get a special?” asked Lord Godalming. Van Helsing shook hishead: “I fear not. This land is very different from yours or mine; evenif we did have a special, it would probably not arrive as soon as ourregular train. Moreover, we have something to prepare. We must think.Now let us organize. You, friend Arthur, go to the train and get thetickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go in the morning. Doyou, friend Jonathan, go to the agent of the ship and get from himletters to the agent in Galatz, with authority to make search the shipjust as it was here. Morris Quincey, you see the Vice-Consul, and gethis aid with his fellow in Galatz and all he can do to make our waysmooth, so that no times be lost when over the Danube. John will staywith Madam Mina and me, and we shall consult. For so if time be long youmay be delayed; and it will not matter when the sun set, since I am herewith Madam to make report.”“And I,” said Mrs. Harker brightly, and more like her old self than shehad been for many a long day, “shall try to be of use in all ways, andshall think and write for you as I used to do. Something is shiftingfrom me in some strange way, and I feel freer than I have been of late!”The three younger men looked happier at the moment as they seemed torealise the significance of her words; but Van Helsing and I, turning toeach other, met each a grave and troubled glance. We said nothing at thetime, however.When the three men had gone out to their tasks Van Helsing asked Mrs.Harker to look up the copy of the diaries and find him the part ofHarker’s journal at the Castle. She went away to get it; when the doorwas shut upon her he said to me:--“We mean the same! speak out!”“There is some change. It is a hope that makes me sick, for it maydeceive us.”“Quite so. Do you know why I asked her to get the manuscript?”“No!” said I, “unless it was to get an opportunity of seeing me alone.”“You are in part right, friend John, but only in part. I want to tellyou something. And oh, my friend, I am taking a great--a terrible--risk;but I believe it is right. In the moment when Madam Mina said thosewords that arrest both our understanding, an inspiration came to me. Inthe trance of three days ago the Count sent her his spirit to read hermind; or more like he took her to see him in his earth-box in the shipwith water rushing, just as it go free at rise and set of sun. He learnthen that we are here; for she have more to tell in her open life witheyes to see and ears to hear than he, shut, as he is, in his coffin-box.Now he make his most effort to escape us. At present he want her not.“He is sure with his so great knowledge that she will come at his call;but he cut her off--take her, as he can do, out of his own power, thatso she come not to him. Ah! there I have hope that our man-brains thathave been of man so long and that have not lost the grace of God, willcome higher than his child-brain that lie in his tomb for centuries,that grow not yet to our stature, and that do only work selfish andtherefore small. Here comes Madam Mina; not a word to her of her trance!She know it not; and it would overwhelm her and make despair just whenwe want all her hope, all her courage; when most we want all her greatbrain which is trained like man’s brain, but is of sweet woman and havea special power which the Count give her, and which he may not take awayaltogether--though he think not so. Hush! let me speak, and you shalllearn. Oh, John, my friend, we are in awful straits. I fear, as I neverfeared before. We can only trust the good God. Silence! here she comes!”I thought that the Professor was going to break down and have hysterics,just as he had when Lucy died, but with a great effort he controlledhimself and was at perfect nervous poise when Mrs. Harker tripped intothe room, bright and happy-looking and, in the doing of work, seeminglyforgetful of her misery. As she came in, she handed a number of sheetsof typewriting to Van Helsing. He looked over them gravely, his facebrightening up as he read. Then holding the pages between his finger andthumb he said:--“Friend John, to you with so much of experience already--and you, too,dear Madam Mina, that are young--here is a lesson: do not fear ever tothink. A half-thought has been buzzing often in my brain, but I fear tolet him loose his wings. Here now, with more knowledge, I go back towhere that half-thought come from and I find that he be no half-thoughtat all; that be a whole thought, though so young that he is not yetstrong to use his little wings. Nay, like the “Ugly Duck” of my friendHans Andersen, he be no duck-thought at all, but a big swan-thought thatsail nobly on big wings, when the time come for him to try them. See Iread here what Jonathan have written:--“That other of his race who, in a later age, again and again, broughthis forces over The Great River into Turkey Land; who, when he wasbeaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had to comealone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered,since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph.”“What does this tell us? Not much? no! The Count’s child-thought seenothing; therefore he speak so free. Your man-thought see nothing; myman-thought see nothing, till just now. No! But there comes another wordfrom some one who speak without thought because she, too, know not whatit mean--what it _might_ mean. Just as there are elements which rest,yet when in nature’s course they move on their way and they touch--thenpouf! and there comes a flash of light, heaven wide, that blind and killand destroy some; but that show up all earth below for leagues andleagues. Is it not so? Well, I shall explain. To begin, have you everstudy the philosophy of crime? ‘Yes’ and ‘No.’ You, John, yes; for it isa study of insanity. You, no, Madam Mina; for crime touch you not--notbut once. Still, your mind works true, and argues not _a particulari aduniversale_. There is this peculiarity in criminals. It is so constant,in all countries and at all times, that even police, who know not muchfrom philosophy, come to know it empirically, that _it is_. That is tobe empiric. The criminal always work at one crime--that is the truecriminal who seems predestinate to crime, and who will of none other.This criminal has not full man-brain. He is clever and cunning andresourceful; but he be not of man-stature as to brain. He be ofchild-brain in much. Now this criminal of ours is predestinate to crimealso; he, too, have child-brain, and it is of the child to do what hehave done. The little bird, the little fish, the little animal learn notby principle, but empirically; and when he learn to do, then there is tohim the ground to start from to do more. ‘_Dos pou sto_,’ saidArchimedes. ‘Give me a fulcrum, and I shall move the world!’ To do once,is the fulcrum whereby child-brain become man-brain; and until he havethe purpose to do more, he continue to do the same again every time,just as he have done before! Oh, my dear, I see that your eyes areopened, and that to you the lightning flash show all the leagues,” forMrs. Harker began to clap her hands and her eyes sparkled. He went on:--“Now you shall speak. Tell us two dry men of science what you see withthose so bright eyes.” He took her hand and held it whilst she spoke.His finger and thumb closed on her pulse, as I thought instinctively andunconsciously, as she spoke:--“The Count is a criminal and of criminal type. Nordau and Lombroso wouldso classify him, and _quâ_ criminal he is of imperfectly formed mind.Thus, in a difficulty he has to seek resource in habit. His past is aclue, and the one page of it that we know--and that from his ownlips--tells that once before, when in what Mr. Morris would call a‘tight place,’ he went back to his own country from the land he hadtried to invade, and thence, without losing purpose, prepared himselffor a new effort. He came again better equipped for his work; and won.So he came to London to invade a new land. He was beaten, and when allhope of success was lost, and his existence in danger, he fled back overthe sea to his home; just as formerly he had fled back over the Danubefrom Turkey Land.”“Good, good! oh, you so clever lady!” said Van Helsing,enthusiastically, as he stooped and kissed her hand. A moment later hesaid to me, as calmly as though we had been having a sick-roomconsultation:--“Seventy-two only; and in all this excitement. I have hope.” Turning toher again, he said with keen expectation:--“But go on. Go on! there is more to tell if you will. Be not afraid;John and I know. I do in any case, and shall tell you if you are right.Speak, without fear!”“I will try to; but you will forgive me if I seem egotistical.”“Nay! fear not, you must be egotist, for it is of you that we think.”“Then, as he is criminal he is selfish; and as his intellect is smalland his action is based on selfishness, he confines himself to onepurpose. That purpose is remorseless. As he fled back over the Danube,leaving his forces to be cut to pieces, so now he is intent on beingsafe, careless of all. So his own selfishness frees my soul somewhatfrom the terrible power which he acquired over me on that dreadfulnight. I felt it! Oh, I felt it! Thank God, for His great mercy! My soulis freer than it has been since that awful hour; and all that haunts meis a fear lest in some trance or dream he may have used my knowledge forhis ends.” The Professor stood up:--“He has so used your mind; and by it he has left us here in Varna,whilst the ship that carried him rushed through enveloping fog up toGalatz, where, doubtless, he had made preparation for escaping from us.But his child-mind only saw so far; and it may be that, as ever is inGod’s Providence, the very thing that the evil-doer most reckoned on forhis selfish good, turns out to be his chiefest harm. The hunter is takenin his own snare, as the great Psalmist says. For now that he think heis free from every trace of us all, and that he has escaped us with somany hours to him, then his selfish child-brain will whisper him tosleep. He think, too, that as he cut himself off from knowing your mind,there can be no knowledge of him to you; there is where he fail! Thatterrible baptism of blood which he give you makes you free to go to himin spirit, as you have as yet done in your times of freedom, when thesun rise and set. At such times you go by my volition and not by his;and this power to good of you and others, as you have won from yoursuffering at his hands. This is now all the more precious that he knowit not, and to guard himself have even cut himself off from hisknowledge of our where. We, however, are not selfish, and we believethat God is with us through all this blackness, and these many darkhours. We shall follow him; and we shall not flinch; even if we perilourselves that we become like him. Friend John, this has been a greathour; and it have done much to advance us on our way. You must be scribeand write him all down, so that when the others return from their workyou can give it to them; then they shall know as we do.”And so I have written it whilst we wait their return, and Mrs. Harkerhas written with her typewriter all since she brought the MS. to us.CHAPTER XXVIDR. SEWARD’S DIARY_29 October._--This is written in the train from Varna to Galatz. Lastnight we all assembled a little before the time of sunset. Each of ushad done his work as well as he could; so far as thought, and endeavour,and opportunity go, we are prepared for the whole of our journey, andfor our work when we get to Galatz. When the usual time came round Mrs.Harker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort; and after a longer andmore serious effort on the part of Van Helsing than has been usuallynecessary, she sank into the trance. Usually she speaks on a hint; butthis time the Professor had to ask her questions, and to ask them prettyresolutely, before we could learn anything; at last her answer came:--“I can see nothing; we are still; there are no waves lapping, but only asteady swirl of water softly running against the hawser. I can hearmen’s voices calling, near and far, and the roll and creak of oars inthe rowlocks. A gun is fired somewhere; the echo of it seems far away.There is tramping of feet overhead, and ropes and chains are draggedalong. What is this? There is a gleam of light; I can feel the airblowing upon me.”Here she stopped. She had risen, as if impulsively, from where she layon the sofa, and raised both her hands, palms upwards, as if lifting aweight. Van Helsing and I looked at each other with understanding.Quincey raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at her intently, whilstHarker’s hand instinctively closed round the hilt of his Kukri. Therewas a long pause. We all knew that the time when she could speak waspassing; but we felt that it was useless to say anything. Suddenly shesat up, and, as she opened her eyes, said sweetly:--“Would none of you like a cup of tea? You must all be so tired!” Wecould only make her happy, and so acquiesced. She bustled off to gettea; when she had gone Van Helsing said:--“You see, my friends. _He_ is close to land: he has left hisearth-chest. But he has yet to get on shore. In the night he may liehidden somewhere; but if he be not carried on shore, or if the ship donot touch it, he cannot achieve the land. In such case he can, if it bein the night, change his form and can jump or fly on shore, as he didat Whitby. But if the day come before he get on shore, then, unless hebe carried he cannot escape. And if he be carried, then the customs menmay discover what the box contain. Thus, in fine, if he escape not onshore to-night, or before dawn, there will be the whole day lost to him.We may then arrive in time; for if he escape not at night we shall comeon him in daytime, boxed up and at our mercy; for he dare not be histrue self, awake and visible, lest he be discovered.”There was no more to be said, so we waited in patience until the dawn;at which time we might learn more from Mrs. Harker.Early this morning we listened, with breathless anxiety, for herresponse in her trance. The hypnotic stage was even longer in comingthan before; and when it came the time remaining until full sunrise wasso short that we began to despair. Van Helsing seemed to throw his wholesoul into the effort; at last, in obedience to his will she madereply:--“All is dark. I hear lapping water, level with me, and some creaking asof wood on wood.” She paused, and the red sun shot up. We must wait tillto-night.And so it is that we are travelling towards Galatz in an agony ofexpectation. We are due to arrive between two and three in the morning;but already, at Bucharest, we are three hours late, so we cannotpossibly get in till well after sun-up. Thus we shall have two morehypnotic messages from Mrs. Harker; either or both may possibly throwmore light on what is happening.*       *       *       *       *_Later._--Sunset has come and gone. Fortunately it came at a time whenthere was no distraction; for had it occurred whilst we were at astation, we might not have secured the necessary calm and isolation.Mrs. Harker yielded to the hypnotic influence even less readily thanthis morning. I am in fear that her power of reading the Count’ssensations may die away, just when we want it most. It seems to me thather imagination is beginning to work. Whilst she has been in the trancehitherto she has confined herself to the simplest of facts. If this goeson it may ultimately mislead us. If I thought that the Count’s powerover her would die away equally with her power of knowledge it would bea happy thought; but I am afraid that it may not be so. When she didspeak, her words were enigmatical:--“Something is going out; I can feel it pass me like a cold wind. I canhear, far off, confused sounds--as of men talking in strange tongues,fierce-falling water, and the howling of wolves.” She stopped and ashudder ran through her, increasing in intensity for a few seconds,till, at the end, she shook as though in a palsy. She said no more, evenin answer to the Professor’s imperative questioning. When she woke fromthe trance, she was cold, and exhausted, and languid; but her mind wasall alert. She could not remember anything, but asked what she had said;when she was told, she pondered over it deeply for a long time and insilence.*       *       *       *       *_30 October, 7 a. m._--We are near Galatz now, and I may not have timeto write later. Sunrise this morning was anxiously looked for by us all.Knowing of the increasing difficulty of procuring the hypnotic trance,Van Helsing began his passes earlier than usual. They produced noeffect, however, until the regular time, when she yielded with a stillgreater difficulty, only a minute before the sun rose. The Professorlost no time in his questioning; her answer came with equal quickness:--“All is dark. I hear water swirling by, level with my ears, and thecreaking of wood on wood. Cattle low far off. There is another sound, aqueer one like----” She stopped and grew white, and whiter still.“Go on; go on! Speak, I command you!” said Van Helsing in an agonisedvoice. At the same time there was despair in his eyes, for the risen sunwas reddening even Mrs. Harker’s pale face. She opened her eyes, and weall started as she said, sweetly and seemingly with the utmostunconcern:--“Oh, Professor, why ask me to do what you know I can’t? I don’t rememberanything.” Then, seeing the look of amazement on our faces, she said,turning from one to the other with a troubled look:--“What have I said? What have I done? I know nothing, only that I waslying here, half asleep, and heard you say ‘go on! speak, I command you!’It seemed so funny to hear you order me about, as if I were a badchild!”“Oh, Madam Mina,” he said, sadly, “it is proof, if proof be needed, ofhow I love and honour you, when a word for your good, spoken moreearnest than ever, can seem so strange because it is to order her whom Iam proud to obey!”The whistles are sounding; we are nearing Galatz. We are on fire withanxiety and eagerness._Mina Harker’s Journal.__30 October._--Mr. Morris took me to the hotel where our rooms had beenordered by telegraph, he being the one who could best be spared, sincehe does not speak any foreign language. The forces were distributedmuch as they had been at Varna, except that Lord Godalming went to theVice-Consul, as his rank might serve as an immediate guarantee of somesort to the official, we being in extreme hurry. Jonathan and the twodoctors went to the shipping agent to learn particulars of the arrivalof the _Czarina Catherine_.*       *       *       *       *_Later._--Lord Godalming has returned. The Consul is away, and theVice-Consul sick; so the routine work has been attended to by a clerk.He was very obliging, and offered to do anything in his power._Jonathan Harker’s Journal.__30 October._--At nine o’clock Dr. Van Helsing, Dr. Seward, and I calledon Messrs. Mackenzie & Steinkoff, the agents of the London firm ofHapgood. They had received a wire from London, in answer to LordGodalming’s telegraphed request, asking us to show them any civility intheir power. They were more than kind and courteous, and took us at onceon board the _Czarina Catherine_, which lay at anchor out in the riverharbour. There we saw the Captain, Donelson by name, who told us of hisvoyage. He said that in all his life he had never had so favourable arun.“Man!” he said, “but it made us afeard, for we expeckit that we shouldhave to pay for it wi’ some rare piece o’ ill luck, so as to keep up theaverage. It’s no canny to run frae London to the Black Sea wi’ a windahint ye, as though the Deil himself were blawin’ on yer sail for hisain purpose. An’ a’ the time we could no speer a thing. Gin we were nigha ship, or a port, or a headland, a fog fell on us and travelled wi’ us,till when after it had lifted and we looked out, the deil a thing couldwe see. We ran by Gibraltar wi’oot bein’ able to signal; an’ till wecame to the Dardanelles and had to wait to get our permit to pass, wenever were within hail o’ aught. At first I inclined to slack off sailand beat about till the fog was lifted; but whiles, I thocht that if theDeil was minded to get us into the Black Sea quick, he was like to do itwhether we would or no. If we had a quick voyage it would be no to ourmiscredit wi’ the owners, or no hurt to our traffic; an’ the Old Mon whohad served his ain purpose wad be decently grateful to us for nohinderin’ him.” This mixture of simplicity and cunning, of superstitionand commercial reasoning, aroused Van Helsing, who said:--“Mine friend, that Devil is more clever than he is thought by some; andhe know when he meet his match!” The skipper was not displeased with thecompliment, and went on:--“When we got past the Bosphorus the men began to grumble; some o’ them,the Roumanians, came and asked me to heave overboard a big box which hadbeen put on board by a queer lookin’ old man just before we had startedfrae London. I had seen them speer at the fellow, and put out their twafingers when they saw him, to guard against the evil eye. Man! but thesupersteetion of foreigners is pairfectly rideeculous! I sent them aboottheir business pretty quick; but as just after a fog closed in on us Ifelt a wee bit as they did anent something, though I wouldn’t say it wasagin the big box. Well, on we went, and as the fog didn’t let up forfive days I joost let the wind carry us; for if the Deil wanted to getsomewheres--well, he would fetch it up a’reet. An’ if he didn’t, well,we’d keep a sharp lookout anyhow. Sure eneuch, we had a fair way anddeep water all the time; and two days ago, when the mornin’ sun camethrough the fog, we found ourselves just in the river opposite Galatz.The Roumanians were wild, and wanted me right or wrong to take out thebox and fling it in the river. I had to argy wi’ them aboot it wi’ ahandspike; an’ when the last o’ them rose off the deck wi’ his head inhis hand, I had convinced them that, evil eye or no evil eye, theproperty and the trust of my owners were better in my hands than in theriver Danube. They had, mind ye, taken the box on the deck ready tofling in, and as it was marked Galatz _via_ Varna, I thocht I’d let itlie till we discharged in the port an’ get rid o’t althegither. Wedidn’t do much clearin’ that day, an’ had to remain the nicht at anchor;but in the mornin’, braw an’ airly, an hour before sun-up, a man cameaboard wi’ an order, written to him from England, to receive a boxmarked for one Count Dracula. Sure eneuch the matter was one ready tohis hand. He had his papers a’ reet, an’ glad I was to be rid o’ thedam’ thing, for I was beginnin’ masel’ to feel uneasy at it. If the Deildid have any luggage aboord the ship, I’m thinkin’ it was nane itherthan that same!”“What was the name of the man who took it?” asked Dr. Van Helsing withrestrained eagerness.“I’ll be tellin’ ye quick!” he answered, and, stepping down to hiscabin, produced a receipt signed “Immanuel Hildesheim.” Burgen-strasse16 was the address. We found out that this was all the Captain knew; sowith thanks we came away.We found Hildesheim in his office, a Hebrew of rather the AdelphiTheatre type, with a nose like a sheep, and a fez. His arguments werepointed with specie--we doing the punctuation--and with a littlebargaining he told us what he knew. This turned out to be simple butimportant. He had received a letter from Mr. de Ville of London, tellinghim to receive, if possible before sunrise so as to avoid customs, a boxwhich would arrive at Galatz in the _Czarina Catherine_. This he was togive in charge to a certain Petrof Skinsky, who dealt with the Slovakswho traded down the river to the port. He had been paid for his work byan English bank note, which had been duly cashed for gold at the DanubeInternational Bank. When Skinsky had come to him, he had taken him tothe ship and handed over the box, so as to save porterage. That was allhe knew.We then sought for Skinsky, but were unable to find him. One of hisneighbours, who did not seem to bear him any affection, said that he hadgone away two days before, no one knew whither. This was corroborated byhis landlord, who had received by messenger the key of the housetogether with the rent due, in English money. This had been between tenand eleven o’clock last night. We were at a standstill again.Whilst we were talking one came running and breathlessly gasped out thatthe body of Skinsky had been found inside the wall of the churchyard ofSt. Peter, and that the throat had been torn open as if by some wildanimal. Those we had been speaking with ran off to see the horror, thewomen crying out “This is the work of a Slovak!” We hurried away lest weshould have been in some way drawn into the affair, and so detained.As we came home we could arrive at no definite conclusion. We were allconvinced that the box was on its way, by water, to somewhere; but wherethat might be we would have to discover. With heavy hearts we came hometo the hotel to Mina.When we met together, the first thing was to consult as to taking Minaagain into our confidence. Things are getting desperate, and it is atleast a chance, though a hazardous one. As a preliminary step, I wasreleased from my promise to her._Mina Harker’s Journal.__30 October, evening._--They were so tired and worn out and dispiritedthat there was nothing to be done till they had some rest; so I askedthem all to lie down for half an hour whilst I should enter everythingup to the moment. I feel so grateful to the man who invented the“Traveller’s” typewriter, and to Mr. Morris for getting this one forme. I should have felt quite astray doing the work if I had to writewith a pen....It is all done; poor dear, dear Jonathan, what he must have suffered,what must he be suffering now. He lies on the sofa hardly seeming tobreathe, and his whole body appears in collapse. His brows are knit; hisface is drawn with pain. Poor fellow, maybe he is thinking, and I cansee his face all wrinkled up with the concentration of his thoughts. Oh!if I could only help at all.... I shall do what I can.I have asked Dr. Van Helsing, and he has got me all the papers that Ihave not yet seen.... Whilst they are resting, I shall go over allcarefully, and perhaps I may arrive at some conclusion. I shall try tofollow the Professor’s example, and think without prejudice on the factsbefore me....*       *       *       *       *I do believe that under God’s providence I have made a discovery. Ishall get the maps and look over them....*       *       *       *       *I am more than ever sure that I am right. My new conclusion is ready, soI shall get our party together and read it. They can judge it; it iswell to be accurate, and every minute is precious._Mina Harker’s Memorandum._(Entered in her Journal.)_Ground of inquiry._--Count Dracula’s problem is to get back to his ownplace.(_a_) He must be _brought back_ by some one. This is evident; for had hepower to move himself as he wished he could go either as man, or wolf,or bat, or in some other way. He evidently fears discovery orinterference, in the state of helplessness in which he must be--confinedas he is between dawn and sunset in his wooden box.(_b_) _How is he to be taken?_--Here a process of exclusions may helpus. By road, by rail, by water?1. _By Road._--There are endless difficulties, especially in leaving thecity.(_x_) There are people; and people are curious, and investigate. A hint,a surmise, a doubt as to what might be in the box, would destroy him.(_y_) There are, or there may be, customs and octroi officers to pass.(_z_) His pursuers might follow. This is his highest fear; and in orderto prevent his being betrayed he has repelled, so far as he can, evenhis victim--me!2. _By Rail._--There is no one in charge of the box. It would have totake its chance of being delayed; and delay would be fatal, with enemieson the track. True, he might escape at night; but what would he be, ifleft in a strange place with no refuge that he could fly to? This is notwhat he intends; and he does not mean to risk it.3. _By Water._--Here is the safest way, in one respect, but with mostdanger in another. On the water he is powerless except at night; eventhen he can only summon fog and storm and snow and his wolves. But werehe wrecked, the living water would engulf him, helpless; and he wouldindeed be lost. He could have the vessel drive to land; but if it wereunfriendly land, wherein he was not free to move, his position wouldstill be desperate.We know from the record that he was on the water; so what we have to dois to ascertain _what_ water.The first thing is to realise exactly what he has done as yet; we may,then, get a light on what his later task is to be._Firstly._--We must differentiate between what he did in London as partof his general plan of action, when he was pressed for moments and hadto arrange as best he could._Secondly_ we must see, as well as we can surmise it from the facts weknow of, what he has done here.As to the first, he evidently intended to arrive at Galatz, and sentinvoice to Varna to deceive us lest we should ascertain his means ofexit from England; his immediate and sole purpose then was to escape.The proof of this, is the letter of instructions sent to ImmanuelHildesheim to clear and take away the box _before sunrise_. There isalso the instruction to Petrof Skinsky. These we must only guess at; butthere must have been some letter or message, since Skinsky came toHildesheim.That, so far, his plans were successful we know. The _Czarina Catherine_made a phenomenally quick journey--so much so that Captain Donelson’ssuspicions were aroused; but his superstition united with his canninessplayed the Count’s game for him, and he ran with his favouring windthrough fogs and all till he brought up blindfold at Galatz. That theCount’s arrangements were well made, has been proved. Hildesheim clearedthe box, took it off, and gave it to Skinsky. Skinsky took it--and herewe lose the trail. We only know that the box is somewhere on the water,moving along. The customs and the octroi, if there be any, have beenavoided.Now we come to what the Count must have done after his arrival--_onland_, at Galatz.The box was given to Skinsky before sunrise. At sunrise the Count couldappear in his own form. Here, we ask why Skinsky was chosen at all toaid in the work? In my husband’s diary, Skinsky is mentioned as dealingwith the Slovaks who trade down the river to the port; and the man’sremark, that the murder was the work of a Slovak, showed the generalfeeling against his class. The Count wanted isolation.My surmise is, this: that in London the Count decided to get back to hiscastle by water, as the most safe and secret way. He was brought fromthe castle by Szgany, and probably they delivered their cargo to Slovakswho took the boxes to Varna, for there they were shipped for London.Thus the Count had knowledge of the persons who could arrange thisservice. When the box was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, hecame out from his box, met Skinsky and instructed him what to do as toarranging the carriage of the box up some river. When this was done, andhe knew that all was in train, he blotted out his traces, as he thought,by murdering his agent.I have examined the map and find that the river most suitable for theSlovaks to have ascended is either the Pruth or the Sereth. I read inthe typescript that in my trance I heard cows low and water swirlinglevel with my ears and the creaking of wood. The Count in his box, then,was on a river in an open boat--propelled probably either by oars orpoles, for the banks are near and it is working against stream. Therewould be no such sound if floating down stream.Of course it may not be either the Sereth or the Pruth, but we maypossibly investigate further. Now of these two, the Pruth is the moreeasily navigated, but the Sereth is, at Fundu, joined by the Bistritzawhich runs up round the Borgo Pass. The loop it makes is manifestly asclose to Dracula’s castle as can be got by water._Mina Harker’s Journal--continued._When I had done reading, Jonathan took me in his arms and kissed me. Theothers kept shaking me by both hands, and Dr. Van Helsing said:--“Our dear Madam Mina is once more our teacher. Her eyes have been wherewe were blinded. Now we are on the track once again, and this time wemay succeed. Our enemy is at his most helpless; and if we can come onhim by day, on the water, our task will be over. He has a start, but heis powerless to hasten, as he may not leave his box lest those who carryhim may suspect; for them to suspect would be to prompt them to throwhim in the stream where he perish. This he knows, and will not. Now men,to our Council of War; for, here and now, we must plan what each and allshall do.”“I shall get a steam launch and follow him,” said Lord Godalming.“And I, horses to follow on the bank lest by chance he land,” said Mr.Morris.“Good!” said the Professor, “both good. But neither must go alone. Theremust be force to overcome force if need be; the Slovak is strong andrough, and he carries rude arms.” All the men smiled, for amongst themthey carried a small arsenal. Said Mr. Morris:--“I have brought some Winchesters; they are pretty handy in a crowd, andthere may be wolves. The Count, if you remember, took some otherprecautions; he made some requisitions on others that Mrs. Harker couldnot quite hear or understand. We must be ready at all points.” Dr.Seward said:--“I think I had better go with Quincey. We have been accustomed to hunttogether, and we two, well armed, will be a match for whatever may comealong. You must not be alone, Art. It may be necessary to fight theSlovaks, and a chance thrust--for I don’t suppose these fellows carryguns--would undo all our plans. There must be no chances, this time; weshall not rest until the Count’s head and body have been separated, andwe are sure that he cannot re-incarnate.” He looked at Jonathan as hespoke, and Jonathan looked at me. I could see that the poor dear wastorn about in his mind. Of course he wanted to be with me; but then theboat service would, most likely, be the one which would destroy the ...the ... the ... Vampire. (Why did I hesitate to write the word?) He wassilent awhile, and during his silence Dr. Van Helsing spoke:--“Friend Jonathan, this is to you for twice reasons. First, because youare young and brave and can fight, and all energies may be needed at thelast; and again that it is your right to destroy him--that--which haswrought such woe to you and yours. Be not afraid for Madam Mina; shewill be my care, if I may. I am old. My legs are not so quick to run asonce; and I am not used to ride so long or to pursue as need be, or tofight with lethal weapons. But I can be of other service; I can fight inother way. And I can die, if need be, as well as younger men. Now letme say that what I would is this: while you, my Lord Godalming andfriend Jonathan go in your so swift little steamboat up the river, andwhilst John and Quincey guard the bank where perchance he might belanded, I will take Madam Mina right into the heart of the enemy’scountry. Whilst the old fox is tied in his box, floating on the runningstream whence he cannot escape to land--where he dares not raise the lidof his coffin-box lest his Slovak carriers should in fear leave him toperish--we shall go in the track where Jonathan went,--from Bistritzover the Borgo, and find our way to the Castle of Dracula. Here, MadamMina’s hypnotic power will surely help, and we shall find our way--alldark and unknown otherwise--after the first sunrise when we are nearthat fateful place. There is much to be done, and other places to bemade sanctify, so that that nest of vipers be obliterated.” HereJonathan interrupted him hotly:--“Do you mean to say, Professor Van Helsing, that you would bring Mina,in her sad case and tainted as she is with that devil’s illness, rightinto the jaws of his death-trap? Not for the world! Not for Heaven orHell!” He became almost speechless for a minute, and then went on:--“Do you know what the place is? Have you seen that awful den of hellishinfamy--with the very moonlight alive with grisly shapes, and everyspeck of dust that whirls in the wind a devouring monster in embryo?Have you felt the Vampire’s lips upon your throat?” Here he turned tome, and as his eyes lit on my forehead he threw up his arms with a cry:“Oh, my God, what have we done to have this terror upon us!” and he sankdown on the sofa in a collapse of misery. The Professor’s voice, as hespoke in clear, sweet tones, which seemed to vibrate in the air, calmedus all:--“Oh, my friend, it is because I would save Madam Mina from that awfulplace that I would go. God forbid that I should take her into thatplace. There is work--wild work--to be done there, that her eyes may notsee. We men here, all save Jonathan, have seen with their own eyes whatis to be done before that place can be purify. Remember that we are interrible straits. If the Count escape us this time--and he is strong andsubtle and cunning--he may choose to sleep him for a century, and thenin time our dear one”--he took my hand--“would come to him to keep himcompany, and would be as those others that you, Jonathan, saw. You havetold us of their gloating lips; you heard their ribald laugh as theyclutched the moving bag that the Count threw to them. You shudder; andwell may it be. Forgive me that I make you so much pain, but it isnecessary. My friend, is it not a dire need for the which I am giving,possibly my life? If it were that any one went into that place to stay,it is I who would have to go to keep them company.”“Do as you will,” said Jonathan, with a sob that shook him all over, “weare in the hands of God!”*       *       *       *       *_Later._--Oh, it did me good to see the way that these brave men worked.How can women help loving men when they are so earnest, and so true, andso brave! And, too, it made me think of the wonderful power of money!What can it not do when it is properly applied; and what might it dowhen basely used. I felt so thankful that Lord Godalming is rich, andthat both he and Mr. Morris, who also has plenty of money, are willingto spend it so freely. For if they did not, our little expedition couldnot start, either so promptly or so well equipped, as it will withinanother hour. It is not three hours since it was arranged what part eachof us was to do; and now Lord Godalming and Jonathan have a lovely steamlaunch, with steam up ready to start at a moment’s notice. Dr. Sewardand Mr. Morris have half a dozen good horses, well appointed. We haveall the maps and appliances of various kinds that can be had. ProfessorVan Helsing and I are to leave by the 11:40 train to-night for Veresti,where we are to get a carriage to drive to the Borgo Pass. We arebringing a good deal of ready money, as we are to buy a carriage andhorses. We shall drive ourselves, for we have no one whom we can trustin the matter. The Professor knows something of a great many languages,so we shall get on all right. We have all got arms, even for me alarge-bore revolver; Jonathan would not be happy unless I was armed likethe rest. Alas! I cannot carry one arm that the rest do; the scar on myforehead forbids that. Dear Dr. Van Helsing comforts me by telling methat I am fully armed as there may be wolves; the weather is gettingcolder every hour, and there are snow-flurries which come and go aswarnings.*       *       *       *       *_Later._--It took all my courage to say good-bye to my darling. We maynever meet again. Courage, Mina! the Professor is looking at you keenly;his look is a warning. There must be no tears now--unless it may be thatGod will let them fall in gladness._Jonathan Harker’s Journal.__October 30. Night._--I am writing this in the light from the furnacedoor of the steam launch: Lord Godalming is firing up. He is anexperienced hand at the work, as he has had for years a launch of hisown on the Thames, and another on the Norfolk Broads. Regarding ourplans, we finally decided that Mina’s guess was correct, and that if anywaterway was chosen for the Count’s escape back to his Castle, theSereth and then the Bistritza at its junction, would be the one. We tookit, that somewhere about the 47th degree, north latitude, would be theplace chosen for the crossing the country between the river and theCarpathians. We have no fear in running at good speed up the river atnight; there is plenty of water, and the banks are wide enough apart tomake steaming, even in the dark, easy enough. Lord Godalming tells me tosleep for a while, as it is enough for the present for one to be onwatch. But I cannot sleep--how can I with the terrible danger hangingover my darling, and her going out into that awful place.... My onlycomfort is that we are in the hands of God. Only for that faith it wouldbe easier to die than to live, and so be quit of all the trouble. Mr.Morris and Dr. Seward were off on their long ride before we started;they are to keep up the right bank, far enough off to get on higherlands where they can see a good stretch of river and avoid the followingof its curves. They have, for the first stages, two men to ride and leadtheir spare horses--four in all, so as not to excite curiosity. Whenthey dismiss the men, which shall be shortly, they shall themselves lookafter the horses. It may be necessary for us to join forces; if so theycan mount our whole party. One of the saddles has a movable horn, andcan be easily adapted for Mina, if required.It is a wild adventure we are on. Here, as we are rushing along throughthe darkness, with the cold from the river seeming to rise up and strikeus; with all the mysterious voices of the night around us, it all comeshome. We seem to be drifting into unknown places and unknown ways; intoa whole world of dark and dreadful things. Godalming is shutting thefurnace door....*       *       *       *       *_31 October._--Still hurrying along. The day has come, and Godalming issleeping. I am on watch. The morning is bitterly cold; the furnace heatis grateful, though we have heavy fur coats. As yet we have passed onlya few open boats, but none of them had on board any box or package ofanything like the size of the one we seek. The men were scared everytime we turned our electric lamp on them, and fell on their knees andprayed.*       *       *       *       *_1 November, evening._--No news all day; we have found nothing of thekind we seek. We have now passed into the Bistritza; and if we are wrongin our surmise our chance is gone. We have over-hauled every boat, bigand little. Early this morning, one crew took us for a Government boat,and treated us accordingly. We saw in this a way of smoothing matters,so at Fundu, where the Bistritza runs into the Sereth, we got aRoumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously. With every boat which wehave over-hauled since then this trick has succeeded; we have had everydeference shown to us, and not once any objection to whatever we choseto ask or do. Some of the Slovaks tell us that a big boat passed them,going at more than usual speed as she had a double crew on board. Thiswas before they came to Fundu, so they could not tell us whether theboat turned into the Bistritza or continued on up the Sereth. At Funduwe could not hear of any such boat, so she must have passed there in thenight. I am feeling very sleepy; the cold is perhaps beginning to tellupon me, and nature must have rest some time. Godalming insists that heshall keep the first watch. God bless him for all his goodness to poordear Mina and me.*       *       *       *       *_2 November, morning._--It is broad daylight. That good fellow would notwake me. He says it would have been a sin to, for I slept peacefully andwas forgetting my trouble. It seems brutally selfish to me to have sleptso long, and let him watch all night; but he was quite right. I am a newman this morning; and, as I sit here and watch him sleeping, I can doall that is necessary both as to minding the engine, steering, andkeeping watch. I can feel that my strength and energy are coming back tome. I wonder where Mina is now, and Van Helsing. They should have got toVeresti about noon on Wednesday. It would take them some time to get thecarriage and horses; so if they had started and travelled hard, theywould be about now at the Borgo Pass. God guide and help them! I amafraid to think what may happen. If we could only go faster! but wecannot; the engines are throbbing and doing their utmost. I wonder howDr. Seward and Mr. Morris are getting on. There seem to be endlessstreams running down the mountains into this river, but as none of themare very large--at present, at all events, though they are terribledoubtless in winter and when the snow melts--the horsemen may not havemet much obstruction. I hope that before we get to Strasba we may seethem; for if by that time we have not overtaken the Count, it may benecessary to take counsel together what to do next._Dr. Seward’s Diary.__2 November._--Three days on the road. No news, and no time to write itif there had been, for every moment is precious. We have had only therest needful for the horses; but we are both bearing it wonderfully.Those adventurous days of ours are turning up useful. We must push on;we shall never feel happy till we get the launch in sight again.*       *       *       *       *_3 November._--We heard at Fundu that the launch had gone up theBistritza. I wish it wasn’t so cold. There are signs of snow coming; andif it falls heavy it will stop us. In such case we must get a sledge andgo on, Russian fashion.*       *       *       *       *_4 November._--To-day we heard of the launch having been detained by anaccident when trying to force a way up the rapids. The Slovak boats getup all right, by aid of a rope and steering with knowledge. Some went uponly a few hours before. Godalming is an amateur fitter himself, andevidently it was he who put the launch in trim again. Finally, they gotup the rapids all right, with local help, and are off on the chaseafresh. I fear that the boat is not any better for the accident; thepeasantry tell us that after she got upon smooth water again, she keptstopping every now and again so long as she was in sight. We must pushon harder than ever; our help may be wanted soon._Mina Harker’s Journal.__31 October._--Arrived at Veresti at noon. The Professor tells me thatthis morning at dawn he could hardly hypnotise me at all, and that all Icould say was: “dark and quiet.” He is off now buying a carriage andhorses. He says that he will later on try to buy additional horses, sothat we may be able to change them on the way. We have something morethan 70 miles before us. The country is lovely, and most interesting; ifonly we were under different conditions, how delightful it would be tosee it all. If Jonathan and I were driving through it alone what apleasure it would be. To stop and see people, and learn something oftheir life, and to fill our minds and memories with all the colour andpicturesqueness of the whole wild, beautiful country and the quaintpeople! But, alas!--*       *       *       *       *_Later._--Dr. Van Helsing has returned. He has got the carriage andhorses; we are to have some dinner, and to start in an hour. Thelandlady is putting us up a huge basket of provisions; it seems enoughfor a company of soldiers. The Professor encourages her, and whispers tome that it may be a week before we can get any good food again. He hasbeen shopping too, and has sent home such a wonderful lot of fur coatsand wraps, and all sorts of warm things. There will not be any chance ofour being cold.*       *       *       *       *We shall soon be off. I am afraid to think what may happen to us. We aretruly in the hands of God. He alone knows what may be, and I pray Him,with all the strength of my sad and humble soul, that He will watch overmy beloved husband; that whatever may happen, Jonathan may know that Iloved him and honoured him more than I can say, and that my latest andtruest thought will be always for him.CHAPTER XXVIIMINA HARKER’S JOURNAL_1 November._--All day long we have travelled, and at a good speed. Thehorses seem to know that they are being kindly treated, for they gowillingly their full stage at best speed. We have now had so manychanges and find the same thing so constantly that we are encouraged tothink that the journey will be an easy one. Dr. Van Helsing is laconic;he tells the farmers that he is hurrying to Bistritz, and pays them wellto make the exchange of horses. We get hot soup, or coffee, or tea; andoff we go. It is a lovely country; full of beauties of all imaginablekinds, and the people are brave, and strong, and simple, and seem fullof nice qualities. They are _very, very_ superstitious. In the firsthouse where we stopped, when the woman who served us saw the scar on myforehead, she crossed herself and put out two fingers towards me, tokeep off the evil eye. I believe they went to the trouble of putting anextra amount of garlic into our food; and I can’t abide garlic. Eversince then I have taken care not to take off my hat or veil, and so haveescaped their suspicions. We are travelling fast, and as we have nodriver with us to carry tales, we go ahead of scandal; but I daresaythat fear of the evil eye will follow hard behind us all the way. TheProfessor seems tireless; all day he would not take any rest, though hemade me sleep for a long spell. At sunset time he hypnotised me, and hesays that I answered as usual “darkness, lapping water and creakingwood”; so our enemy is still on the river. I am afraid to think ofJonathan, but somehow I have now no fear for him, or for myself. I writethis whilst we wait in a farmhouse for the horses to be got ready. Dr.Van Helsing is sleeping. Poor dear, he looks very tired and old andgrey, but his mouth is set as firmly as a conqueror’s; even in his sleephe is instinct with resolution. When we have well started I must makehim rest whilst I drive. I shall tell him that we have days before us,and we must not break down when most of all his strength will beneeded.... All is ready; we are off shortly.*       *       *       *       *_2 November, morning._--I was successful, and we took turns driving allnight; now the day is on us, bright though cold. There is a strangeheaviness in the air--I say heaviness for want of a better word; I meanthat it oppresses us both. It is very cold, and only our warm furs keepus comfortable. At dawn Van Helsing hypnotised me; he says I answered“darkness, creaking wood and roaring water,” so the river is changing asthey ascend. I do hope that my darling will not run any chance ofdanger--more than need be; but we are in God’s hands.*       *       *       *       *_2 November, night._--All day long driving. The country gets wilder aswe go, and the great spurs of the Carpathians, which at Veresti seemedso far from us and so low on the horizon, now seem to gather round usand tower in front. We both seem in good spirits; I think we make aneffort each to cheer the other; in the doing so we cheer ourselves. Dr.Van Helsing says that by morning we shall reach the Borgo Pass. Thehouses are very few here now, and the Professor says that the last horsewe got will have to go on with us, as we may not be able to change. Hegot two in addition to the two we changed, so that now we have a rudefour-in-hand. The dear horses are patient and good, and they give us notrouble. We are not worried with other travellers, and so even I candrive. We shall get to the Pass in daylight; we do not want to arrivebefore. So we take it easy, and have each a long rest in turn. Oh, whatwill to-morrow bring to us? We go to seek the place where my poordarling suffered so much. God grant that we may be guided aright, andthat He will deign to watch over my husband and those dear to us both,and who are in such deadly peril. As for me, I am not worthy in Hissight. Alas! I am unclean to His eyes, and shall be until He may deignto let me stand forth in His sight as one of those who have not incurredHis wrath._Memorandum by Abraham Van Helsing.__4 November._--This to my old and true friend John Seward, M.D., ofPurfleet, London, in case I may not see him. It may explain. It ismorning, and I write by a fire which all the night I have keptalive--Madam Mina aiding me. It is cold, cold; so cold that the greyheavy sky is full of snow, which when it falls will settle for allwinter as the ground is hardening to receive it. It seems to haveaffected Madam Mina; she has been so heavy of head all day that she wasnot like herself. She sleeps, and sleeps, and sleeps! She who is usualso alert, have done literally nothing all the day; she even have losther appetite. She make no entry into her little diary, she who write sofaithful at every pause. Something whisper to me that all is not well.However, to-night she is more _vif_. Her long sleep all day have refreshand restore her, for now she is all sweet and bright as ever. At sunsetI try to hypnotise her, but alas! with no effect; the power has grownless and less with each day, and to-night it fail me altogether. Well,God’s will be done--whatever it may be, and whithersoever it may lead!Now to the historical, for as Madam Mina write not in her stenography, Imust, in my cumbrous old fashion, that so each day of us may not gounrecorded.We got to the Borgo Pass just after sunrise yesterday morning. When Isaw the signs of the dawn I got ready for the hypnotism. We stopped ourcarriage, and got down so that there might be no disturbance. I made acouch with furs, and Madam Mina, lying down, yield herself as usual, butmore slow and more short time than ever, to the hypnotic sleep. Asbefore, came the answer: “darkness and the swirling of water.” Then shewoke, bright and radiant and we go on our way and soon reach the Pass.At this time and place, she become all on fire with zeal; some newguiding power be in her manifested, for she point to a road and say:--“This is the way.”“How know you it?” I ask.“Of course I know it,” she answer, and with a pause, add: “Have not myJonathan travelled it and wrote of his travel?”At first I think somewhat strange, but soon I see that there be only onesuch by-road. It is used but little, and very different from the coachroad from the Bukovina to Bistritz, which is more wide and hard, andmore of use.So we came down this road; when we meet other ways--not always were wesure that they were roads at all, for they be neglect and light snowhave fallen--the horses know and they only. I give rein to them, andthey go on so patient. By-and-by we find all the things which Jonathanhave note in that wonderful diary of him. Then we go on for long, longhours and hours. At the first, I tell Madam Mina to sleep; she try, andshe succeed. She sleep all the time; till at the last, I feel myself tosuspicious grow, and attempt to wake her. But she sleep on, and I maynot wake her though I try. I do not wish to try too hard lest I harmher; for I know that she have suffer much, and sleep at times beall-in-all to her. I think I drowse myself, for all of sudden I feelguilt, as though I have done something; I find myself bolt up, with thereins in my hand, and the good horses go along jog, jog, just as ever. Ilook down and find Madam Mina still sleep. It is now not far off sunsettime, and over the snow the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood,so that we throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so steep.For we are going up, and up; and all is oh! so wild and rocky, as thoughit were the end of the world.Then I arouse Madam Mina. This time she wake with not much trouble, andthen I try to put her to hypnotic sleep. But she sleep not, being asthough I were not. Still I try and try, till all at once I find her andmyself in dark; so I look round, and find that the sun have gone down.Madam Mina laugh, and I turn and look at her. She is now quite awake,and look so well as I never saw her since that night at Carfax when wefirst enter the Count’s house. I am amaze, and not at ease then; but sheis so bright and tender and thoughtful for me that I forget all fear. Ilight a fire, for we have brought supply of wood with us, and sheprepare food while I undo the horses and set them, tethered in shelter,to feed. Then when I return to the fire she have my supper ready. I goto help her; but she smile, and tell me that she have eat already--thatshe was so hungry that she would not wait. I like it not, and I havegrave doubts; but I fear to affright her, and so I am silent of it. Shehelp me and I eat alone; and then we wrap in fur and lie beside thefire, and I tell her to sleep while I watch. But presently I forget allof watching; and when I sudden remember that I watch, I find her lyingquiet, but awake, and looking at me with so bright eyes. Once, twicemore the same occur, and I get much sleep till before morning. When Iwake I try to hypnotise her; but alas! though she shut her eyesobedient, she may not sleep. The sun rise up, and up, and up; and thensleep come to her too late, but so heavy that she will not wake. I haveto lift her up, and place her sleeping in the carriage when I haveharnessed the horses and made all ready. Madam still sleep, and she lookin her sleep more healthy and more redder than before. And I like itnot. And I am afraid, afraid, afraid!--I am afraid of all things--evento think but I must go on my way. The stake we play for is life anddeath, or more than these, and we must not flinch.*       *       *       *       *_5 November, morning._--Let me be accurate in everything, for though youand I have seen some strange things together, you may at the first thinkthat I, Van Helsing, am mad--that the many horrors and the so longstrain on nerves has at the last turn my brain.All yesterday we travel, ever getting closer to the mountains, andmoving into a more and more wild and desert land. There are great,frowning precipices and much falling water, and Nature seem to have heldsometime her carnival. Madam Mina still sleep and sleep; and though Idid have hunger and appeased it, I could not waken her--even for food. Ibegan to fear that the fatal spell of the place was upon her, tainted asshe is with that Vampire baptism. “Well,” said I to myself, “if it bethat she sleep all the day, it shall also be that I do not sleep atnight.” As we travel on the rough road, for a road of an ancient andimperfect kind there was, I held down my head and slept. Again I wakedwith a sense of guilt and of time passed, and found Madam Mina stillsleeping, and the sun low down. But all was indeed changed; the frowningmountains seemed further away, and we were near the top of asteep-rising hill, on summit of which was such a castle as Jonathan tellof in his diary. At once I exulted and feared; for now, for good or ill,the end was near.I woke Madam Mina, and again tried to hypnotise her; but alas!unavailing till too late. Then, ere the great dark came upon us--foreven after down-sun the heavens reflected the gone sun on the snow, andall was for a time in a great twilight--I took out the horses and fedthem in what shelter I could. Then I make a fire; and near it I makeMadam Mina, now awake and more charming than ever, sit comfortable amidher rugs. I got ready food: but she would not eat, simply saying thatshe had not hunger. I did not press her, knowing her unavailingness. ButI myself eat, for I must needs now be strong for all. Then, with thefear on me of what might be, I drew a ring so big for her comfort, roundwhere Madam Mina sat; and over the ring I passed some of the wafer, andI broke it fine so that all was well guarded. She sat still all thetime--so still as one dead; and she grew whiter and ever whiter till thesnow was not more pale; and no word she said. But when I drew near, sheclung to me, and I could know that the poor soul shook her from head tofeet with a tremor that was pain to feel. I said to her presently, whenshe had grown more quiet:--“Will you not come over to the fire?” for I wished to make a test ofwhat she could. She rose obedient, but when she have made a step shestopped, and stood as one stricken.“Why not go on?” I asked. She shook her head, and, coming back, satdown in her place. Then, looking at me with open eyes, as of one wakedfrom sleep, she said simply:--“I cannot!” and remained silent. I rejoiced, for I knew that what shecould not, none of those that we dreaded could. Though there might bedanger to her body, yet her soul was safe!Presently the horses began to scream, and tore at their tethers till Icame to them and quieted them. When they did feel my hands on them, theywhinnied low as in joy, and licked at my hands and were quiet for atime. Many times through the night did I come to them, till it arrive tothe cold hour when all nature is at lowest; and every time my coming waswith quiet of them. In the cold hour the fire began to die, and I wasabout stepping forth to replenish it, for now the snow came in flyingsweeps and with it a chill mist. Even in the dark there was a light ofsome kind, as there ever is over snow; and it seemed as though thesnow-flurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of women withtrailing garments. All was in dead, grim silence only that the horseswhinnied and cowered, as if in terror of the worst. I began tofear--horrible fears; but then came to me the sense of safety in thatring wherein I stood. I began, too, to think that my imaginings were ofthe night, and the gloom, and the unrest that I have gone through, andall the terrible anxiety. It was as though my memories of all Jonathan’shorrid experience were befooling me; for the snow flakes and the mistbegan to wheel and circle round, till I could get as though a shadowyglimpse of those women that would have kissed him. And then the horsescowered lower and lower, and moaned in terror as men do in pain. Eventhe madness of fright was not to them, so that they could break away. Ifeared for my dear Madam Mina when these weird figures drew near andcircled round. I looked at her, but she sat calm, and smiled at me; whenI would have stepped to the fire to replenish it, she caught me and heldme back, and whispered, like a voice that one hears in a dream, so lowit was:--“No! No! Do not go without. Here you are safe!” I turned to her, andlooking in her eyes, said:--“But you? It is for you that I fear!” whereat she laughed--a laugh, lowand unreal, and said:--“Fear for _me_! Why fear for me? None safer in all the world from themthan I am,” and as I wondered at the meaning of her words, a puff ofwind made the flame leap up, and I see the red scar on her forehead.Then, alas! I knew. Did I not, I would soon have learned, for thewheeling figures of mist and snow came closer, but keeping ever withoutthe Holy circle. Then they began to materialise till--if God have nottake away my reason, for I saw it through my eyes--there were before mein actual flesh the same three women that Jonathan saw in the room, whenthey would have kissed his throat. I knew the swaying round forms, thebright hard eyes, the white teeth, the ruddy colour, the voluptuouslips. They smiled ever at poor dear Madam Mina; and as their laugh camethrough the silence of the night, they twined their arms and pointed toher, and said in those so sweet tingling tones that Jonathan said wereof the intolerable sweetness of the water-glasses:--“Come, sister. Come to us. Come! Come!” In fear I turned to my poorMadam Mina, and my heart with gladness leapt like flame; for oh! theterror in her sweet eyes, the repulsion, the horror, told a story to myheart that was all of hope. God be thanked she was not, yet, of them. Iseized some of the firewood which was by me, and holding out some of theWafer, advanced on them towards the fire. They drew back before me, andlaughed their low horrid laugh. I fed the fire, and feared them not; forI knew that we were safe within our protections. They could notapproach, me, whilst so armed, nor Madam Mina whilst she remained withinthe ring, which she could not leave no more than they could enter. Thehorses had ceased to moan, and lay still on the ground; the snow fell onthem softly, and they grew whiter. I knew that there was for the poorbeasts no more of terror.And so we remained till the red of the dawn to fall through thesnow-gloom. I was desolate and afraid, and full of woe and terror; butwhen that beautiful sun began to climb the horizon life was to me again.At the first coming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in thewhirling mist and snow; the wreaths of transparent gloom moved awaytowards the castle, and were lost.Instinctively, with the dawn coming, I turned to Madam Mina, intendingto hypnotise her; but she lay in a deep and sudden sleep, from which Icould not wake her. I tried to hypnotise through her sleep, but she madeno response, none at all; and the day broke. I fear yet to stir. I havemade my fire and have seen the horses, they are all dead. To-day I havemuch to do here, and I keep waiting till the sun is up high; for theremay be places where I must go, where that sunlight, though snow and mistobscure it, will be to me a safety.I will strengthen me with breakfast, and then I will to my terriblework. Madam Mina still sleeps; and, God be thanked! she is calm in hersleep...._Jonathan Harker’s Journal.__4 November, evening._--The accident to the launch has been a terriblething for us. Only for it we should have overtaken the boat long ago;and by now my dear Mina would have been free. I fear to think of her,off on the wolds near that horrid place. We have got horses, and wefollow on the track. I note this whilst Godalming is getting ready. Wehave our arms. The Szgany must look out if they mean fight. Oh, if onlyMorris and Seward were with us. We must only hope! If I write no moreGood-bye, Mina! God bless and keep you._Dr. Seward’s Diary.__5 November._--With the dawn we saw the body of Szgany before us dashingaway from the river with their leiter-wagon. They surrounded it in acluster, and hurried along as though beset. The snow is falling lightlyand there is a strange excitement in the air. It may be our ownfeelings, but the depression is strange. Far off I hear the howling ofwolves; the snow brings them down from the mountains, and there aredangers to all of us, and from all sides. The horses are nearly ready,and we are soon off. We ride to death of some one. God alone knows who,or where, or what, or when, or how it may be...._Dr. Van Helsing’s Memorandum.__5 November, afternoon._--I am at least sane. Thank God for that mercyat all events, though the proving it has been dreadful. When I leftMadam Mina sleeping within the Holy circle, I took my way to the castle.The blacksmith hammer which I took in the carriage from Veresti wasuseful; though the doors were all open I broke them off the rustyhinges, lest some ill-intent or ill-chance should close them, so thatbeing entered I might not get out. Jonathan’s bitter experience servedme here. By memory of his diary I found my way to the old chapel, for Iknew that here my work lay. The air was oppressive; it seemed as ifthere was some sulphurous fume, which at times made me dizzy. Eitherthere was a roaring in my ears or I heard afar off the howl of wolves.Then I bethought me of my dear Madam Mina, and I was in terrible plight.The dilemma had me between his horns.Her, I had not dare to take into this place, but left safe from theVampire in that Holy circle; and yet even there would be the wolf! Iresolve me that my work lay here, and that as to the wolves we mustsubmit, if it were God’s will. At any rate it was only death andfreedom beyond. So did I choose for her. Had it but been for myself thechoice had been easy, the maw of the wolf were better to rest in thanthe grave of the Vampire! So I make my choice to go on with my work.I knew that there were at least three graves to find--graves that areinhabit; so I search, and search, and I find one of them. She lay in herVampire sleep, so full of life and voluptuous beauty that I shudder asthough I have come to do murder. Ah, I doubt not that in old time, whensuch things were, many a man who set forth to do such a task as mine,found at the last his heart fail him, and then his nerve. So he delay,and delay, and delay, till the mere beauty and the fascination of thewanton Un-Dead have hypnotise him; and he remain on and on, till sunsetcome, and the Vampire sleep be over. Then the beautiful eyes of the fairwoman open and look love, and the voluptuous mouth present to akiss--and man is weak. And there remain one more victim in the Vampirefold; one more to swell the grim and grisly ranks of the Un-Dead!...There is some fascination, surely, when I am moved by the mere presenceof such an one, even lying as she lay in a tomb fretted with age andheavy with the dust of centuries, though there be that horrid odour suchas the lairs of the Count have had. Yes, I was moved--I, Van Helsing,with all my purpose and with my motive for hate--I was moved to ayearning for delay which seemed to paralyse my faculties and to clog myvery soul. It may have been that the need of natural sleep, and thestrange oppression of the air were beginning to overcome me. Certain itwas that I was lapsing into sleep, the open-eyed sleep of one who yieldsto a sweet fascination, when there came through the snow-stilled air along, low wail, so full of woe and pity that it woke me like the soundof a clarion. For it was the voice of my dear Madam Mina that I heard.Then I braced myself again to my horrid task, and found by wrenchingaway tomb-tops one other of the sisters, the other dark one. I dared notpause to look on her as I had on her sister, lest once more I shouldbegin to be enthrall; but I go on searching until, presently, I find ina high great tomb as if made to one much beloved that other fair sisterwhich, like Jonathan I had seen to gather herself out of the atoms ofthe mist. She was so fair to look on, so radiantly beautiful, soexquisitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in me, which callssome of my sex to love and to protect one of hers, made my head whirlwith new emotion. But God be thanked, that soul-wail of my dear MadamMina had not died out of my ears; and, before the spell could be wroughtfurther upon me, I had nerved myself to my wild work. By this time I hadsearched all the tombs in the chapel, so far as I could tell; and asthere had been only three of these Un-Dead phantoms around us in thenight, I took it that there were no more of active Un-Dead existent.There was one great tomb more lordly than all the rest; huge it was, andnobly proportioned. On it was but one wordDRACULA.This then was the Un-Dead home of the King-Vampire, to whom so many morewere due. Its emptiness spoke eloquent to make certain what I knew.Before I began to restore these women to their dead selves through myawful work, I laid in Dracula’s tomb some of the Wafer, and so banishedhim from it, Un-Dead, for ever.Then began my terrible task, and I dreaded it. Had it been but one, ithad been easy, comparative. But three! To begin twice more after I hadbeen through a deed of horror; for if it was terrible with the sweetMiss Lucy, what would it not be with these strange ones who had survivedthrough centuries, and who had been strengthened by the passing of theyears; who would, if they could, have fought for their foul lives....Oh, my friend John, but it was butcher work; had I not been nerved bythoughts of other dead, and of the living over whom hung such a pall offear, I could not have gone on. I tremble and tremble even yet, thoughtill all was over, God be thanked, my nerve did stand. Had I not seenthe repose in the first place, and the gladness that stole over it justere the final dissolution came, as realisation that the soul had beenwon, I could not have gone further with my butchery. I could not haveendured the horrid screeching as the stake drove home; the plunging ofwrithing form, and lips of bloody foam. I should have fled in terror andleft my work undone. But it is over! And the poor souls, I can pity themnow and weep, as I think of them placid each in her full sleep of deathfor a short moment ere fading. For, friend John, hardly had my knifesevered the head of each, before the whole body began to melt away andcrumble in to its native dust, as though the death that should have comecenturies agone had at last assert himself and say at once and loud “Iam here!”Before I left the castle I so fixed its entrances that never more canthe Count enter there Un-Dead.When I stepped into the circle where Madam Mina slept, she woke from hersleep, and, seeing, me, cried out in pain that I had endured too much.“Come!” she said, “come away from this awful place! Let us go to meet myhusband who is, I know, coming towards us.” She was looking thin andpale and weak; but her eyes were pure and glowed with fervour. I wasglad to see her paleness and her illness, for my mind was full of thefresh horror of that ruddy vampire sleep.And so with trust and hope, and yet full of fear, we go eastward to meetour friends--and _him_--whom Madam Mina tell me that she _know_ arecoming to meet us._Mina Harker’s Journal.__6 November._--It was late in the afternoon when the Professor and Itook our way towards the east whence I knew Jonathan was coming. We didnot go fast, though the way was steeply downhill, for we had to takeheavy rugs and wraps with us; we dared not face the possibility of beingleft without warmth in the cold and the snow. We had to take some of ourprovisions, too, for we were in a perfect desolation, and, so far as wecould see through the snowfall, there was not even the sign ofhabitation. When we had gone about a mile, I was tired with the heavywalking and sat down to rest. Then we looked back and saw where theclear line of Dracula’s castle cut the sky; for we were so deep underthe hill whereon it was set that the angle of perspective of theCarpathian mountains was far below it. We saw it in all its grandeur,perched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipice, and withseemingly a great gap between it and the steep of the adjacent mountainon any side. There was something wild and uncanny about the place. Wecould hear the distant howling of wolves. They were far off, but thesound, even though coming muffled through the deadening snowfall, wasfull of terror. I knew from the way Dr. Van Helsing was searching aboutthat he was trying to seek some strategic point, where we would be lessexposed in case of attack. The rough roadway still led downwards; wecould trace it through the drifted snow.In a little while the Professor signalled to me, so I got up and joinedhim. He had found a wonderful spot, a sort of natural hollow in a rock,with an entrance like a doorway between two boulders. He took me by thehand and drew me in: “See!” he said, “here you will be in shelter; andif the wolves do come I can meet them one by one.” He brought in ourfurs, and made a snug nest for me, and got out some provisions andforced them upon me. But I could not eat; to even try to do so wasrepulsive to me, and, much as I would have liked to please him, I couldnot bring myself to the attempt. He looked very sad, but did notreproach me. Taking his field-glasses from the case, he stood on the topof the rock, and began to search the horizon. Suddenly he called out:--“Look! Madam Mina, look! look!” I sprang up and stood beside him on therock; he handed me his glasses and pointed. The snow was now fallingmore heavily, and swirled about fiercely, for a high wind was beginningto blow. However, there were times when there were pauses between thesnow flurries and I could see a long way round. From the height where wewere it was possible to see a great distance; and far off, beyond thewhite waste of snow, I could see the river lying like a black ribbon inkinks and curls as it wound its way. Straight in front of us and not faroff--in fact, so near that I wondered we had not noticed before--came agroup of mounted men hurrying along. In the midst of them was a cart, along leiter-wagon which swept from side to side, like a dog’s tailwagging, with each stern inequality of the road. Outlined against thesnow as they were, I could see from the men’s clothes that they werepeasants or gypsies of some kind.On the cart was a great square chest. My heart leaped as I saw it, for Ifelt that the end was coming. The evening was now drawing close, andwell I knew that at sunset the Thing, which was till then imprisonedthere, would take new freedom and could in any of many forms elude allpursuit. In fear I turned to the Professor; to my consternation,however, he was not there. An instant later, I saw him below me. Roundthe rock he had drawn a circle, such as we had found shelter in lastnight. When he had completed it he stood beside me again, saying:--“At least you shall be safe here from _him_!” He took the glasses fromme, and at the next lull of the snow swept the whole space below us.“See,” he said, “they come quickly; they are flogging the horses, andgalloping as hard as they can.” He paused and went on in a hollowvoice:--“They are racing for the sunset. We may be too late. God’s will bedone!” Down came another blinding rush of driving snow, and the wholelandscape was blotted out. It soon passed, however, and once more hisglasses were fixed on the plain. Then came a sudden cry:--“Look! Look! Look! See, two horsemen follow fast, coming up from thesouth. It must be Quincey and John. Take the glass. Look before the snowblots it all out!” I took it and looked. The two men might be Dr. Sewardand Mr. Morris. I knew at all events that neither of them was Jonathan.At the same time I _knew_ that Jonathan was not far off; looking aroundI saw on the north side of the coming party two other men, riding atbreak-neck speed. One of them I knew was Jonathan, and the other I took,of course, to be Lord Godalming. They, too, were pursuing the party withthe cart. When I told the Professor he shouted in glee like a schoolboy,and, after looking intently till a snow fall made sight impossible, helaid his Winchester rifle ready for use against the boulder at theopening of our shelter. “They are all converging,” he said. “When thetime comes we shall have gypsies on all sides.” I got out my revolverready to hand, for whilst we were speaking the howling of wolves camelouder and closer. When the snow storm abated a moment we looked again.It was strange to see the snow falling in such heavy flakes close to us,and beyond, the sun shining more and more brightly as it sank downtowards the far mountain tops. Sweeping the glass all around us I couldsee here and there dots moving singly and in twos and threes and largernumbers--the wolves were gathering for their prey.Every instant seemed an age whilst we waited. The wind came now infierce bursts, and the snow was driven with fury as it swept upon us incircling eddies. At times we could not see an arm’s length before us;but at others, as the hollow-sounding wind swept by us, it seemed toclear the air-space around us so that we could see afar off. We had oflate been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset, that we knewwith fair accuracy when it would be; and we knew that before long thesun would set. It was hard to believe that by our watches it was lessthan an hour that we waited in that rocky shelter before the variousbodies began to converge close upon us. The wind came now with fiercerand more bitter sweeps, and more steadily from the north. It seeminglyhad driven the snow clouds from us, for, with only occasional bursts,the snow fell. We could distinguish clearly the individuals of eachparty, the pursued and the pursuers. Strangely enough those pursued didnot seem to realise, or at least to care, that they were pursued; theyseemed, however, to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lowerand lower on the mountain tops.Closer and closer they drew. The Professor and I crouched down behindour rock, and held our weapons ready; I could see that he was determinedthat they should not pass. One and all were quite unaware of ourpresence.All at once two voices shouted out to: “Halt!” One was my Jonathan’s,raised in a high key of passion; the other Mr. Morris’ strong resolutetone of quiet command. The gypsies may not have known the language, butthere was no mistaking the tone, in whatever tongue the words werespoken. Instinctively they reined in, and at the instant Lord Godalmingand Jonathan dashed up at one side and Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris on theother. The leader of the gypsies, a splendid-looking fellow who sat hishorse like a centaur, waved them back, and in a fierce voice gave to hiscompanions some word to proceed. They lashed the horses which sprangforward; but the four men raised their Winchester rifles, and in anunmistakable way commanded them to stop. At the same moment Dr. VanHelsing and I rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them.Seeing that they were surrounded the men tightened their reins and drewup. The leader turned to them and gave a word at which every man of thegypsy party drew what weapon he carried, knife or pistol, and heldhimself in readiness to attack. Issue was joined in an instant.The leader, with a quick movement of his rein, threw his horse out infront, and pointing first to the sun--now close down on the hilltops--and then to the castle, said something which I did not understand.For answer, all four men of our party threw themselves from their horsesand dashed towards the cart. I should have felt terrible fear at seeingJonathan in such danger, but that the ardour of battle must have beenupon me as well as the rest of them; I felt no fear, but only a wild,surging desire to do something. Seeing the quick movement of ourparties, the leader of the gypsies gave a command; his men instantlyformed round the cart in a sort of undisciplined endeavour, each oneshouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carry out theorder.In the midst of this I could see that Jonathan on one side of the ringof men, and Quincey on the other, were forcing a way to the cart; it wasevident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sunshould set. Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them. Neither thelevelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front, northe howling of the wolves behind, appeared to even attract theirattention. Jonathan’s impetuosity, and the manifest singleness of hispurpose, seemed to overawe those in front of him; instinctively theycowered, aside and let him pass. In an instant he had jumped upon thecart, and, with a strength which seemed incredible, raised the greatbox, and flung it over the wheel to the ground. In the meantime, Mr.Morris had had to use force to pass through his side of the ring ofSzgany. All the time I had been breathlessly watching Jonathan I had,with the tail of my eye, seen him pressing desperately forward, and hadseen the knives of the gypsies flash as he won a way through them, andthey cut at him. He had parried with his great bowie knife, and at firstI thought that he too had come through in safety; but as he sprangbeside Jonathan, who had by now jumped from the cart, I could see thatwith his left hand he was clutching at his side, and that the blood wasspurting through his fingers. He did not delay notwithstanding this, foras Jonathan, with desperate energy, attacked one end of the chest,attempting to prize off the lid with his great Kukri knife, he attackedthe other frantically with his bowie. Under the efforts of both men thelid began to yield; the nails drew with a quick screeching sound, andthe top of the box was thrown back.By this time the gypsies, seeing themselves covered by the Winchesters,and at the mercy of Lord Godalming and Dr. Seward, had given in and madeno resistance. The sun was almost down on the mountain tops, and theshadows of the whole group fell long upon the snow. I saw the Countlying within the box upon the earth, some of which the rude falling fromthe cart had scattered over him. He was deathly pale, just like a waxenimage, and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which Iknew too well.As I looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in themturned to triumph.But, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of Jonathan’s great knife.I shrieked as I saw it shear through the throat; whilst at the samemoment Mr. Morris’s bowie knife plunged into the heart.It was like a miracle; but before our very eyes, and almost in thedrawing of a breath, the whole body crumbled into dust and passed fromour sight.I shall be glad as long as I live that even in that moment of finaldissolution, there was in the face a look of peace, such as I nevercould have imagined might have rested there.The Castle of Dracula now stood out against the red sky, and every stoneof its broken battlements was articulated against the light of thesetting sun.The gypsies, taking us as in some way the cause of the extraordinarydisappearance of the dead man, turned, without a word, and rode away asif for their lives. Those who were unmounted jumped upon theleiter-wagon and shouted to the horsemen not to desert them. The wolves,which had withdrawn to a safe distance, followed in their wake, leavingus alone.Mr. Morris, who had sunk to the ground, leaned on his elbow, holding hishand pressed to his side; the blood still gushed through his fingers. Iflew to him, for the Holy circle did not now keep me back; so did thetwo doctors. Jonathan knelt behind him and the wounded man laid back hishead on his shoulder. With a sigh he took, with a feeble effort, my handin that of his own which was unstained. He must have seen the anguish ofmy heart in my face, for he smiled at me and said:--“I am only too happy to have been of any service! Oh, God!” he criedsuddenly, struggling up to a sitting posture and pointing to me, “It wasworth for this to die! Look! look!”The sun was now right down upon the mountain top, and the red gleamsfell upon my face, so that it was bathed in rosy light. With one impulsethe men sank on their knees and a deep and earnest “Amen” broke from allas their eyes followed the pointing of his finger. The dying manspoke:--“Now God be thanked that all has not been in vain! See! the snow is notmore stainless than her forehead! The curse has passed away!”And, to our bitter grief, with a smile and in silence, he died, agallant gentleman.NOTESeven years ago we all went through the flames; and the happiness ofsome of us since then is, we think, well worth the pain we endured. Itis an added joy to Mina and to me that our boy’s birthday is the sameday as that on which Quincey Morris died. His mother holds, I know, thesecret belief that some of our brave friend’s spirit has passed intohim. His bundle of names links all our little band of men together; butwe call him Quincey.In the summer of this year we made a journey to Transylvania, and wentover the old ground which was, and is, to us so full of vivid andterrible memories. It was almost impossible to believe that the thingswhich we had seen with our own eyes and heard with our own ears wereliving truths. Every trace of all that had been was blotted out. Thecastle stood as before, reared high above a waste of desolation.When we got home we were talking of the old time--which we could alllook back on without despair, for Godalming and Seward are both happilymarried. I took the papers from the safe where they had been ever sinceour return so long ago. We were struck with the fact, that in all themass of material of which the record is composed, there is hardly oneauthentic document; nothing but a mass of typewriting, except the laternote-books of Mina and Seward and myself, and Van Helsing’s memorandum.We could hardly ask any one, even did we wish to, to accept these asproofs of so wild a story. Van Helsing summed it all up as he said, withour boy on his knee:--“We want no proofs; we ask none to believe us! This boy will some dayknow what a brave and gallant woman his mother is. Already he knows hersweetness and loving care; later on he will understand how some men soloved her, that they did dare much for her sake.”JONATHAN HARKER.THE END*       *       *       *       *_There’s More to Follow!_More stories of the sort you like; more, probably, by the author ofthis one; more than 500 titles all told by writers of world-widereputation, in the Authors’ Alphabetical List which you will findon the _reverse side_ of the wrapper of this book.

+Chapter INCIDENT AT THE WINDOW
+
+It chanced on Sunday, when Mr. Utterson was on his usual walk with Mr.
+
+Enfield, that their way lay once again through the by-street; and that
+
+when they came in front of the door, both stopped to gaze on it.
+
+�Well,� said Enfield, �that story�s at an end at least. We shall never
+
+see more of Mr. Hyde.�
+
+�I hope not,� said Utterson. �Did I ever tell you that I once saw him,
+
+and shared your feeling of repulsion?�
+
+�It was impossible to do the one without the other,� returned Enfield.
+
+�And by the way, what an ass you must have thought me, not to know that
+
+this was a back way to Dr. Jekyll�s! It was partly your own fault that
+
+I found it out, even when I did.�
+
+�So you found it out, did you?� said Utterson. �But if that be so, we
+
+may step into the court and take a look at the windows. To tell you the
+
+truth, I am uneasy about poor Jekyll; and even outside, I feel as if
+
+the presence of a friend might do him good.�
+
+The court was very cool and a little damp, and full of premature
+
+twilight, although the sky, high up overhead, was still bright with
+
+sunset. The middle one of the three windows was half-way open; and
+
+sitting close beside it, taking the air with an infinite sadness of
+
+mien, like some disconsolate prisoner, Utterson saw Dr. Jekyll.
+
+�What! Jekyll!� he cried. �I trust you are better.�
+
+�I am very low, Utterson,� replied the doctor drearily, �very low. It
+
+will not last long, thank God.�
+
+�You stay too much indoors,� said the lawyer. �You should be out,
+
+whipping up the circulation like Mr. Enfield and me. (This is my
+
+cousin�Mr. Enfield�Dr. Jekyll.) Come now; get your hat and take a quick
+
+turn with us.�
+
+�You are very good,� sighed the other. �I should like to very much; but
+
+no, no, no, it is quite impossible; I dare not. But indeed, Utterson, I
+
+am very glad to see you; this is really a great pleasure; I would ask
+
+you and Mr. Enfield up, but the place is really not fit.�
+
+�Why, then,� said the lawyer, good-naturedly, �the best thing we can do
+
+is to stay down here and speak with you from where we are.�
+
+�That is just what I was about to venture to propose,� returned the
+
+doctor with a smile. But the words were hardly uttered, before the
+
+smile was struck out of his face and succeeded by an expression of such
+
+abject terror and despair, as froze the very blood of the two gentlemen
+
+below. They saw it but for a glimpse for the window was instantly
+
+thrust down; but that glimpse had been sufficient, and they turned and
+
+left the court without a word. In silence, too, they traversed the
+
+by-street; and it was not until they had come into a neighbouring
+
+thoroughfare, where even upon a Sunday there were still some stirrings
+
+of life, that Mr. Utterson at last turned and looked at his companion.
+
+They were both pale; and there was an answering horror in their eyes.
+
+�God forgive us, God forgive us,� said Mr. Utterson.
+
+But Mr. Enfield only nodded his head very seriously, and walked on once
+
+more in silence.

+Chapter 14
+
+�Some time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends. It was
+
+one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding
+
+as it did a number of circumstances, each interesting and wonderful to
+
+one so utterly inexperienced as I was.
+
+�The name of the old man was De Lacey. He was descended from a good
+
+family in France, where he had lived for many years in affluence,
+
+respected by his superiors and beloved by his equals. His son was bred
+
+in the service of his country, and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the
+
+highest distinction. A few months before my arrival they had lived in
+
+a large and luxurious city called Paris, surrounded by friends and
+
+possessed of every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of intellect, or
+
+taste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford.
+
+�The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin. He was a
+
+Turkish merchant and had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for some
+
+reason which I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government.
+
+He was seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from
+
+Constantinople to join him. He was tried and condemned to death. The
+
+injustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant;
+
+and it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime
+
+alleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation.
+
+�Felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and
+
+indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the
+
+court. He made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him and then
+
+looked around for the means. After many fruitless attempts to gain
+
+admittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an
+
+unguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the
+
+unfortunate Muhammadan, who, loaded with chains, waited in despair the
+
+execution of the barbarous sentence. Felix visited the grate at night
+
+and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour. The Turk,
+
+amazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer
+
+by promises of reward and wealth. Felix rejected his offers with
+
+contempt, yet when he saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visit
+
+her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude, the
+
+youth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed
+
+a treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard.
+
+�The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made
+
+on the heart of Felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in
+
+his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he
+
+should be conveyed to a place of safety. Felix was too delicate to
+
+accept this offer, yet he looked forward to the probability of the
+
+event as to the consummation of his happiness.
+
+�During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for
+
+the escape of the merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several
+
+letters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to
+
+express her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old
+
+man, a servant of her father who understood French. She thanked him in
+
+the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent, and
+
+at the same time she gently deplored her own fate.
+
+�I have copies of these letters, for I found means, during my residence
+
+in the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters
+
+were often in the hands of Felix or Agatha. Before I depart I will
+
+give them to you; they will prove the truth of my tale; but at present,
+
+as the sun is already far declined, I shall only have time to repeat
+
+the substance of them to you.
+
+�Safie related that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and made a
+
+slave by the Turks; recommended by her beauty, she had won the heart of
+
+the father of Safie, who married her. The young girl spoke in high and
+
+enthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in freedom, spurned the
+
+bondage to which she was now reduced. She instructed her daughter in
+
+the tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of
+
+intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female
+
+followers of Muhammad. This lady died, but her lessons were indelibly
+
+impressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again
+
+returning to Asia and being immured within the walls of a harem,
+
+allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill-suited to
+
+the temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble
+
+emulation for virtue. The prospect of marrying a Christian and
+
+remaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in
+
+society was enchanting to her.
+
+�The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed, but on the night
+
+previous to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant
+
+many leagues from Paris. Felix had procured passports in the name of
+
+his father, sister, and himself. He had previously communicated his
+
+plan to the former, who aided the deceit by quitting his house, under
+
+the pretence of a journey and concealed himself, with his daughter, in
+
+an obscure part of Paris.
+
+�Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons and across Mont
+
+Cenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable
+
+opportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions.
+
+�Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his
+
+departure, before which time the Turk renewed his promise that she
+
+should be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in
+
+expectation of that event; and in the meantime he enjoyed the society
+
+of the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest
+
+affection. They conversed with one another through the means of an
+
+interpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and Safie
+
+sang to him the divine airs of her native country.
+
+�The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes
+
+of the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other
+
+plans. He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a
+
+Christian, but he feared the resentment of Felix if he should appear
+
+lukewarm, for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer
+
+if he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which they
+
+inhabited. He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled
+
+to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and
+
+secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed. His plans
+
+were facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris.
+
+�The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their
+
+victim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer. The
+
+plot of Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were
+
+thrown into prison. The news reached Felix and roused him from his
+
+dream of pleasure. His blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay
+
+in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of
+
+her whom he loved. This idea was torture to him. He quickly arranged
+
+with the Turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity
+
+for escape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a
+
+boarder at a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian,
+
+he hastened to Paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the
+
+law, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding.
+
+�He did not succeed. They remained confined for five months before the
+
+trial took place, the result of which deprived them of their fortune
+
+and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country.
+
+�They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where I
+
+discovered them. Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for
+
+whom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on
+
+discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin,
+
+became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted Italy with
+
+his daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money to aid him,
+
+as he said, in some plan of future maintenance.
+
+�Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix and rendered
+
+him, when I first saw him, the most miserable of his family. He could
+
+have endured poverty, and while this distress had been the meed of his
+
+virtue, he gloried in it; but the ingratitude of the Turk and the loss
+
+of his beloved Safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable. The
+
+arrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul.
+
+�When the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his wealth
+
+and rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her
+
+lover, but to prepare to return to her native country. The generous
+
+nature of Safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to
+
+expostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating his
+
+tyrannical mandate.
+
+�A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter�s apartment and told
+
+her hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn
+
+had been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the
+
+French government; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to
+
+Constantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours. He
+
+intended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential
+
+servant, to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his
+
+property, which had not yet arrived at Leghorn.
+
+�When alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it
+
+would become her to pursue in this emergency. A residence in Turkey
+
+was abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike averse
+
+to it. By some papers of her father which fell into her hands she
+
+heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where
+
+he then resided. She hesitated some time, but at length she formed her
+
+determination. Taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a
+
+sum of money, she quitted Italy with an attendant, a native of Leghorn,
+
+but who understood the common language of Turkey, and departed for
+
+Germany.
+
+�She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage
+
+of De Lacey, when her attendant fell dangerously ill. Safie nursed her
+
+with the most devoted affection, but the poor girl died, and the
+
+Arabian was left alone, unacquainted with the language of the country
+
+and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world. She fell, however,
+
+into good hands. The Italian had mentioned the name of the spot for
+
+which they were bound, and after her death the woman of the house in
+
+which they had lived took care that Safie should arrive in safety at
+
+the cottage of her lover.�

+Chapter 19
+
+London was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several
+
+months in this wonderful and celebrated city. Clerval desired the
+
+intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this
+
+time, but this was with me a secondary object; I was principally
+
+occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the
+
+completion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of
+
+introduction that I had brought with me, addressed to the most
+
+distinguished natural philosophers.
+
+If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness,
+
+it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure. But a blight had
+
+come over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of
+
+the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest
+
+was so terribly profound. Company was irksome to me; when alone, I
+
+could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of
+
+Henry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory
+
+peace. But busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair to
+
+my heart. I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my
+
+fellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and
+
+Justine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled
+
+my soul with anguish.
+
+But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive
+
+and anxious to gain experience and instruction. The difference of
+
+manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of
+
+instruction and amusement. He was also pursuing an object he had long
+
+had in view. His design was to visit India, in the belief that he had
+
+in his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had
+
+taken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of
+
+European colonization and trade. In Britain only could he further the
+
+execution of his plan. He was for ever busy, and the only check to his
+
+enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind. I tried to conceal this
+
+as much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures
+
+natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by
+
+any care or bitter recollection. I often refused to accompany him,
+
+alleging another engagement, that I might remain alone. I now also
+
+began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this
+
+was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling
+
+on the head. Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme
+
+anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips
+
+to quiver, and my heart to palpitate.
+
+After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in
+
+Scotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva. He mentioned the
+
+beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient
+
+allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth,
+
+where he resided. Clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation, and I,
+
+although I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams and
+
+all the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places.
+
+We had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now
+
+February. We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the
+
+north at the expiration of another month. In this expedition we did not
+
+intend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford,
+
+Matlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of
+
+this tour about the end of July. I packed up my chemical instruments and
+
+the materials I had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some
+
+obscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland.
+
+We quitted London on the 27th of March and remained a few days at
+
+Windsor, rambling in its beautiful forest. This was a new scene to us
+
+mountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of
+
+stately deer were all novelties to us.
+
+From thence we proceeded to Oxford. As we entered this city, our minds
+
+were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted
+
+there more than a century and a half before. It was here that Charles
+
+I. had collected his forces. This city had remained faithful to him,
+
+after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of
+
+Parliament and liberty. The memory of that unfortunate king and his
+
+companions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and
+
+son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they
+
+might be supposed to have inhabited. The spirit of elder days found a
+
+dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps. If these
+
+feelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of
+
+the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration.
+
+The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost
+
+magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows
+
+of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters,
+
+which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and
+
+domes, embosomed among aged trees.
+
+I enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the
+
+memory of the past and the anticipation of the future. I was formed
+
+for peaceful happiness. During my youthful days discontent never
+
+visited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by _ennui_, the sight of what
+
+is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in
+
+the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate
+
+elasticity to my spirits. But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has
+
+entered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what
+
+I shall soon cease to be�a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity,
+
+pitiable to others and intolerable to myself.
+
+We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs
+
+and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most
+
+animating epoch of English history. Our little voyages of discovery
+
+were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented
+
+themselves. We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the
+
+field on which that patriot fell. For a moment my soul was elevated
+
+from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas
+
+of liberty and self-sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments
+
+and the remembrancers. For an instant I dared to shake off my chains
+
+and look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten
+
+into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my
+
+miserable self.
+
+We left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next
+
+place of rest. The country in the neighbourhood of this village
+
+resembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but
+
+everything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of
+
+distant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my
+
+native country. We visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets
+
+of natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same
+
+manner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix. The latter name
+
+made me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit
+
+Matlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.
+
+From Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in
+
+Cumberland and Westmorland. I could now almost fancy myself among the
+
+Swiss mountains. The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the
+
+northern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the
+
+rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me. Here also we
+
+made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into
+
+happiness. The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than
+
+mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found
+
+in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have
+
+imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his
+
+inferiors. �I could pass my life here,� said he to me; �and among
+
+these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine.�
+
+But he found that a traveller�s life is one that includes much pain
+
+amidst its enjoyments. His feelings are for ever on the stretch; and
+
+when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit
+
+that on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again
+
+engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.
+
+We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland
+
+and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period
+
+of our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them
+
+to travel on. For my own part I was not sorry. I had now neglected my
+
+promise for some time, and I feared the effects of the d�mon�s
+
+disappointment. He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance
+
+on my relatives. This idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment
+
+from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace. I waited
+
+for my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was
+
+miserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and I
+
+saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to
+
+read and ascertain my fate. Sometimes I thought that the fiend
+
+followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion.
+
+When these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment,
+
+but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of
+
+his destroyer. I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the
+
+consciousness of which haunted me. I was guiltless, but I had indeed
+
+drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.
+
+I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might
+
+have interested the most unfortunate being. Clerval did not like it so well
+
+as Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him.
+
+But the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic
+
+castle and its environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthur�s
+
+Seat, St. Bernard�s Well, and the Pentland Hills, compensated him for
+
+the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration. But I was
+
+impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.
+
+We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrew�s, and
+
+along the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us.
+
+But I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into
+
+their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and
+
+accordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland
+
+alone. �Do you,� said I, �enjoy yourself, and let this be our
+
+rendezvous. I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with
+
+my motions, I entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short
+
+time; and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more
+
+congenial to your own temper.�
+
+Henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to
+
+remonstrate. He entreated me to write often. �I had rather be with
+
+you,� he said, �in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch
+
+people, whom I do not know; hasten, then, my dear friend, to return,
+
+that I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in
+
+your absence.�
+
+Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of
+
+Scotland and finish my work in solitude. I did not doubt but that the
+
+monster followed me and would discover himself to me when I should have
+
+finished, that he might receive his companion.
+
+With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of
+
+the remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours. It was a place
+
+fitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were
+
+continually beaten upon by the waves. The soil was barren, scarcely
+
+affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its
+
+inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs
+
+gave tokens of their miserable fare. Vegetables and bread, when they
+
+indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from
+
+the mainland, which was about five miles distant.
+
+On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of
+
+these was vacant when I arrived. This I hired. It contained but two
+
+rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable
+
+penury. The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the
+
+door was off its hinges. I ordered it to be repaired, bought some
+
+furniture, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless have
+
+occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been
+
+benumbed by want and squalid poverty. As it was, I lived ungazed at
+
+and unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes
+
+which I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations
+
+of men.
+
+In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening,
+
+when the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea to
+
+listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet. It was a
+
+monotonous yet ever-changing scene. I thought of Switzerland; it was
+
+far different from this desolate and appalling landscape. Its hills
+
+are covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the
+
+plains. Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when
+
+troubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively
+
+infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean.
+
+In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, but
+
+as I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and
+
+irksome to me. Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my
+
+laboratory for several days, and at other times I toiled day and night
+
+in order to complete my work. It was, indeed, a filthy process in
+
+which I was engaged. During my first experiment, a kind of
+
+enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my
+
+mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes
+
+were shut to the horror of my proceedings. But now I went to it in
+
+cold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands.
+
+Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in
+
+a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from
+
+the actual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I
+
+grew restless and nervous. Every moment I feared to meet my
+
+persecutor. Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing
+
+to raise them lest they should encounter the object which I so much
+
+dreaded to behold. I feared to wander from the sight of my fellow
+
+creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion.
+
+In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably
+
+advanced. I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager
+
+hope, which I dared not trust myself to question but which was
+
+intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken
+
+in my bosom.

+Chapter 4
+
+From this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the
+
+most comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation.
+
+I read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination,
+
+which modern inquirers have written on these subjects. I attended the
+
+lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the
+
+university, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense
+
+and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive
+
+physiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable. In
+
+M. Waldman I found a true friend. His gentleness was never tinged by
+
+dogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and
+
+good nature that banished every idea of pedantry. In a thousand ways
+
+he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse
+
+inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension. My application was at
+
+first fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and
+
+soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the
+
+light of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.
+
+As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress
+
+was rapid. My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and
+
+my proficiency that of the masters. Professor Krempe often asked me,
+
+with a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman
+
+expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress. Two years
+
+passed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was
+
+engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I
+
+hoped to make. None but those who have experienced them can conceive
+
+of the enticements of science. In other studies you go as far as
+
+others have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in
+
+a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.
+
+A mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must
+
+infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who
+
+continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was
+
+solely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two
+
+years I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical
+
+instruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the
+
+university. When I had arrived at this point and had become as well
+
+acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as
+
+depended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my
+
+residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought
+
+of returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident
+
+happened that protracted my stay.
+
+One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was
+
+the structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with
+
+life. Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?
+
+It was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a
+
+mystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming
+
+acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our
+
+inquiries. I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined
+
+thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of
+
+natural philosophy which relate to physiology. Unless I had been
+
+animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this
+
+study would have been irksome and almost intolerable. To examine the
+
+causes of life, we must first have recourse to death. I became
+
+acquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I
+
+must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body.
+
+In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my
+
+mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do not ever
+
+remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared
+
+the apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and
+
+a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of
+
+life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become
+
+food for the worm. Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of
+
+this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and
+
+charnel-houses. My attention was fixed upon every object the most
+
+insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. I saw how the
+
+fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of
+
+death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm
+
+inherited the wonders of the eye and brain. I paused, examining and
+
+analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change
+
+from life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this
+
+darkness a sudden light broke in upon me�a light so brilliant and
+
+wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity
+
+of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so
+
+many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same
+
+science, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a
+
+secret.
+
+Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. The sun does not
+
+more certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is
+
+true. Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the
+
+discovery were distinct and probable. After days and nights of
+
+incredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of
+
+generation and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing
+
+animation upon lifeless matter.
+
+The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery
+
+soon gave place to delight and rapture. After so much time spent in
+
+painful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the
+
+most gratifying consummation of my toils. But this discovery was so
+
+great and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been
+
+progressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result.
+
+What had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation
+
+of the world was now within my grasp. Not that, like a magic scene, it
+
+all opened upon me at once: the information I had obtained was of a
+
+nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them
+
+towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already
+
+accomplished. I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead
+
+and found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly
+
+ineffectual light.
+
+I see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes
+
+express, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with
+
+which I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end
+
+of my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that
+
+subject. I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was,
+
+to your destruction and infallible misery. Learn from me, if not by my
+
+precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of
+
+knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town
+
+to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature
+
+will allow.
+
+When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated
+
+a long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it.
+
+Although I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to
+
+prepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of
+
+fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable
+
+difficulty and labour. I doubted at first whether I should attempt the
+
+creation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my
+
+imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to
+
+doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful
+
+as man. The materials at present within my command hardly appeared
+
+adequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should
+
+ultimately succeed. I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my
+
+operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be
+
+imperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes
+
+place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present
+
+attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success. Nor
+
+could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any
+
+argument of its impracticability. It was with these feelings that I
+
+began the creation of a human being. As the minuteness of the parts
+
+formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first
+
+intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say,
+
+about eight feet in height, and proportionably large. After having
+
+formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully
+
+collecting and arranging my materials, I began.
+
+No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like
+
+a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success. Life and death
+
+appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and
+
+pour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new species would bless
+
+me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would
+
+owe their being to me. No father could claim the gratitude of his
+
+child so completely as I should deserve theirs. Pursuing these
+
+reflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless
+
+matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible)
+
+renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.
+
+These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking
+
+with unremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale with study, and my
+
+person had become emaciated with confinement. Sometimes, on the very
+
+brink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the
+
+next day or the next hour might realise. One secret which I alone
+
+possessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon
+
+gazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless
+
+eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places. Who shall conceive
+
+the horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps
+
+of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless
+
+clay? My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but
+
+then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed
+
+to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit. It was
+
+indeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed
+
+acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had
+
+returned to my old habits. I collected bones from charnel-houses and
+
+disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human
+
+frame. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house,
+
+and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase,
+
+I kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from
+
+their sockets in attending to the details of my employment. The
+
+dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials;
+
+and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation,
+
+whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I
+
+brought my work near to a conclusion.
+
+The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in
+
+one pursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields
+
+bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant
+
+vintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature. And the
+
+same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also
+
+to forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had
+
+not seen for so long a time. I knew my silence disquieted them, and I
+
+well remembered the words of my father: �I know that while you are
+
+pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall
+
+hear regularly from you. You must pardon me if I regard any
+
+interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties
+
+are equally neglected.�
+
+I knew well therefore what would be my father�s feelings, but I could
+
+not tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which
+
+had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination. I wished, as it
+
+were, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection
+
+until the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature,
+
+should be completed.
+
+I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect
+
+to vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was
+
+justified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from
+
+blame. A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and
+
+peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to
+
+disturb his tranquillity. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge
+
+is an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply yourself
+
+has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for
+
+those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that
+
+study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human
+
+mind. If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit
+
+whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic
+
+affections, Greece had not been enslaved, C�sar would have spared his
+
+country, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the
+
+empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.
+
+But I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my
+
+tale, and your looks remind me to proceed.
+
+My father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my
+
+silence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before.
+
+Winter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not
+
+watch the blossom or the expanding leaves�sights which before always
+
+yielded me supreme delight�so deeply was I engrossed in my
+
+occupation. The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near
+
+to a close, and now every day showed me more plainly how well I had
+
+succeeded. But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared
+
+rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other
+
+unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment.
+
+Every night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most
+
+painful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow
+
+creatures as if I had been guilty of a crime. Sometimes I grew alarmed at
+
+the wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose alone
+
+sustained me: my labours would soon end, and I believed that exercise and
+
+amusement would then drive away incipient disease; and I promised myself
+
+both of these when my creation should be complete.

+Chapter 10
+
+I spent the following day roaming through the valley. I stood beside
+
+the sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that
+
+with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to
+
+barricade the valley. The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before
+
+me; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were
+
+scattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious
+
+presence-chamber of imperial Nature was broken only by the brawling
+
+waves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the
+
+avalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the
+
+accumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws,
+
+was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in
+
+their hands. These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the
+
+greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving. They elevated me
+
+from all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove my
+
+grief, they subdued and tranquillised it. In some degree, also, they
+
+diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the
+
+last month. I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were,
+
+waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I
+
+had contemplated during the day. They congregated round me; the
+
+unstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods,
+
+and ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds�they all
+
+gathered round me and bade me be at peace.
+
+Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke? All of
+
+soul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every
+
+thought. The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the
+
+summits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of those
+
+mighty friends. Still I would penetrate their misty veil and seek them
+
+in their cloudy retreats. What were rain and storm to me? My mule was
+
+brought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of
+
+Montanvert. I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous
+
+and ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it.
+
+It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the
+
+soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy.
+
+The sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the
+
+effect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget the passing
+
+cares of life. I determined to go without a guide, for I was well
+
+acquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy the
+
+solitary grandeur of the scene.
+
+The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short
+
+windings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the
+
+mountain. It is a scene terrifically desolate. In a thousand spots
+
+the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie
+
+broken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent,
+
+leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon
+
+other trees. The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines
+
+of snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is
+
+particularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking
+
+in a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw
+
+destruction upon the head of the speaker. The pines are not tall or
+
+luxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene.
+
+I looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers
+
+which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite
+
+mountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain
+
+poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression I
+
+received from the objects around me. Alas! Why does man boast of
+
+sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders
+
+them more necessary beings. If our impulses were confined to hunger,
+
+thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by
+
+every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may
+
+convey to us.
+
+We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.
+
+We rise; one wand�ring thought pollutes the day.
+
+We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,
+
+Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;
+
+It is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow,
+
+The path of its departure still is free.
+
+Man�s yesterday may ne�er be like his morrow;
+
+Nought may endure but mutability!
+
+It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent. For some
+
+time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. A mist covered
+
+both that and the surrounding mountains. Presently a breeze dissipated
+
+the cloud, and I descended upon the glacier. The surface is very
+
+uneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and
+
+interspersed by rifts that sink deep. The field of ice is almost a
+
+league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it. The
+
+opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock. From the side where I
+
+now stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league;
+
+and above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty. I remained in a recess
+
+of the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene. The sea,
+
+or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains,
+
+whose aerial summits hung over its recesses. Their icy and glittering
+
+peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds. My heart, which was
+
+before sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed,
+
+�Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow
+
+beds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion,
+
+away from the joys of life.�
+
+As I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance,
+
+advancing towards me with superhuman speed. He bounded over the
+
+crevices in the ice, among which I had walked with caution; his
+
+stature, also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that of man. I was
+
+troubled; a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me,
+
+but I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains. I
+
+perceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred!)
+
+that it was the wretch whom I had created. I trembled with rage and
+
+horror, resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in
+
+mortal combat. He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish,
+
+combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness
+
+rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes. But I scarcely
+
+observed this; rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance,
+
+and I recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious
+
+detestation and contempt.
+
+�Devil,� I exclaimed, �do you dare approach me? And do
+
+not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head?
+
+Begone, vile insect! Or rather, stay, that I may trample you to dust! And,
+
+oh! That I could, with the extinction of your miserable existence, restore
+
+those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered!�
+
+�I expected this reception,� said the d�mon. �All men hate the
+
+wretched; how, then, must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all
+
+living things! Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature,
+
+to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of
+
+one of us. You purpose to kill me. How dare you sport thus with life?
+
+Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of
+
+mankind. If you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and
+
+you at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it
+
+be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends.�
+
+�Abhorred monster! Fiend that thou art! The tortures of hell are too
+
+mild a vengeance for thy crimes. Wretched devil! You reproach me with
+
+your creation, come on, then, that I may extinguish the spark which I
+
+so negligently bestowed.�
+
+My rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the
+
+feelings which can arm one being against the existence of another.
+
+He easily eluded me and said,
+
+�Be calm! I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred
+
+on my devoted head. Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to
+
+increase my misery? Life, although it may only be an accumulation of
+
+anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it. Remember, thou hast made
+
+me more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine, my
+
+joints more supple. But I will not be tempted to set myself in
+
+opposition to thee. I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and
+
+docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part,
+
+the which thou owest me. Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every
+
+other and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy
+
+clemency and affection, is most due. Remember that I am thy creature;
+
+I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou
+
+drivest from joy for no misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from which I
+
+alone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery made
+
+me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.�
+
+�Begone! I will not hear you. There can be no community between you
+
+and me; we are enemies. Begone, or let us try our strength in a fight,
+
+in which one must fall.�
+
+�How can I move thee? Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a
+
+favourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and
+
+compassion? Believe me, Frankenstein, I was benevolent; my soul glowed
+
+with love and humanity; but am I not alone, miserably alone? You, my
+
+creator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures,
+
+who owe me nothing? They spurn and hate me. The desert mountains and
+
+dreary glaciers are my refuge. I have wandered here many days; the
+
+caves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the
+
+only one which man does not grudge. These bleak skies I hail, for they
+
+are kinder to me than your fellow beings. If the multitude of mankind
+
+knew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for
+
+my destruction. Shall I not then hate them who abhor me? I will keep
+
+no terms with my enemies. I am miserable, and they shall share my
+
+wretchedness. Yet it is in your power to recompense me, and deliver
+
+them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that
+
+not only you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be
+
+swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage. Let your compassion be
+
+moved, and do not disdain me. Listen to my tale; when you have heard
+
+that, abandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge that I deserve.
+
+But hear me. The guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they
+
+are, to speak in their own defence before they are condemned. Listen
+
+to me, Frankenstein. You accuse me of murder, and yet you would, with
+
+a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature. Oh, praise the
+
+eternal justice of man! Yet I ask you not to spare me; listen to me,
+
+and then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your hands.�
+
+�Why do you call to my remembrance,� I rejoined, �circumstances of
+
+which I shudder to reflect, that I have been the miserable origin and
+
+author? Cursed be the day, abhorred devil, in which you first saw
+
+light! Cursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that formed you!
+
+You have made me wretched beyond expression. You have left me no power
+
+to consider whether I am just to you or not. Begone! Relieve me from
+
+the sight of your detested form.�
+
+�Thus I relieve thee, my creator,� he said, and placed his hated hands
+
+before my eyes, which I flung from me with violence; �thus I take from
+
+thee a sight which you abhor. Still thou canst listen to me and grant
+
+me thy compassion. By the virtues that I once possessed, I demand this
+
+from you. Hear my tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature of
+
+this place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut upon
+
+the mountain. The sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descends
+
+to hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another
+
+world, you will have heard my story and can decide. On you it rests,
+
+whether I quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless
+
+life, or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of
+
+your own speedy ruin.�
+
+As he said this he led the way across the ice; I followed. My heart
+
+was full, and I did not answer him, but as I proceeded, I weighed the
+
+various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to
+
+his tale. I was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my
+
+resolution. I had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my
+
+brother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion.
+
+For the first time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator towards
+
+his creature were, and that I ought to render him happy before I
+
+complained of his wickedness. These motives urged me to comply with
+
+his demand. We crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite
+
+rock. The air was cold, and the rain again began to descend; we
+
+entered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavy
+
+heart and depressed spirits. But I consented to listen, and seating
+
+myself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began
+
+his tale.

+Chapter 8
+
+We passed a few sad hours until eleven o�clock, when the trial was to
+
+commence. My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend
+
+as witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. During the whole of
+
+this wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture. It was to
+
+be decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would
+
+cause the death of two of my fellow beings: one a smiling babe full of
+
+innocence and joy, the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every
+
+aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.
+
+Justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised
+
+to render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an
+
+ignominious grave, and I the cause! A thousand times rather would I
+
+have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I
+
+was absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have
+
+been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have
+
+exculpated her who suffered through me.
+
+The appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning, and
+
+her countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her
+
+feelings, exquisitely beautiful. Yet she appeared confident in
+
+innocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by
+
+thousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have
+
+excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the
+
+imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed. She
+
+was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as
+
+her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she
+
+worked up her mind to an appearance of courage. When she entered the
+
+court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were
+
+seated. A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly
+
+recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest
+
+her utter guiltlessness.
+
+The trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the
+
+charge, several witnesses were called. Several strange facts combined
+
+against her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof
+
+of her innocence as I had. She had been out the whole of the night on
+
+which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been
+
+perceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the
+
+murdered child had been afterwards found. The woman asked her what she
+
+did there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused
+
+and unintelligible answer. She returned to the house about eight
+
+o�clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she
+
+replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly
+
+if anything had been heard concerning him. When shown the body, she
+
+fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days. The
+
+picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket;
+
+and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same
+
+which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round
+
+his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.
+
+Justine was called on for her defence. As the trial had proceeded, her
+
+countenance had altered. Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly
+
+expressed. Sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was
+
+desired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible
+
+although variable voice.
+
+�God knows,� she said, �how entirely I am innocent. But I
+
+do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me; I rest my innocence
+
+on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced
+
+against me, and I hope the character I have always borne will incline my
+
+judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears
+
+doubtful or suspicious.�
+
+She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed
+
+the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the
+
+house of an aunt at Ch�ne, a village situated at about a league from
+
+Geneva. On her return, at about nine o�clock, she met a man who asked
+
+her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost. She was
+
+alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him,
+
+when the gates of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain
+
+several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being
+
+unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known. Most
+
+of the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that
+
+she slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke.
+
+It was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour
+
+to find my brother. If she had gone near the spot where his body lay,
+
+it was without her knowledge. That she had been bewildered when
+
+questioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed
+
+a sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain.
+
+Concerning the picture she could give no account.
+
+�I know,� continued the unhappy victim, �how heavily and
+
+fatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of
+
+explaining it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left
+
+to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been
+
+placed in my pocket. But here also I am checked. I believe that I have no
+
+enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me
+
+wantonly. Did the murderer place it there? I know of no opportunity
+
+afforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why should he have stolen the
+
+jewel, to part with it again so soon?
+
+�I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for
+
+hope. I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my
+
+character, and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed
+
+guilt, I must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my
+
+innocence.�
+
+Several witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and
+
+they spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which they
+
+supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come
+
+forward. Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent
+
+dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused,
+
+when, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address
+
+the court.
+
+�I am,� said she, �the cousin of the unhappy child who
+
+was murdered, or rather his sister, for I was educated by and have lived
+
+with his parents ever since and even long before his birth. It may
+
+therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion, but
+
+when I see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her
+
+pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I
+
+know of her character. I am well acquainted with the accused. I have lived
+
+in the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearly
+
+two years. During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and
+
+benevolent of human creatures. She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in
+
+her last illness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwards
+
+attended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited
+
+the admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in my
+
+uncle�s house, where she was beloved by all the family. She was
+
+warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a
+
+most affectionate mother. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that,
+
+notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely
+
+on her perfect innocence. She had no temptation for such an action; as to
+
+the bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it,
+
+I should have willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem and value
+
+her.�
+
+A murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth�s simple and powerful
+
+appeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in
+
+favour of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with
+
+renewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude. She
+
+herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer. My own
+
+agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial. I believed
+
+in her innocence; I knew it. Could the d�mon who had (I did not for a
+
+minute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have
+
+betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy? I could not sustain the
+
+horror of my situation, and when I perceived that the popular voice and
+
+the countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim,
+
+I rushed out of the court in agony. The tortures of the accused did
+
+not equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of
+
+remorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold.
+
+I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. In the morning I went to
+
+the court; my lips and throat were parched. I dared not ask the fatal
+
+question, but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my
+
+visit. The ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine
+
+was condemned.
+
+I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. I had before
+
+experienced sensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to bestow upon
+
+them adequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the
+
+heart-sickening despair that I then endured. The person to whom I
+
+addressed myself added that Justine had already confessed her guilt.
+
+�That evidence,� he observed, �was hardly required in so glaring a
+
+case, but I am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our judges like to
+
+condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so
+
+decisive.�
+
+This was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean? Had
+
+my eyes deceived me? And was I really as mad as the whole world would
+
+believe me to be if I disclosed the object of my suspicions? I
+
+hastened to return home, and Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result.
+
+�My cousin,� replied I, �it is decided as you may have expected; all
+
+judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty
+
+should escape. But she has confessed.�
+
+This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon
+
+Justine�s innocence. �Alas!� said she. �How shall I
+
+ever again believe in human goodness? Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as
+
+my sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray?
+
+Her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and yet she has
+
+committed a murder.�
+
+Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my
+
+cousin. My father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own
+
+judgment and feelings to decide. �Yes,� said Elizabeth,
+
+�I will go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany
+
+me; I cannot go alone.� The idea of this visit was torture to me, yet
+
+I could not refuse.
+
+We entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld Justine sitting on some
+
+straw at the farther end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested on
+
+her knees. She rose on seeing us enter, and when we were left alone with
+
+her, she threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly. My
+
+cousin wept also.
+
+�Oh, Justine!� said she. �Why did you rob me of my last consolation?
+
+I relied on your innocence, and although I was then very wretched, I
+
+was not so miserable as I am now.�
+
+�And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked? Do you also
+
+join with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer?� Her
+
+voice was suffocated with sobs.
+
+�Rise, my poor girl,� said Elizabeth; �why do you kneel,
+
+if you are innocent? I am not one of your enemies, I believed you
+
+guiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you had
+
+yourself declared your guilt. That report, you say, is false; and be
+
+assured, dear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a
+
+moment, but your own confession.�
+
+�I did confess, but I confessed a lie. I confessed, that I might
+
+obtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than
+
+all my other sins. The God of heaven forgive me! Ever since I was
+
+condemned, my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced,
+
+until I almost began to think that I was the monster that he said I
+
+was. He threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if
+
+I continued obdurate. Dear lady, I had none to support me; all looked
+
+on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition. What could I do?
+
+In an evil hour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly
+
+miserable.�
+
+She paused, weeping, and then continued, �I thought with horror, my
+
+sweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom your blessed
+
+aunt had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capable
+
+of a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated.
+
+Dear William! dearest blessed child! I soon shall see you again in
+
+heaven, where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as I
+
+am to suffer ignominy and death.�
+
+�Oh, Justine! Forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you.
+
+Why did you confess? But do not mourn, dear girl. Do not fear. I
+
+will proclaim, I will prove your innocence. I will melt the stony
+
+hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers. You shall not die!
+
+You, my playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold!
+
+No! No! I never could survive so horrible a misfortune.�
+
+Justine shook her head mournfully. �I do not fear to die,� she said;
+
+�that pang is past. God raises my weakness and gives me courage to
+
+endure the worst. I leave a sad and bitter world; and if you remember
+
+me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, I am resigned to the
+
+fate awaiting me. Learn from me, dear lady, to submit in patience to
+
+the will of heaven!�
+
+During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison room,
+
+where I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me. Despair!
+
+Who dared talk of that? The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass
+
+the awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as I did, such
+
+deep and bitter agony. I gnashed my teeth and ground them together,
+
+uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul. Justine started. When
+
+she saw who it was, she approached me and said, �Dear sir, you are very
+
+kind to visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am guilty?�
+
+I could not answer. �No, Justine,� said Elizabeth; �he is more
+
+convinced of your innocence than I was, for even when he heard that you
+
+had confessed, he did not credit it.�
+
+�I truly thank him. In these last moments I feel the sincerest
+
+gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness. How sweet is
+
+the affection of others to such a wretch as I am! It removes more than
+
+half my misfortune, and I feel as if I could die in peace now that my
+
+innocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin.�
+
+Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself. She indeed
+
+gained the resignation she desired. But I, the true murderer, felt the
+
+never-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or
+
+consolation. Elizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was
+
+the misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair
+
+moon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness. Anguish and
+
+despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within
+
+me which nothing could extinguish. We stayed several hours with
+
+Justine, and it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear
+
+herself away. �I wish,� cried she, �that I were to die with you; I
+
+cannot live in this world of misery.�
+
+Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty
+
+repressed her bitter tears. She embraced Elizabeth and said in a voice
+
+of half-suppressed emotion, �Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth,
+
+my beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and
+
+preserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever
+
+suffer! Live, and be happy, and make others so.�
+
+And on the morrow Justine died. Elizabeth�s heart-rending eloquence
+
+failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the
+
+criminality of the saintly sufferer. My passionate and indignant
+
+appeals were lost upon them. And when I received their cold answers
+
+and heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed
+
+avowal died away on my lips. Thus I might proclaim myself a madman,
+
+but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim. She
+
+perished on the scaffold as a murderess!
+
+From the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and
+
+voiceless grief of my Elizabeth. This also was my doing! And my
+
+father�s woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was
+
+the work of my thrice-accursed hands! Ye weep, unhappy ones, but these
+
+are not your last tears! Again shall you raise the funeral wail, and
+
+the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard!
+
+Frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he
+
+who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no
+
+thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear
+
+countenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life
+
+in serving you�he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond
+
+his hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction
+
+pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments!
+
+Thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair,
+
+I beheld those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William and
+
+Justine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts.

+Chapter 23
+
+It was eight o�clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the
+
+shore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn and
+
+contemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured
+
+in darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines.
+
+The wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence
+
+in the west. The moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was
+
+beginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the
+
+flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the
+
+scene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves
+
+that were beginning to rise. Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended.
+
+I had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured the
+
+shapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind. I was anxious
+
+and watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in
+
+my bosom; every sound terrified me, but I resolved that I would sell my
+
+life dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that
+
+of my adversary was extinguished.
+
+Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence,
+
+but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, and
+
+trembling, she asked, �What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor?
+
+What is it you fear?�
+
+�Oh! Peace, peace, my love,� replied I; �this night, and
+
+all will be safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful.�
+
+I passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how
+
+fearful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife,
+
+and I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her
+
+until I had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy.
+
+She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages
+
+of the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to
+
+my adversary. But I discovered no trace of him and was beginning to
+
+conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the
+
+execution of his menaces when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful
+
+scream. It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired. As I
+
+heard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the
+
+motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the blood
+
+trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs. This
+
+state lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed
+
+into the room.
+
+Great God! Why did I not then expire! Why am I here to relate the
+
+destruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth? She was
+
+there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down
+
+and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair. Everywhere I
+
+turn I see the same figure�her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung
+
+by the murderer on its bridal bier. Could I behold this and live? Alas!
+
+Life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated. For a moment
+
+only did I lose recollection; I fell senseless on the ground.
+
+When I recovered I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; their
+
+countenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of others
+
+appeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me. I
+
+escaped from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my
+
+wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy. She had been moved from the
+
+posture in which I had first beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head upon
+
+her arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have
+
+supposed her asleep. I rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour, but
+
+the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what I now held
+
+in my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished.
+
+The murderous mark of the fiend�s grasp was on her neck, and the
+
+breath had ceased to issue from her lips.
+
+While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up.
+
+The windows of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind of
+
+panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber.
+
+The shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to be
+
+described, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred.
+
+A grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his
+
+fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife. I rushed towards
+
+the window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me,
+
+leaped from his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning,
+
+plunged into the lake.
+
+The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. I pointed to
+
+the spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with
+
+boats; nets were cast, but in vain. After passing several hours, we
+
+returned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a
+
+form conjured up by my fancy. After having landed, they proceeded to
+
+search the country, parties going in different directions among the
+
+woods and vines.
+
+I attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the
+
+house, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken
+
+man, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my
+
+eyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of fever. In this state I
+
+was carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had
+
+happened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that
+
+I had lost.
+
+After an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room
+
+where the corpse of my beloved lay. There were women weeping around; I
+
+hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no
+
+distinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to
+
+various subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their
+
+cause. I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror. The death
+
+of William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly
+
+of my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining
+
+friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now
+
+might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his
+
+feet. This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action. I started
+
+up and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.
+
+There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the
+
+wind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents. However, it was
+
+hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night. I hired men
+
+to row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from
+
+mental torment in bodily exercise. But the overflowing misery I now felt,
+
+and the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any
+
+exertion. I threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way
+
+to every gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up, I saw scenes which were
+
+familiar to me in my happier time and which I had contemplated but the day
+
+before in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection.
+
+Tears streamed from my eyes. The rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw
+
+the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had
+
+then been observed by Elizabeth. Nothing is so painful to the human mind as
+
+a great and sudden change. The sun might shine or the clouds might lower,
+
+but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before. A fiend had
+
+snatched from me every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever been
+
+so miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of
+
+man.
+
+But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last
+
+overwhelming event? Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their
+
+_acme_, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you. Know
+
+that, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate. My
+
+own strength is exhausted, and I must tell, in a few words, what remains of
+
+my hideous narration.
+
+I arrived at Geneva. My father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunk
+
+under the tidings that I bore. I see him now, excellent and venerable old
+
+man! His eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their
+
+delight�his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with
+
+all that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, having
+
+few affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain. Cursed, cursed
+
+be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste
+
+in wretchedness! He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated
+
+around him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable to
+
+rise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms.
+
+What then became of me? I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and
+
+darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me. Sometimes,
+
+indeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales
+
+with the friends of my youth, but I awoke and found myself in a
+
+dungeon. Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear
+
+conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my
+
+prison. For they had called me mad, and during many months, as I
+
+understood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.
+
+Liberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as I
+
+awakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge. As the
+
+memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their
+
+cause�the monster whom I had created, the miserable d�mon whom I had
+
+sent abroad into the world for my destruction. I was possessed by a
+
+maddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed
+
+that I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal
+
+revenge on his cursed head.
+
+Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to
+
+reflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about
+
+a month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town
+
+and told him that I had an accusation to make, that I knew the
+
+destroyer of my family, and that I required him to exert his whole
+
+authority for the apprehension of the murderer.
+
+The magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness. �Be
+
+assured, sir,� said he, �no pains or exertions on my part shall
+
+be spared to discover the villain.�
+
+�I thank you,� replied I; �listen, therefore, to the
+
+deposition that I have to make. It is indeed a tale so strange that I
+
+should fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth
+
+which, however wonderful, forces conviction. The story is too connected to
+
+be mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood.� My
+
+manner as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had formed in my
+
+own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purpose
+
+quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life. I now related
+
+my history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with
+
+accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation.
+
+The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued
+
+he became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with
+
+horror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted
+
+on his countenance.
+
+When I had concluded my narration, I said, �This is the being whom I
+
+accuse and for whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your
+
+whole power. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that
+
+your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those
+
+functions on this occasion.�
+
+This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own
+
+auditor. He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given
+
+to a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon
+
+to act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity
+
+returned. He, however, answered mildly, �I would willingly afford you
+
+every aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to
+
+have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. Who can follow an
+
+animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where
+
+no man would venture to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed since
+
+the commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he
+
+has wandered or what region he may now inhabit.�
+
+�I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, and if
+
+he has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois
+
+and destroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive your thoughts; you do not
+
+credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the
+
+punishment which is his desert.�
+
+As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated.
+
+�You are mistaken,� said he. �I will exert myself, and if
+
+it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer
+
+punishment proportionate to his crimes. But I fear, from what you have
+
+yourself described to be his properties, that this will prove
+
+impracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you should
+
+make up your mind to disappointment.�
+
+�That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail. My
+
+revenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I
+
+confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul. My rage
+
+is unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned
+
+loose upon society, still exists. You refuse my just demand; I have
+
+but one resource, and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to
+
+his destruction.�
+
+I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzy
+
+in my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness
+
+which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed. But to a Genevan
+
+magistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of
+
+devotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of
+
+madness. He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and
+
+reverted to my tale as the effects of delirium.
+
+�Man,� I cried, �how ignorant art thou in thy pride of
+
+wisdom! Cease; you know not what it is you say.�
+
+I broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on
+
+some other mode of action.

+Chapter 13
+
+�I now hasten to the more moving part of my story. I shall relate
+
+events that impressed me with feelings which, from what I had been,
+
+have made me what I am.
+
+�Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine and the skies
+
+cloudless. It surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy
+
+should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure. My
+
+senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and
+
+a thousand sights of beauty.
+
+�It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested
+
+from labour�the old man played on his guitar, and the children
+
+listened to him�that I observed the countenance of Felix was
+
+melancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently, and once his father
+
+paused in his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired
+
+the cause of his son�s sorrow. Felix replied in a cheerful accent, and
+
+the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door.
+
+�It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a guide.
+
+The lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black
+
+veil. Agatha asked a question, to which the stranger only replied by
+
+pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix. Her voice was
+
+musical but unlike that of either of my friends. On hearing this word,
+
+Felix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her
+
+veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression. Her
+
+hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were
+
+dark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular
+
+proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with
+
+a lovely pink.
+
+�Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of
+
+sorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of
+
+ecstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his
+
+eyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I
+
+thought him as beautiful as the stranger. She appeared affected by
+
+different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held
+
+out her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously and called her, as
+
+well as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian. She did not appear to
+
+understand him, but smiled. He assisted her to dismount, and
+
+dismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage. Some
+
+conversation took place between him and his father, and the young
+
+stranger knelt at the old man�s feet and would have kissed his hand,
+
+but he raised her and embraced her affectionately.
+
+�I soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds
+
+and appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood
+
+by nor herself understood the cottagers. They made many signs which I
+
+did not comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness
+
+through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the
+
+morning mists. Felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of
+
+delight welcomed his Arabian. Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed
+
+the hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to her brother, made
+
+signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she
+
+came. Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances,
+
+expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend. Presently I
+
+found, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger
+
+repeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language;
+
+and the idea instantly occurred to me that I should make use of the
+
+same instructions to the same end. The stranger learned about twenty
+
+words at the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those which I had
+
+before understood, but I profited by the others.
+
+�As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early. When they
+
+separated Felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said, �Good night
+
+sweet Safie.� He sat up much longer, conversing with his father, and
+
+by the frequent repetition of her name I conjectured that their lovely
+
+guest was the subject of their conversation. I ardently desired to
+
+understand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found
+
+it utterly impossible.
+
+�The next morning Felix went out to his work, and after the usual
+
+occupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the
+
+old man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly
+
+beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my
+
+eyes. She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or
+
+dying away like a nightingale of the woods.
+
+�When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at first
+
+declined it. She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in
+
+sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. The old
+
+man appeared enraptured and said some words which Agatha endeavoured to
+
+explain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she
+
+bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.
+
+�The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration
+
+that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends.
+
+Safie was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the
+
+knowledge of language, so that in two months I began to comprehend most
+
+of the words uttered by my protectors.
+
+�In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and
+
+the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the
+
+scent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods;
+
+the sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal
+
+rambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably
+
+shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun, for I never
+
+ventured abroad during daylight, fearful of meeting with the same
+
+treatment I had formerly endured in the first village which I entered.
+
+�My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily
+
+master the language; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than
+
+the Arabian, who understood very little and conversed in broken
+
+accents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word that
+
+was spoken.
+
+�While I improved in speech, I also learned the science of letters as
+
+it was taught to the stranger, and this opened before me a wide field
+
+for wonder and delight.
+
+�The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney�s _Ruins
+
+of Empires_. I should not have understood the purport of this book had not
+
+Felix, in reading it, given very minute explanations. He had chosen this
+
+work, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the
+
+Eastern authors. Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history
+
+and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave
+
+me an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the different
+
+nations of the earth. I heard of the slothful Asiatics, of the stupendous
+
+genius and mental activity of the Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue
+
+of the early Romans�of their subsequent degenerating�of the
+
+decline of that mighty empire, of chivalry, Christianity, and kings. I heard
+
+of the discovery of the American hemisphere and wept with Safie over the
+
+hapless fate of its original inhabitants.
+
+�These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. Was
+
+man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so
+
+vicious and base? He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil
+
+principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and
+
+godlike. To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour
+
+that can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on
+
+record have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more
+
+abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm. For a long time I
+
+could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or
+
+even why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of
+
+vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and
+
+loathing.
+
+�Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me.
+
+While I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the
+
+Arabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me. I
+
+heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid
+
+poverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood.
+
+�The words induced me to turn towards myself. I learned that the
+
+possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and
+
+unsullied descent united with riches. A man might be respected with
+
+only one of these advantages, but without either he was considered,
+
+except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to
+
+waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few! And what was I? Of
+
+my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew that I
+
+possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. I was, besides,
+
+endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even
+
+of the same nature as man. I was more agile than they and could
+
+subsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with
+
+less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs. When I looked
+
+around I saw and heard of none like me. Was I, then, a monster, a blot
+
+upon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?
+
+�I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted
+
+upon me; I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with
+
+knowledge. Oh, that I had for ever remained in my native wood, nor
+
+known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat!
+
+�Of what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings to the mind when it
+
+has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock. I wished sometimes to
+
+shake off all thought and feeling, but I learned that there was but one
+
+means to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death�a state
+
+which I feared yet did not understand. I admired virtue and good
+
+feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my
+
+cottagers, but I was shut out from intercourse with them, except
+
+through means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and
+
+unknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of
+
+becoming one among my fellows. The gentle words of Agatha and the
+
+animated smiles of the charming Arabian were not for me. The mild
+
+exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved
+
+Felix were not for me. Miserable, unhappy wretch!
+
+�Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply. I heard of the
+
+difference of sexes, and the birth and growth of children, how the
+
+father doted on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the
+
+older child, how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up
+
+in the precious charge, how the mind of youth expanded and gained
+
+knowledge, of brother, sister, and all the various relationships which
+
+bind one human being to another in mutual bonds.
+
+�But where were my friends and relations? No father had watched my
+
+infant days, no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if
+
+they had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I
+
+distinguished nothing. From my earliest remembrance I had been as I
+
+then was in height and proportion. I had never yet seen a being
+
+resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me. What was I? The
+
+question again recurred, to be answered only with groans.
+
+�I will soon explain to what these feelings tended, but allow me now to
+
+return to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various
+
+feelings of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated
+
+in additional love and reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, in
+
+an innocent, half-painful self-deceit, to call them).�

+Chapter 18
+
+Day after day, week after week, passed away on my return to Geneva; and
+
+I could not collect the courage to recommence my work. I feared the
+
+vengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my
+
+repugnance to the task which was enjoined me. I found that I could not
+
+compose a female without again devoting several months to profound
+
+study and laborious disquisition. I had heard of some discoveries
+
+having been made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which was
+
+material to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my
+
+father�s consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung to
+
+every pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an
+
+undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to
+
+me. A change indeed had taken place in me; my health, which had
+
+hitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when
+
+unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably. My
+
+father saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts
+
+towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy,
+
+which every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring
+
+blackness overcast the approaching sunshine. At these moments I took
+
+refuge in the most perfect solitude. I passed whole days on the lake
+
+alone in a little boat, watching the clouds and listening to the
+
+rippling of the waves, silent and listless. But the fresh air and
+
+bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure, and
+
+on my return I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile
+
+and a more cheerful heart.
+
+It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father,
+
+calling me aside, thus addressed me,
+
+�I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former
+
+pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself. And yet you are still
+
+unhappy and still avoid our society. For some time I was lost in
+
+conjecture as to the cause of this, but yesterday an idea struck me,
+
+and if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it. Reserve on such a
+
+point would be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on us all.�
+
+I trembled violently at his exordium, and my father continued�
+
+�I confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your
+
+marriage with our dear Elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the
+
+stay of my declining years. You were attached to each other from your
+
+earliest infancy; you studied together, and appeared, in dispositions and
+
+tastes, entirely suited to one another. But so blind is the experience of
+
+man that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have
+
+entirely destroyed it. You, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any
+
+wish that she might become your wife. Nay, you may have met with another
+
+whom you may love; and considering yourself as bound in honour to
+
+Elizabeth, this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear
+
+to feel.�
+
+�My dear father, reassure yourself. I love my cousin tenderly and
+
+sincerely. I never saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth does, my
+
+warmest admiration and affection. My future hopes and prospects are
+
+entirely bound up in the expectation of our union.�
+
+�The expression of your sentiments of this subject, my dear Victor,
+
+gives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced. If you
+
+feel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast
+
+a gloom over us. But it is this gloom which appears to have taken so
+
+strong a hold of your mind that I wish to dissipate. Tell me,
+
+therefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of the
+
+marriage. We have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us
+
+from that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities. You
+
+are younger; yet I do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent
+
+fortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future
+
+plans of honour and utility that you may have formed. Do not suppose,
+
+however, that I wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on
+
+your part would cause me any serious uneasiness. Interpret my words
+
+with candour and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and
+
+sincerity.�
+
+I listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable
+
+of offering any reply. I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of
+
+thoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion. Alas! To me
+
+the idea of an immediate union with my Elizabeth was one of horror and
+
+dismay. I was bound by a solemn promise which I had not yet fulfilled
+
+and dared not break, or if I did, what manifold miseries might not
+
+impend over me and my devoted family! Could I enter into a festival
+
+with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the
+
+ground? I must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with
+
+his mate before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from
+
+which I expected peace.
+
+I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to
+
+England or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers
+
+of that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable
+
+use to me in my present undertaking. The latter method of obtaining
+
+the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, I
+
+had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my
+
+loathsome task in my father�s house while in habits of familiar
+
+intercourse with those I loved. I knew that a thousand fearful
+
+accidents might occur, the slightest of which would disclose a tale to
+
+thrill all connected with me with horror. I was aware also that I
+
+should often lose all self-command, all capacity of hiding the
+
+harrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my
+
+unearthly occupation. I must absent myself from all I loved while thus
+
+employed. Once commenced, it would quickly be achieved, and I might be
+
+restored to my family in peace and happiness. My promise fulfilled,
+
+the monster would depart for ever. Or (so my fond fancy imaged) some
+
+accident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my
+
+slavery for ever.
+
+These feelings dictated my answer to my father. I expressed a wish to
+
+visit England, but concealing the true reasons of this request, I
+
+clothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while I
+
+urged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to
+
+comply. After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that
+
+resembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find
+
+that I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey,
+
+and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before my
+
+return, have restored me entirely to myself.
+
+The duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, or
+
+at most a year, was the period contemplated. One paternal kind
+
+precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion. Without
+
+previously communicating with me, he had, in concert with Elizabeth,
+
+arranged that Clerval should join me at Strasburgh. This interfered
+
+with the solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my task; yet at the
+
+commencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be
+
+an impediment, and truly I rejoiced that thus I should be saved many
+
+hours of lonely, maddening reflection. Nay, Henry might stand between
+
+me and the intrusion of my foe. If I were alone, would he not at times
+
+force his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to
+
+contemplate its progress?
+
+To England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union
+
+with Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return. My father�s
+
+age rendered him extremely averse to delay. For myself, there was one
+
+reward I promised myself from my detested toils�one consolation for my
+
+unparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when,
+
+enfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth and
+
+forget the past in my union with her.
+
+I now made arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted me
+
+which filled me with fear and agitation. During my absence I should
+
+leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and
+
+unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my
+
+departure. But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go, and
+
+would he not accompany me to England? This imagination was dreadful in
+
+itself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends.
+
+I was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of
+
+this might happen. But through the whole period during which I was the
+
+slave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of
+
+the moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend
+
+would follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his
+
+machinations.
+
+It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native
+
+country. My journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth
+
+therefore acquiesced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of
+
+my suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief. It had
+
+been her care which provided me a companion in Clerval�and yet a man
+
+is blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a woman�s
+
+sedulous attention. She longed to bid me hasten my return; a thousand
+
+conflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful, silent
+
+farewell.
+
+I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly
+
+knowing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around.
+
+I remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on
+
+it, to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with
+
+me. Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful
+
+and majestic scenes, but my eyes were fixed and unobserving. I could
+
+only think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy
+
+me whilst they endured.
+
+After some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed
+
+many leagues, I arrived at Strasburgh, where I waited two days for
+
+Clerval. He came. Alas, how great was the contrast between us! He
+
+was alive to every new scene, joyful when he saw the beauties of the
+
+setting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new
+
+day. He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and
+
+the appearances of the sky. �This is what it is to live,� he cried;
+
+�now I enjoy existence! But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are
+
+you desponding and sorrowful!� In truth, I was occupied by gloomy
+
+thoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden
+
+sunrise reflected in the Rhine. And you, my friend, would be far more
+
+amused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an
+
+eye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections. I, a
+
+miserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to
+
+enjoyment.
+
+We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasburgh to
+
+Rotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London. During this
+
+voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns.
+
+We stayed a day at Mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure from
+
+Strasburgh, arrived at Mainz. The course of the Rhine below Mainz
+
+becomes much more picturesque. The river descends rapidly and winds
+
+between hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms. We saw
+
+many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by
+
+black woods, high and inaccessible. This part of the Rhine, indeed,
+
+presents a singularly variegated landscape. In one spot you view
+
+rugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with
+
+the dark Rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory,
+
+flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river
+
+and populous towns occupy the scene.
+
+We travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers
+
+as we glided down the stream. Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits
+
+continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I lay at the
+
+bottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to
+
+drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger. And if these
+
+were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry? He felt as if he had
+
+been transported to Fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by
+
+man. �I have seen,� he said, �the most beautiful scenes
+
+of my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the
+
+snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black
+
+and impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance
+
+were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay
+
+appearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore
+
+up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be
+
+on the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain,
+
+where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and
+
+where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the
+
+nightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud;
+
+but this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders. The
+
+mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a
+
+charm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled.
+
+Look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the
+
+island, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now
+
+that group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village
+
+half hid in the recess of the mountain. Oh, surely the spirit that inhabits
+
+and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who
+
+pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of
+
+our own country.�
+
+Clerval! Beloved friend! Even now it delights me to record your words and
+
+to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving. He was a
+
+being formed in the �very poetry of nature.� His wild and
+
+enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart. His
+
+soul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that
+
+devoted and wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach us to look for only
+
+in the imagination. But even human sympathies were not sufficient to
+
+satisfy his eager mind. The scenery of external nature, which others regard
+
+only with admiration, he loved with ardour:�
+
+��The sounding cataract
+
+Haunted him like a passion: the tall rock,
+
+The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,
+
+Their colours and their forms, were then to him
+
+An appetite; a feeling, and a love,
+
+That had no need of a remoter charm,
+
+By thought supplied, or any interest
+
+Unborrow�d from the eye.
+
+[Wordsworth�s �Tintern Abbey�.]
+
+And where does he now exist? Is this gentle and lovely being lost
+
+for ever? Has this mind, so replete with ideas, imaginations fanciful
+
+and magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the
+
+life of its creator;�has this mind perished? Does it now only exist
+
+in my memory? No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and
+
+beaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and
+
+consoles your unhappy friend.
+
+Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight
+
+tribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart,
+
+overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates. I will
+
+proceed with my tale.
+
+Beyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; and we resolved to
+
+post the remainder of our way, for the wind was contrary and the stream of
+
+the river was too gentle to aid us.
+
+Our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery, but we
+
+arrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England.
+
+It was on a clear morning, in the latter days of December, that I first saw
+
+the white cliffs of Britain. The banks of the Thames presented a new scene;
+
+they were flat but fertile, and almost every town was marked by the
+
+remembrance of some story. We saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the Spanish
+
+Armada, Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich�places which I had heard
+
+of even in my country.
+
+At length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St. Paul�s towering
+
+above all, and the Tower famed in English history.

+Chapter 5
+
+It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment
+
+of my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I
+
+collected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a
+
+spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was
+
+already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the
+
+panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the
+
+half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature
+
+open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.
+
+How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate
+
+the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to
+
+form? His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as
+
+beautiful. Beautiful! Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered
+
+the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous
+
+black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these
+
+luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes,
+
+that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which
+
+they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.
+
+The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings
+
+of human nature. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole
+
+purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had
+
+deprived myself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour
+
+that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty
+
+of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my
+
+heart. Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I
+
+rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my
+
+bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep. At length lassitude
+
+succeeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the
+
+bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.
+
+But it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest
+
+dreams. I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in
+
+the streets of Ingolstadt. Delighted and surprised, I embraced her,
+
+but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with
+
+the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I
+
+held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her
+
+form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel.
+
+I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my
+
+teeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and
+
+yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window
+
+shutters, I beheld the wretch�the miserable monster whom I had
+
+created. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they
+
+may be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and he muttered some
+
+inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have
+
+spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to
+
+detain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs. I took refuge in the
+
+courtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained
+
+during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest
+
+agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if
+
+it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I
+
+had so miserably given life.
+
+Oh! No mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A mummy
+
+again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. I
+
+had gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those
+
+muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing
+
+such as even Dante could not have conceived.
+
+I passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and
+
+hardly that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly
+
+sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness. Mingled with
+
+this horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had
+
+been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a
+
+hell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!
+
+Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my
+
+sleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple
+
+and clock, which indicated the sixth hour. The porter opened the gates
+
+of the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I issued into
+
+the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the
+
+wretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my
+
+view. I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but
+
+felt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured
+
+from a black and comfortless sky.
+
+I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by
+
+bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I
+
+traversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was or
+
+what I was doing. My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear, and I
+
+hurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me:
+
+Like one who, on a lonely road,
+
+Doth walk in fear and dread,
+
+And, having once turned round, walks on,
+
+And turns no more his head;
+
+Because he knows a frightful fiend
+
+Doth close behind him tread.
+
+[Coleridge�s �Ancient Mariner.�]
+
+Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various
+
+diligences and carriages usually stopped. Here I paused, I knew not why;
+
+but I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming
+
+towards me from the other end of the street. As it drew nearer I observed
+
+that it was the Swiss diligence; it stopped just where I was standing, and
+
+on the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me,
+
+instantly sprung out. �My dear Frankenstein,� exclaimed he,
+
+�how glad I am to see you! How fortunate that you should be here at
+
+the very moment of my alighting!�
+
+Nothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought back
+
+to my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so dear
+
+to my recollection. I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror
+
+and misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months,
+
+calm and serene joy. I welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial
+
+manner, and we walked towards my college. Clerval continued talking for
+
+some time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being
+
+permitted to come to Ingolstadt. �You may easily believe,� said
+
+he, �how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all
+
+necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping;
+
+and, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his constant
+
+answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch
+
+schoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield: �I have ten thousand florins
+
+a year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.� But his
+
+affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and he has
+
+permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of
+
+knowledge.�
+
+�It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left
+
+my father, brothers, and Elizabeth.�
+
+�Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from
+
+you so seldom. By the by, I mean to lecture you a little upon their
+
+account myself. But, my dear Frankenstein,� continued he, stopping
+
+short and gazing full in my face, �I did not before remark how very ill
+
+you appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching for
+
+several nights.�
+
+�You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one
+
+occupation that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see;
+
+but I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an
+
+end and that I am at length free.�
+
+I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to
+
+allude to, the occurrences of the preceding night. I walked with a
+
+quick pace, and we soon arrived at my college. I then reflected, and
+
+the thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my
+
+apartment might still be there, alive and walking about. I dreaded to
+
+behold this monster, but I feared still more that Henry should see him.
+
+Entreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the
+
+stairs, I darted up towards my own room. My hand was already on the
+
+lock of the door before I recollected myself. I then paused, and a
+
+cold shivering came over me. I threw the door forcibly open, as
+
+children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in
+
+waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared. I stepped
+
+fearfully in: the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freed
+
+from its hideous guest. I could hardly believe that so great a good
+
+fortune could have befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemy
+
+had indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval.
+
+We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast;
+
+but I was unable to contain myself. It was not joy only that possessed
+
+me; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse
+
+beat rapidly. I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same
+
+place; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud.
+
+Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival,
+
+but when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes
+
+for which he could not account, and my loud, unrestrained, heartless
+
+laughter frightened and astonished him.
+
+�My dear Victor,� cried he, �what, for God�s sake,
+
+is the matter? Do not laugh in that manner. How ill you are! What is the
+
+cause of all this?�
+
+�Do not ask me,� cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I
+
+thought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; �_he_ can
+
+tell. Oh, save me! Save me!� I imagined that the monster seized me;
+
+I struggled furiously and fell down in a fit.
+
+Poor Clerval! What must have been his feelings? A meeting, which he
+
+anticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness. But I
+
+was not the witness of his grief, for I was lifeless and did not
+
+recover my senses for a long, long time.
+
+This was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for
+
+several months. During all that time Henry was my only nurse. I
+
+afterwards learned that, knowing my father�s advanced age and unfitness
+
+for so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make
+
+Elizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my
+
+disorder. He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive
+
+nurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he
+
+did not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest
+
+action that he could towards them.
+
+But I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and
+
+unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life.
+
+The form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever
+
+before my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him. Doubtless my
+
+words surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings
+
+of my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which I
+
+continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder
+
+indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.
+
+By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and
+
+grieved my friend, I recovered. I remember the first time I became
+
+capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I
+
+perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young
+
+buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window. It was
+
+a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my
+
+convalescence. I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in
+
+my bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as
+
+cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion.
+
+�Dearest Clerval,� exclaimed I, �how kind, how very good
+
+you are to me. This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you
+
+promised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room. How shall I ever
+
+repay you? I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which I
+
+have been the occasion, but you will forgive me.�
+
+�You will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself, but get
+
+well as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, I
+
+may speak to you on one subject, may I not?�
+
+I trembled. One subject! What could it be? Could he allude to an object on
+
+whom I dared not even think?
+
+�Compose yourself,� said Clerval, who observed my change of
+
+colour, �I will not mention it if it agitates you; but your father
+
+and cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your
+
+own handwriting. They hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at
+
+your long silence.�
+
+�Is that all, my dear Henry? How could you suppose that my first
+
+thought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love and
+
+who are so deserving of my love?�
+
+�If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad
+
+to see a letter that has been lying here some days for you; it is from
+
+your cousin, I believe.�

+Letter 4
+
+_To Mrs. Saville, England._
+
+August 5th, 17�.
+
+So strange an accident has happened to us that I cannot forbear
+
+recording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before
+
+these papers can come into your possession.
+
+Last Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed
+
+in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which
+
+she floated. Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we
+
+were compassed round by a very thick fog. We accordingly lay to,
+
+hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.
+
+About two o�clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out
+
+in every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to
+
+have no end. Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to
+
+grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly
+
+attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own
+
+situation. We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by
+
+dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; a
+
+being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature,
+
+sat in the sledge and guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progress
+
+of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the
+
+distant inequalities of the ice.
+
+This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as we believed,
+
+many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that
+
+it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by
+
+ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the
+
+greatest attention.
+
+About two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before
+
+night the ice broke and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the
+
+morning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which
+
+float about after the breaking up of the ice. I profited of this time to
+
+rest for a few hours.
+
+In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and
+
+found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently
+
+talking to someone in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we
+
+had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large
+
+fragment of ice. Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human
+
+being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.
+
+He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of
+
+some undiscovered island, but a European. When I appeared on deck the
+
+master said, �Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish
+
+on the open sea.�
+
+On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a
+
+foreign accent. �Before I come on board your vessel,� said he,
+
+�will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?�
+
+You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed
+
+to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have
+
+supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not
+
+have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford. I
+
+replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the
+
+northern pole.
+
+Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board.
+
+Good God! Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for
+
+his safety, your surprise would have been boundless. His limbs were
+
+nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and
+
+suffering. I never saw a man in so wretched a condition. We attempted
+
+to carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh
+
+air he fainted. We accordingly brought him back to the deck and
+
+restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to
+
+swallow a small quantity. As soon as he showed signs of life we
+
+wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the
+
+kitchen stove. By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup,
+
+which restored him wonderfully.
+
+Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I often
+
+feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding. When he
+
+had in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and
+
+attended on him as much as my duty would permit. I never saw a more
+
+interesting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of
+
+wildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone
+
+performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most
+
+trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with
+
+a beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he
+
+is generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his
+
+teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.
+
+When my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off
+
+the men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not
+
+allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body
+
+and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.
+
+Once, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice
+
+in so strange a vehicle.
+
+His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and
+
+he replied, �To seek one who fled from me.�
+
+�And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?�
+
+�Yes.�
+
+�Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we
+
+saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.�
+
+This aroused the stranger�s attention, and he asked a multitude of
+
+questions concerning the route which the d�mon, as he called him, had
+
+pursued. Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, �I have,
+
+doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good
+
+people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.�
+
+�Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to
+
+trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.�
+
+�And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have
+
+benevolently restored me to life.�
+
+Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the
+
+ice had destroyed the other sledge. I replied that I could not answer
+
+with any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near
+
+midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety
+
+before that time; but of this I could not judge.
+
+From this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the
+
+stranger. He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for
+
+the sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in
+
+the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere.
+
+I have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant
+
+notice if any new object should appear in sight.
+
+Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the
+
+present day. The stranger has gradually improved in health but is very
+
+silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin.
+
+Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all
+
+interested in him, although they have had very little communication
+
+with him. For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his
+
+constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion. He must
+
+have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck
+
+so attractive and amiable.
+
+I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend
+
+on the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had been
+
+broken by misery, I should have been happy to have possessed as the brother
+
+of my heart.
+
+I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals,
+
+should I have any fresh incidents to record.
+
+August 13th, 17�.
+
+My affection for my guest increases every day. He excites at once my
+
+admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see so
+
+noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant
+
+grief? He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and
+
+when he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art,
+
+yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.
+
+He is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck,
+
+apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although
+
+unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he
+
+interests himself deeply in the projects of others. He has frequently
+
+conversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without
+
+disguise. He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my
+
+eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken
+
+to secure it. I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the
+
+language of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul
+
+and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would
+
+sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my
+
+enterprise. One man�s life or death were but a small price to pay for
+
+the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I should
+
+acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race. As I spoke, a
+
+dark gloom spread over my listener�s countenance. At first I
+
+perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before
+
+his eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle
+
+fast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast. I
+
+paused; at length he spoke, in broken accents: �Unhappy man! Do you
+
+share my madness? Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught? Hear me;
+
+let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!�
+
+Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the
+
+paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened
+
+powers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were
+
+necessary to restore his composure.
+
+Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise
+
+himself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of
+
+despair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally. He asked
+
+me the history of my earlier years. The tale was quickly told, but it
+
+awakened various trains of reflection. I spoke of my desire of finding a
+
+friend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than
+
+had ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could
+
+boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.
+
+�I agree with you,� replied the stranger; �we are
+
+unfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than
+
+ourselves�such a friend ought to be�do not lend his aid to
+
+perfectionate our weak and faulty natures. I once had a friend, the most
+
+noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting
+
+friendship. You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for
+
+despair. But I�I have lost everything and cannot begin life
+
+anew.�
+
+As he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settled
+
+grief that touched me to the heart. But he was silent and presently
+
+retired to his cabin.
+
+Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he
+
+does the beauties of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every sight
+
+afforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of
+
+elevating his soul from earth. Such a man has a double existence: he
+
+may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he
+
+has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a
+
+halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.
+
+Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine
+
+wanderer? You would not if you saw him. You have been tutored and
+
+refined by books and retirement from the world, and you are therefore
+
+somewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to
+
+appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man. Sometimes I
+
+have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that
+
+elevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew. I
+
+believe it to be an intuitive discernment, a quick but never-failing
+
+power of judgment, a penetration into the causes of things, unequalled
+
+for clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression and a
+
+voice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.
+
+August 19th, 17�.
+
+Yesterday the stranger said to me, �You may easily perceive, Captain
+
+Walton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. I had
+
+determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with
+
+me, but you have won me to alter my determination. You seek for
+
+knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the
+
+gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine
+
+has been. I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be
+
+useful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same
+
+course, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me
+
+what I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale, one
+
+that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you
+
+in case of failure. Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually
+
+deemed marvellous. Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I might
+
+fear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things
+
+will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would
+
+provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers
+
+of nature; nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series
+
+internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed.�
+
+You may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered
+
+communication, yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by
+
+a recital of his misfortunes. I felt the greatest eagerness to hear
+
+the promised narrative, partly from curiosity and partly from a strong
+
+desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power. I expressed
+
+these feelings in my answer.
+
+�I thank you,� he replied, �for your sympathy, but it is
+
+useless; my fate is nearly fulfilled. I wait but for one event, and then I
+
+shall repose in peace. I understand your feeling,� continued he,
+
+perceiving that I wished to interrupt him; �but you are mistaken, my
+
+friend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my
+
+destiny; listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is
+
+determined.�
+
+He then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when I
+
+should be at leisure. This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. I have
+
+resolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to
+
+record, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during
+
+the day. If I should be engaged, I will at least make notes. This
+
+manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure; but to me, who
+
+know him, and who hear it from his own lips�with what interest and
+
+sympathy shall I read it in some future day! Even now, as I commence my
+
+task, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me
+
+with all their melancholy sweetness; I see his thin hand raised in
+
+animation, while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul
+
+within. Strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the storm which
+
+embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it�thus!

+The Strange Case Of Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hydeby Robert Louis StevensonContentsSTORY OF THE DOORSEARCH FOR MR. HYDEDR. JEKYLL WAS QUITE AT EASETHE CAREW MURDER CASEINCIDENT OF THE LETTERINCIDENT OF DR. LANYONINCIDENT AT THE WINDOWTHE LAST NIGHTDR. LANYON’S NARRATIVEHENRY JEKYLL’S FULL STATEMENT OF THE CASESTORY OF THE DOORMr. Utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that wasnever lighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse;backward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehowlovable. At friendly meetings, and when the wine was to his taste,something eminently human beaconed from his eye; something indeed whichnever found its way into his talk, but which spoke not only in thesesilent symbols of the after-dinner face, but more often and loudly inthe acts of his life. He was austere with himself; drank gin when hewas alone, to mortify a taste for vintages; and though he enjoyed thetheatre, had not crossed the doors of one for twenty years. But he hadan approved tolerance for others; sometimes wondering, almost withenvy, at the high pressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds; andin any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove. “I incline toCain’s heresy,” he used to say quaintly: “I let my brother go to thedevil in his own way.” In this character, it was frequently his fortuneto be the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influence inthe lives of downgoing men. And to such as these, so long as they cameabout his chambers, he never marked a shade of change in his demeanour.No doubt the feat was easy to Mr. Utterson; for he was undemonstrativeat the best, and even his friendship seemed to be founded in a similarcatholicity of good-nature. It is the mark of a modest man to accepthis friendly circle ready-made from the hands of opportunity; and thatwas the lawyer’s way. His friends were those of his own blood or thosewhom he had known the longest; his affections, like ivy, were thegrowth of time, they implied no aptness in the object. Hence, no doubtthe bond that united him to Mr. Richard Enfield, his distant kinsman,the well-known man about town. It was a nut to crack for many, whatthese two could see in each other, or what subject they could find incommon. It was reported by those who encountered them in their Sundaywalks, that they said nothing, looked singularly dull and would hailwith obvious relief the appearance of a friend. For all that, the twomen put the greatest store by these excursions, counted them the chiefjewel of each week, and not only set aside occasions of pleasure, buteven resisted the calls of business, that they might enjoy themuninterrupted.It chanced on one of these rambles that their way led them down aby-street in a busy quarter of London. The street was small and what iscalled quiet, but it drove a thriving trade on the weekdays. Theinhabitants were all doing well, it seemed and all emulously hoping todo better still, and laying out the surplus of their grains incoquetry; so that the shop fronts stood along that thoroughfare with anair of invitation, like rows of smiling saleswomen. Even on Sunday,when it veiled its more florid charms and lay comparatively empty ofpassage, the street shone out in contrast to its dingy neighbourhood,like a fire in a forest; and with its freshly painted shutters,well-polished brasses, and general cleanliness and gaiety of note,instantly caught and pleased the eye of the passenger.Two doors from one corner, on the left hand going east the line wasbroken by the entry of a court; and just at that point a certainsinister block of building thrust forward its gable on the street. Itwas two storeys high; showed no window, nothing but a door on the lowerstorey and a blind forehead of discoloured wall on the upper; and borein every feature, the marks of prolonged and sordid negligence. Thedoor, which was equipped with neither bell nor knocker, was blisteredand distained. Tramps slouched into the recess and struck matches onthe panels; children kept shop upon the steps; the schoolboy had triedhis knife on the mouldings; and for close on a generation, no one hadappeared to drive away these random visitors or to repair theirravages.Mr. Enfield and the lawyer were on the other side of the by-street; butwhen they came abreast of the entry, the former lifted up his cane andpointed.“Did you ever remark that door?” he asked; and when his companion hadreplied in the affirmative, “It is connected in my mind,” added he,“with a very odd story.”“Indeed?” said Mr. Utterson, with a slight change of voice, “and whatwas that?”“Well, it was this way,” returned Mr. Enfield: “I was coming home fromsome place at the end of the world, about three o’clock of a blackwinter morning, and my way lay through a part of town where there wasliterally nothing to be seen but lamps. Street after street and all thefolks asleep—street after street, all lighted up as if for a processionand all as empty as a church—till at last I got into that state of mindwhen a man listens and listens and begins to long for the sight of apoliceman. All at once, I saw two figures: one a little man who wasstumping along eastward at a good walk, and the other a girl of maybeeight or ten who was running as hard as she was able down a crossstreet. Well, sir, the two ran into one another naturally enough at thecorner; and then came the horrible part of the thing; for the mantrampled calmly over the child’s body and left her screaming on theground. It sounds nothing to hear, but it was hellish to see. It wasn’tlike a man; it was like some damned Juggernaut. I gave a few halloa,took to my heels, collared my gentleman, and brought him back to wherethere was already quite a group about the screaming child. He wasperfectly cool and made no resistance, but gave me one look, so uglythat it brought out the sweat on me like running. The people who hadturned out were the girl’s own family; and pretty soon, the doctor, forwhom she had been sent put in his appearance. Well, the child was notmuch the worse, more frightened, according to the sawbones; and thereyou might have supposed would be an end to it. But there was onecurious circumstance. I had taken a loathing to my gentleman at firstsight. So had the child’s family, which was only natural. But thedoctor’s case was what struck me. He was the usual cut and dryapothecary, of no particular age and colour, with a strong Edinburghaccent and about as emotional as a bagpipe. Well, sir, he was like therest of us; every time he looked at my prisoner, I saw that sawbonesturn sick and white with the desire to kill him. I knew what was in hismind, just as he knew what was in mine; and killing being out of thequestion, we did the next best. We told the man we could and would makesuch a scandal out of this as should make his name stink from one endof London to the other. If he had any friends or any credit, weundertook that he should lose them. And all the time, as we werepitching it in red hot, we were keeping the women off him as best wecould for they were as wild as harpies. I never saw a circle of suchhateful faces; and there was the man in the middle, with a kind ofblack sneering coolness—frightened too, I could see that—but carryingit off, sir, really like Satan. ‘If you choose to make capital out ofthis accident,’ said he, ‘I am naturally helpless. No gentleman butwishes to avoid a scene,’ says he. ‘Name your figure.’ Well, we screwedhim up to a hundred pounds for the child’s family; he would haveclearly liked to stick out; but there was something about the lot of usthat meant mischief, and at last he struck. The next thing was to getthe money; and where do you think he carried us but to that place withthe door?—whipped out a key, went in, and presently came back with thematter of ten pounds in gold and a cheque for the balance on Coutts’s,drawn payable to bearer and signed with a name that I can’t mention,though it’s one of the points of my story, but it was a name at leastvery well known and often printed. The figure was stiff; but thesignature was good for more than that if it was only genuine. I tookthe liberty of pointing out to my gentleman that the whole businesslooked apocryphal, and that a man does not, in real life, walk into acellar door at four in the morning and come out with another man’scheque for close upon a hundred pounds. But he was quite easy andsneering. ‘Set your mind at rest,’ says he, ‘I will stay with you tillthe banks open and cash the cheque myself.’ So we all set off, thedoctor, and the child’s father, and our friend and myself, and passedthe rest of the night in my chambers; and next day, when we hadbreakfasted, went in a body to the bank. I gave in the cheque myself,and said I had every reason to believe it was a forgery. Not a bit ofit. The cheque was genuine.”“Tut-tut!” said Mr. Utterson.“I see you feel as I do,” said Mr. Enfield. “Yes, it’s a bad story. Formy man was a fellow that nobody could have to do with, a reallydamnable man; and the person that drew the cheque is the very pink ofthe proprieties, celebrated too, and (what makes it worse) one of yourfellows who do what they call good. Blackmail, I suppose; an honest manpaying through the nose for some of the capers of his youth. Black MailHouse is what I call the place with the door, in consequence. Thougheven that, you know, is far from explaining all,” he added, and withthe words fell into a vein of musing.From this he was recalled by Mr. Utterson asking rather suddenly: “Andyou don’t know if the drawer of the cheque lives there?”“A likely place, isn’t it?” returned Mr. Enfield. “But I happen to havenoticed his address; he lives in some square or other.”“And you never asked about the—place with the door?” said Mr. Utterson.“No, sir; I had a delicacy,” was the reply. “I feel very strongly aboutputting questions; it partakes too much of the style of the day ofjudgment. You start a question, and it’s like starting a stone. You sitquietly on the top of a hill; and away the stone goes, starting others;and presently some bland old bird (the last you would have thought of)is knocked on the head in his own back garden and the family have tochange their name. No sir, I make it a rule of mine: the more it lookslike Queer Street, the less I ask.”“A very good rule, too,” said the lawyer.“But I have studied the place for myself,” continued Mr. Enfield. “Itseems scarcely a house. There is no other door, and nobody goes in orout of that one but, once in a great while, the gentleman of myadventure. There are three windows looking on the court on the firstfloor; none below; the windows are always shut but they’re clean. Andthen there is a chimney which is generally smoking; so somebody mustlive there. And yet it’s not so sure; for the buildings are so packedtogether about the court, that it’s hard to say where one ends andanother begins.”The pair walked on again for a while in silence; and then “Enfield,”said Mr. Utterson, “that’s a good rule of yours.”“Yes, I think it is,” returned Enfield.“But for all that,” continued the lawyer, “there’s one point I want toask. I want to ask the name of that man who walked over the child.”“Well,” said Mr. Enfield, “I can’t see what harm it would do. It was aman of the name of Hyde.”“Hm,” said Mr. Utterson. “What sort of a man is he to see?”“He is not easy to describe. There is something wrong with hisappearance; something displeasing, something down-right detestable. Inever saw a man I so disliked, and yet I scarce know why. He must bedeformed somewhere; he gives a strong feeling of deformity, although Icouldn’t specify the point. He’s an extraordinary looking man, and yetI really can name nothing out of the way. No, sir; I can make no handof it; I can’t describe him. And it’s not want of memory; for I declareI can see him this moment.”Mr. Utterson again walked some way in silence and obviously under aweight of consideration. “You are sure he used a key?” he inquired atlast.“My dear sir...” began Enfield, surprised out of himself.“Yes, I know,” said Utterson; “I know it must seem strange. The factis, if I do not ask you the name of the other party, it is because Iknow it already. You see, Richard, your tale has gone home. If you havebeen inexact in any point you had better correct it.”“I think you might have warned me,” returned the other with a touch ofsullenness. “But I have been pedantically exact, as you call it. Thefellow had a key; and what’s more, he has it still. I saw him use itnot a week ago.”Mr. Utterson sighed deeply but said never a word; and the young manpresently resumed. “Here is another lesson to say nothing,” said he. “Iam ashamed of my long tongue. Let us make a bargain never to refer tothis again.”“With all my heart,” said the lawyer. “I shake hands on that, Richard.”SEARCH FOR MR. HYDEThat evening Mr. Utterson came home to his bachelor house in sombrespirits and sat down to dinner without relish. It was his custom of aSunday, when this meal was over, to sit close by the fire, a volume ofsome dry divinity on his reading desk, until the clock of theneighbouring church rang out the hour of twelve, when he would gosoberly and gratefully to bed. On this night however, as soon as thecloth was taken away, he took up a candle and went into his businessroom. There he opened his safe, took from the most private part of it adocument endorsed on the envelope as Dr. Jekyll’s Will and sat downwith a clouded brow to study its contents. The will was holograph, forMr. Utterson though he took charge of it now that it was made, hadrefused to lend the least assistance in the making of it; it providednot only that, in case of the decease of Henry Jekyll, M.D., D.C.L.,L.L.D., F.R.S., etc., all his possessions were to pass into the handsof his “friend and benefactor Edward Hyde,” but that in case of Dr.Jekyll’s “disappearance or unexplained absence for any period exceedingthree calendar months,” the said Edward Hyde should step into the saidHenry Jekyll’s shoes without further delay and free from any burthen orobligation beyond the payment of a few small sums to the members of thedoctor’s household. This document had long been the lawyer’s eyesore.It offended him both as a lawyer and as a lover of the sane andcustomary sides of life, to whom the fanciful was the immodest. Andhitherto it was his ignorance of Mr. Hyde that had swelled hisindignation; now, by a sudden turn, it was his knowledge. It wasalready bad enough when the name was but a name of which he could learnno more. It was worse when it began to be clothed upon with detestableattributes; and out of the shifting, insubstantial mists that had solong baffled his eye, there leaped up the sudden, definite presentmentof a fiend.“I thought it was madness,” he said, as he replaced the obnoxious paperin the safe, “and now I begin to fear it is disgrace.”With that he blew out his candle, put on a greatcoat, and set forth inthe direction of Cavendish Square, that citadel of medicine, where hisfriend, the great Dr. Lanyon, had his house and received his crowdingpatients. “If anyone knows, it will be Lanyon,” he had thought.The solemn butler knew and welcomed him; he was subjected to no stageof delay, but ushered direct from the door to the dining-room where Dr.Lanyon sat alone over his wine. This was a hearty, healthy, dapper,red-faced gentleman, with a shock of hair prematurely white, and aboisterous and decided manner. At sight of Mr. Utterson, he sprang upfrom his chair and welcomed him with both hands. The geniality, as wasthe way of the man, was somewhat theatrical to the eye; but it reposedon genuine feeling. For these two were old friends, old mates both atschool and college, both thorough respectors of themselves and of eachother, and what does not always follow, men who thoroughly enjoyed eachother’s company.After a little rambling talk, the lawyer led up to the subject which sodisagreeably preoccupied his mind.“I suppose, Lanyon,” said he, “you and I must be the two oldest friendsthat Henry Jekyll has?”“I wish the friends were younger,” chuckled Dr. Lanyon. “But I supposewe are. And what of that? I see little of him now.”“Indeed?” said Utterson. “I thought you had a bond of common interest.”“We had,” was the reply. “But it is more than ten years since HenryJekyll became too fanciful for me. He began to go wrong, wrong in mind;and though of course I continue to take an interest in him for oldsake’s sake, as they say, I see and I have seen devilish little of theman. Such unscientific balderdash,” added the doctor, flushing suddenlypurple, “would have estranged Damon and Pythias.”This little spirit of temper was somewhat of a relief to Mr. Utterson.“They have only differed on some point of science,” he thought; andbeing a man of no scientific passions (except in the matter ofconveyancing), he even added: “It is nothing worse than that!” He gavehis friend a few seconds to recover his composure, and then approachedthe question he had come to put. “Did you ever come across a _protégé_of his—one Hyde?” he asked.“Hyde?” repeated Lanyon. “No. Never heard of him. Since my time.”That was the amount of information that the lawyer carried back withhim to the great, dark bed on which he tossed to and fro, until thesmall hours of the morning began to grow large. It was a night oflittle ease to his toiling mind, toiling in mere darkness and besiegedby questions.Six o’clock struck on the bells of the church that was so convenientlynear to Mr. Utterson’s dwelling, and still he was digging at theproblem. Hitherto it had touched him on the intellectual side alone;but now his imagination also was engaged, or rather enslaved; and as helay and tossed in the gross darkness of the night and the curtainedroom, Mr. Enfield’s tale went by before his mind in a scroll of lightedpictures. He would be aware of the great field of lamps of a nocturnalcity; then of the figure of a man walking swiftly; then of a childrunning from the doctor’s; and then these met, and that humanJuggernaut trod the child down and passed on regardless of her screams.Or else he would see a room in a rich house, where his friend layasleep, dreaming and smiling at his dreams; and then the door of thatroom would be opened, the curtains of the bed plucked apart, thesleeper recalled, and lo! there would stand by his side a figure towhom power was given, and even at that dead hour, he must rise and doits bidding. The figure in these two phases haunted the lawyer allnight; and if at any time he dozed over, it was but to see it glidemore stealthily through sleeping houses, or move the more swiftly andstill the more swiftly, even to dizziness, through wider labyrinths oflamplighted city, and at every street corner crush a child and leaveher screaming. And still the figure had no face by which he might knowit; even in his dreams, it had no face, or one that baffled him andmelted before his eyes; and thus it was that there sprang up and grewapace in the lawyer’s mind a singularly strong, almost an inordinate,curiosity to behold the features of the real Mr. Hyde. If he could butonce set eyes on him, he thought the mystery would lighten and perhapsroll altogether away, as was the habit of mysterious things when wellexamined. He might see a reason for his friend’s strange preference orbondage (call it which you please) and even for the startling clause ofthe will. At least it would be a face worth seeing: the face of a manwho was without bowels of mercy: a face which had but to show itself toraise up, in the mind of the unimpressionable Enfield, a spirit ofenduring hatred.From that time forward, Mr. Utterson began to haunt the door in theby-street of shops. In the morning before office hours, at noon whenbusiness was plenty and time scarce, at night under the face of thefogged city moon, by all lights and at all hours of solitude orconcourse, the lawyer was to be found on his chosen post.“If he be Mr. Hyde,” he had thought, “I shall be Mr. Seek.”And at last his patience was rewarded. It was a fine dry night; frostin the air; the streets as clean as a ballroom floor; the lamps,unshaken by any wind, drawing a regular pattern of light and shadow. Byten o’clock, when the shops were closed, the by-street was verysolitary and, in spite of the low growl of London from all round, verysilent. Small sounds carried far; domestic sounds out of the houseswere clearly audible on either side of the roadway; and the rumour ofthe approach of any passenger preceded him by a long time. Mr. Uttersonhad been some minutes at his post, when he was aware of an odd lightfootstep drawing near. In the course of his nightly patrols, he hadlong grown accustomed to the quaint effect with which the footfalls ofa single person, while he is still a great way off, suddenly spring outdistinct from the vast hum and clatter of the city. Yet his attentionhad never before been so sharply and decisively arrested; and it waswith a strong, superstitious prevision of success that he withdrew intothe entry of the court.The steps drew swiftly nearer, and swelled out suddenly louder as theyturned the end of the street. The lawyer, looking forth from the entry,could soon see what manner of man he had to deal with. He was small andvery plainly dressed and the look of him, even at that distance, wentsomehow strongly against the watcher’s inclination. But he madestraight for the door, crossing the roadway to save time; and as hecame, he drew a key from his pocket like one approaching home.Mr. Utterson stepped out and touched him on the shoulder as he passed.“Mr. Hyde, I think?”Mr. Hyde shrank back with a hissing intake of the breath. But his fearwas only momentary; and though he did not look the lawyer in the face,he answered coolly enough: “That is my name. What do you want?”“I see you are going in,” returned the lawyer. “I am an old friend ofDr. Jekyll’s—Mr. Utterson of Gaunt Street—you must have heard of myname; and meeting you so conveniently, I thought you might admit me.”“You will not find Dr. Jekyll; he is from home,” replied Mr. Hyde,blowing in the key. And then suddenly, but still without looking up,“How did you know me?” he asked.“On your side,” said Mr. Utterson “will you do me a favour?”“With pleasure,” replied the other. “What shall it be?”“Will you let me see your face?” asked the lawyer.Mr. Hyde appeared to hesitate, and then, as if upon some suddenreflection, fronted about with an air of defiance; and the pair staredat each other pretty fixedly for a few seconds. “Now I shall know youagain,” said Mr. Utterson. “It may be useful.”“Yes,” returned Mr. Hyde, “It is as well we have met; and _à propos_,you should have my address.” And he gave a number of a street in Soho.“Good God!” thought Mr. Utterson, “can he, too, have been thinking ofthe will?” But he kept his feelings to himself and only grunted inacknowledgment of the address.“And now,” said the other, “how did you know me?”“By description,” was the reply.“Whose description?”“We have common friends,” said Mr. Utterson.“Common friends,” echoed Mr. Hyde, a little hoarsely. “Who are they?”“Jekyll, for instance,” said the lawyer.“He never told you,” cried Mr. Hyde, with a flush of anger. “I did notthink you would have lied.”“Come,” said Mr. Utterson, “that is not fitting language.”The other snarled aloud into a savage laugh; and the next moment, withextraordinary quickness, he had unlocked the door and disappeared intothe house.The lawyer stood awhile when Mr. Hyde had left him, the picture ofdisquietude. Then he began slowly to mount the street, pausing everystep or two and putting his hand to his brow like a man in mentalperplexity. The problem he was thus debating as he walked, was one of aclass that is rarely solved. Mr. Hyde was pale and dwarfish, he gave animpression of deformity without any nameable malformation, he had adispleasing smile, he had borne himself to the lawyer with a sort ofmurderous mixture of timidity and boldness, and he spoke with a husky,whispering and somewhat broken voice; all these were points againsthim, but not all of these together could explain the hitherto unknowndisgust, loathing and fear with which Mr. Utterson regarded him. “Theremust be something else,” said the perplexed gentleman. “There _is_something more, if I could find a name for it. God bless me, the manseems hardly human! Something troglodytic, shall we say? or can it bethe old story of Dr. Fell? or is it the mere radiance of a foul soulthat thus transpires through, and transfigures, its clay continent? Thelast, I think; for, O my poor old Harry Jekyll, if ever I read Satan’ssignature upon a face, it is on that of your new friend.”Round the corner from the by-street, there was a square of ancient,handsome houses, now for the most part decayed from their high estateand let in flats and chambers to all sorts and conditions of men;map-engravers, architects, shady lawyers and the agents of obscureenterprises. One house, however, second from the corner, was stilloccupied entire; and at the door of this, which wore a great air ofwealth and comfort, though it was now plunged in darkness except forthe fanlight, Mr. Utterson stopped and knocked. A well-dressed, elderlyservant opened the door.“Is Dr. Jekyll at home, Poole?” asked the lawyer.“I will see, Mr. Utterson,” said Poole, admitting the visitor, as hespoke, into a large, low-roofed, comfortable hall paved with flags,warmed (after the fashion of a country house) by a bright, open fire,and furnished with costly cabinets of oak. “Will you wait here by thefire, sir? or shall I give you a light in the dining-room?”“Here, thank you,” said the lawyer, and he drew near and leaned on thetall fender. This hall, in which he was now left alone, was a pet fancyof his friend the doctor’s; and Utterson himself was wont to speak ofit as the pleasantest room in London. But tonight there was a shudderin his blood; the face of Hyde sat heavy on his memory; he felt (whatwas rare with him) a nausea and distaste of life; and in the gloom ofhis spirits, he seemed to read a menace in the flickering of thefirelight on the polished cabinets and the uneasy starting of theshadow on the roof. He was ashamed of his relief, when Poole presentlyreturned to announce that Dr. Jekyll was gone out.“I saw Mr. Hyde go in by the old dissecting room, Poole,” he said. “Isthat right, when Dr. Jekyll is from home?”“Quite right, Mr. Utterson, sir,” replied the servant. “Mr. Hyde has akey.”“Your master seems to repose a great deal of trust in that young man,Poole,” resumed the other musingly.“Yes, sir, he does indeed,” said Poole. “We have all orders to obeyhim.”“I do not think I ever met Mr. Hyde?” asked Utterson.“O, dear no, sir. He never _dines_ here,” replied the butler. “Indeedwe see very little of him on this side of the house; he mostly comesand goes by the laboratory.”“Well, good-night, Poole.”“Good-night, Mr. Utterson.”And the lawyer set out homeward with a very heavy heart. “Poor HarryJekyll,” he thought, “my mind misgives me he is in deep waters! He waswild when he was young; a long while ago to be sure; but in the law ofGod, there is no statute of limitations. Ay, it must be that; the ghostof some old sin, the cancer of some concealed disgrace: punishmentcoming, _pede claudo_, years after memory has forgotten and self-lovecondoned the fault.” And the lawyer, scared by the thought, broodedawhile on his own past, groping in all the corners of memory, least bychance some Jack-in-the-Box of an old iniquity should leap to lightthere. His past was fairly blameless; few men could read the rolls oftheir life with less apprehension; yet he was humbled to the dust bythe many ill things he had done, and raised up again into a sober andfearful gratitude by the many he had come so near to doing yet avoided.And then by a return on his former subject, he conceived a spark ofhope. “This Master Hyde, if he were studied,” thought he, “must havesecrets of his own; black secrets, by the look of him; secrets comparedto which poor Jekyll’s worst would be like sunshine. Things cannotcontinue as they are. It turns me cold to think of this creaturestealing like a thief to Harry’s bedside; poor Harry, what a wakening!And the danger of it; for if this Hyde suspects the existence of thewill, he may grow impatient to inherit. Ay, I must put my shoulders tothe wheel—if Jekyll will but let me,” he added, “if Jekyll will onlylet me.” For once more he saw before his mind’s eye, as clear astransparency, the strange clauses of the will.DR. JEKYLL WAS QUITE AT EASEA fortnight later, by excellent good fortune, the doctor gave one ofhis pleasant dinners to some five or six old cronies, all intelligent,reputable men and all judges of good wine; and Mr. Utterson socontrived that he remained behind after the others had departed. Thiswas no new arrangement, but a thing that had befallen many scores oftimes. Where Utterson was liked, he was liked well. Hosts loved todetain the dry lawyer, when the light-hearted and loose-tongued hadalready their foot on the threshold; they liked to sit a while in hisunobtrusive company, practising for solitude, sobering their minds inthe man’s rich silence after the expense and strain of gaiety. To thisrule, Dr. Jekyll was no exception; and as he now sat on the oppositeside of the fire—a large, well-made, smooth-faced man of fifty, withsomething of a slyish cast perhaps, but every mark of capacity andkindness—you could see by his looks that he cherished for Mr. Uttersona sincere and warm affection.“I have been wanting to speak to you, Jekyll,” began the latter. “Youknow that will of yours?”A close observer might have gathered that the topic was distasteful;but the doctor carried it off gaily. “My poor Utterson,” said he, “youare unfortunate in such a client. I never saw a man so distressed asyou were by my will; unless it were that hide-bound pedant, Lanyon, atwhat he called my scientific heresies. O, I know he’s a good fellow—youneedn’t frown—an excellent fellow, and I always mean to see more ofhim; but a hide-bound pedant for all that; an ignorant, blatant pedant.I was never more disappointed in any man than Lanyon.”“You know I never approved of it,” pursued Utterson, ruthlesslydisregarding the fresh topic.“My will? Yes, certainly, I know that,” said the doctor, a triflesharply. “You have told me so.”“Well, I tell you so again,” continued the lawyer. “I have beenlearning something of young Hyde.”The large handsome face of Dr. Jekyll grew pale to the very lips, andthere came a blackness about his eyes. “I do not care to hear more,”said he. “This is a matter I thought we had agreed to drop.”“What I heard was abominable,” said Utterson.“It can make no change. You do not understand my position,” returnedthe doctor, with a certain incoherency of manner. “I am painfullysituated, Utterson; my position is a very strange—a very strange one.It is one of those affairs that cannot be mended by talking.”“Jekyll,” said Utterson, “you know me: I am a man to be trusted. Make aclean breast of this in confidence; and I make no doubt I can get youout of it.”“My good Utterson,” said the doctor, “this is very good of you, this isdownright good of you, and I cannot find words to thank you in. Ibelieve you fully; I would trust you before any man alive, ay, beforemyself, if I could make the choice; but indeed it isn’t what you fancy;it is not as bad as that; and just to put your good heart at rest, Iwill tell you one thing: the moment I choose, I can be rid of Mr. Hyde.I give you my hand upon that; and I thank you again and again; and Iwill just add one little word, Utterson, that I’m sure you’ll take ingood part: this is a private matter, and I beg of you to let it sleep.”Utterson reflected a little, looking in the fire.“I have no doubt you are perfectly right,” he said at last, getting tohis feet.“Well, but since we have touched upon this business, and for the lasttime I hope,” continued the doctor, “there is one point I should likeyou to understand. I have really a very great interest in poor Hyde. Iknow you have seen him; he told me so; and I fear he was rude. But I dosincerely take a great, a very great interest in that young man; and ifI am taken away, Utterson, I wish you to promise me that you will bearwith him and get his rights for him. I think you would, if you knewall; and it would be a weight off my mind if you would promise.”“I can’t pretend that I shall ever like him,” said the lawyer.“I don’t ask that,” pleaded Jekyll, laying his hand upon the other’sarm; “I only ask for justice; I only ask you to help him for my sake,when I am no longer here.”Utterson heaved an irrepressible sigh. “Well,” said he, “I promise.”THE CAREW MURDER CASENearly a year later, in the month of October, 18—, London was startledby a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the more notable bythe high position of the victim. The details were few and startling. Amaid servant living alone in a house not far from the river, had goneupstairs to bed about eleven. Although a fog rolled over the city inthe small hours, the early part of the night was cloudless, and thelane, which the maid’s window overlooked, was brilliantly lit by thefull moon. It seems she was romantically given, for she sat down uponher box, which stood immediately under the window, and fell into adream of musing. Never (she used to say, with streaming tears, when shenarrated that experience), never had she felt more at peace with allmen or thought more kindly of the world. And as she so sat she becameaware of an aged beautiful gentleman with white hair, drawing nearalong the lane; and advancing to meet him, another and very smallgentleman, to whom at first she paid less attention. When they had comewithin speech (which was just under the maid’s eyes) the older manbowed and accosted the other with a very pretty manner of politeness.It did not seem as if the subject of his address were of greatimportance; indeed, from his pointing, it sometimes appeared as if hewere only inquiring his way; but the moon shone on his face as hespoke, and the girl was pleased to watch it, it seemed to breathe suchan innocent and old-world kindness of disposition, yet with somethinghigh too, as of a well-founded self-content. Presently her eye wanderedto the other, and she was surprised to recognise in him a certain Mr.Hyde, who had once visited her master and for whom she had conceived adislike. He had in his hand a heavy cane, with which he was trifling;but he answered never a word, and seemed to listen with anill-contained impatience. And then all of a sudden he broke out in agreat flame of anger, stamping with his foot, brandishing the cane, andcarrying on (as the maid described it) like a madman. The old gentlemantook a step back, with the air of one very much surprised and a triflehurt; and at that Mr. Hyde broke out of all bounds and clubbed him tothe earth. And next moment, with ape-like fury, he was trampling hisvictim under foot and hailing down a storm of blows, under which thebones were audibly shattered and the body jumped upon the roadway. Atthe horror of these sights and sounds, the maid fainted.It was two o’clock when she came to herself and called for the police.The murderer was gone long ago; but there lay his victim in the middleof the lane, incredibly mangled. The stick with which the deed had beendone, although it was of some rare and very tough and heavy wood, hadbroken in the middle under the stress of this insensate cruelty; andone splintered half had rolled in the neighbouring gutter—the other,without doubt, had been carried away by the murderer. A purse and goldwatch were found upon the victim: but no cards or papers, except asealed and stamped envelope, which he had been probably carrying to thepost, and which bore the name and address of Mr. Utterson.This was brought to the lawyer the next morning, before he was out ofbed; and he had no sooner seen it and been told the circumstances, thanhe shot out a solemn lip. “I shall say nothing till I have seen thebody,” said he; “this may be very serious. Have the kindness to waitwhile I dress.” And with the same grave countenance he hurried throughhis breakfast and drove to the police station, whither the body hadbeen carried. As soon as he came into the cell, he nodded.“Yes,” said he, “I recognise him. I am sorry to say that this is SirDanvers Carew.”“Good God, sir,” exclaimed the officer, “is it possible?” And the nextmoment his eye lighted up with professional ambition. “This will make adeal of noise,” he said. “And perhaps you can help us to the man.” Andhe briefly narrated what the maid had seen, and showed the brokenstick.Mr. Utterson had already quailed at the name of Hyde; but when thestick was laid before him, he could doubt no longer; broken andbattered as it was, he recognised it for one that he had himselfpresented many years before to Henry Jekyll.“Is this Mr. Hyde a person of small stature?” he inquired.“Particularly small and particularly wicked-looking, is what the maidcalls him,” said the officer.Mr. Utterson reflected; and then, raising his head, “If you will comewith me in my cab,” he said, “I think I can take you to his house.”It was by this time about nine in the morning, and the first fog of theseason. A great chocolate-coloured pall lowered over heaven, but thewind was continually charging and routing these embattled vapours; sothat as the cab crawled from street to street, Mr. Utterson beheld amarvelous number of degrees and hues of twilight; for here it would bedark like the back-end of evening; and there would be a glow of a rich,lurid brown, like the light of some strange conflagration; and here,for a moment, the fog would be quite broken up, and a haggard shaft ofdaylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths. The dismalquarter of Soho seen under these changing glimpses, with its muddyways, and slatternly passengers, and its lamps, which had never beenextinguished or had been kindled afresh to combat this mournfulreinvasion of darkness, seemed, in the lawyer’s eyes, like a districtof some city in a nightmare. The thoughts of his mind, besides, were ofthe gloomiest dye; and when he glanced at the companion of his drive,he was conscious of some touch of that terror of the law and the law’sofficers, which may at times assail the most honest.As the cab drew up before the address indicated, the fog lifted alittle and showed him a dingy street, a gin palace, a low French eatinghouse, a shop for the retail of penny numbers and twopenny salads, manyragged children huddled in the doorways, and many women of manydifferent nationalities passing out, key in hand, to have a morningglass; and the next moment the fog settled down again upon that part,as brown as umber, and cut him off from his blackguardly surroundings.This was the home of Henry Jekyll’s favourite; of a man who was heir toa quarter of a million sterling.An ivory-faced and silvery-haired old woman opened the door. She had anevil face, smoothed by hypocrisy: but her manners were excellent. Yes,she said, this was Mr. Hyde’s, but he was not at home; he had been inthat night very late, but he had gone away again in less than an hour;there was nothing strange in that; his habits were very irregular, andhe was often absent; for instance, it was nearly two months since shehad seen him till yesterday.“Very well, then, we wish to see his rooms,” said the lawyer; and whenthe woman began to declare it was impossible, “I had better tell youwho this person is,” he added. “This is Inspector Newcomen of ScotlandYard.”A flash of odious joy appeared upon the woman’s face. “Ah!” said she,“he is in trouble! What has he done?”Mr. Utterson and the inspector exchanged glances. “He don’t seem a verypopular character,” observed the latter. “And now, my good woman, justlet me and this gentleman have a look about us.”In the whole extent of the house, which but for the old woman remainedotherwise empty, Mr. Hyde had only used a couple of rooms; but thesewere furnished with luxury and good taste. A closet was filled withwine; the plate was of silver, the napery elegant; a good picture hungupon the walls, a gift (as Utterson supposed) from Henry Jekyll, whowas much of a connoisseur; and the carpets were of many plies andagreeable in colour. At this moment, however, the rooms bore every markof having been recently and hurriedly ransacked; clothes lay about thefloor, with their pockets inside out; lock-fast drawers stood open; andon the hearth there lay a pile of grey ashes, as though many papers hadbeen burned. From these embers the inspector disinterred the butt endof a green cheque book, which had resisted the action of the fire; theother half of the stick was found behind the door; and as this clinchedhis suspicions, the officer declared himself delighted. A visit to thebank, where several thousand pounds were found to be lying to themurderer’s credit, completed his gratification.“You may depend upon it, sir,” he told Mr. Utterson: “I have him in myhand. He must have lost his head, or he never would have left the stickor, above all, burned the cheque book. Why, money’s life to the man. Wehave nothing to do but wait for him at the bank, and get out thehandbills.”This last, however, was not so easy of accomplishment; for Mr. Hyde hadnumbered few familiars—even the master of the servant maid had onlyseen him twice; his family could nowhere be traced; he had never beenphotographed; and the few who could describe him differed widely, ascommon observers will. Only on one point were they agreed; and that wasthe haunting sense of unexpressed deformity with which the fugitiveimpressed his beholders.INCIDENT OF THE LETTERIt was late in the afternoon, when Mr. Utterson found his way to Dr.Jekyll’s door, where he was at once admitted by Poole, and carried downby the kitchen offices and across a yard which had once been a garden,to the building which was indifferently known as the laboratory ordissecting rooms. The doctor had bought the house from the heirs of acelebrated surgeon; and his own tastes being rather chemical thananatomical, had changed the destination of the block at the bottom ofthe garden. It was the first time that the lawyer had been received inthat part of his friend’s quarters; and he eyed the dingy, windowlessstructure with curiosity, and gazed round with a distasteful sense ofstrangeness as he crossed the theatre, once crowded with eager studentsand now lying gaunt and silent, the tables laden with chemicalapparatus, the floor strewn with crates and littered with packingstraw, and the light falling dimly through the foggy cupola. At thefurther end, a flight of stairs mounted to a door covered with redbaize; and through this, Mr. Utterson was at last received into thedoctor’s cabinet. It was a large room fitted round with glass presses,furnished, among other things, with a cheval-glass and a businesstable, and looking out upon the court by three dusty windows barredwith iron. The fire burned in the grate; a lamp was set lighted on thechimney shelf, for even in the houses the fog began to lie thickly; andthere, close up to the warmth, sat Dr. Jekyll, looking deathly sick. Hedid not rise to meet his visitor, but held out a cold hand and bade himwelcome in a changed voice.“And now,” said Mr. Utterson, as soon as Poole had left them, “you haveheard the news?”The doctor shuddered. “They were crying it in the square,” he said. “Iheard them in my dining-room.”“One word,” said the lawyer. “Carew was my client, but so are you, andI want to know what I am doing. You have not been mad enough to hidethis fellow?”“Utterson, I swear to God,” cried the doctor, “I swear to God I willnever set eyes on him again. I bind my honour to you that I am donewith him in this world. It is all at an end. And indeed he does notwant my help; you do not know him as I do; he is safe, he is quitesafe; mark my words, he will never more be heard of.”The lawyer listened gloomily; he did not like his friend’s feverishmanner. “You seem pretty sure of him,” said he; “and for your sake, Ihope you may be right. If it came to a trial, your name might appear.”“I am quite sure of him,” replied Jekyll; “I have grounds for certaintythat I cannot share with any one. But there is one thing on which youmay advise me. I have—I have received a letter; and I am at a losswhether I should show it to the police. I should like to leave it inyour hands, Utterson; you would judge wisely, I am sure; I have sogreat a trust in you.”“You fear, I suppose, that it might lead to his detection?” asked thelawyer.“No,” said the other. “I cannot say that I care what becomes of Hyde; Iam quite done with him. I was thinking of my own character, which thishateful business has rather exposed.”Utterson ruminated awhile; he was surprised at his friend’sselfishness, and yet relieved by it. “Well,” said he, at last, “let mesee the letter.”The letter was written in an odd, upright hand and signed “EdwardHyde”: and it signified, briefly enough, that the writer’s benefactor,Dr. Jekyll, whom he had long so unworthily repaid for a thousandgenerosities, need labour under no alarm for his safety, as he hadmeans of escape on which he placed a sure dependence. The lawyer likedthis letter well enough; it put a better colour on the intimacy than hehad looked for; and he blamed himself for some of his past suspicions.“Have you the envelope?” he asked.“I burned it,” replied Jekyll, “before I thought what I was about. Butit bore no postmark. The note was handed in.”“Shall I keep this and sleep upon it?” asked Utterson.“I wish you to judge for me entirely,” was the reply. “I have lostconfidence in myself.”“Well, I shall consider,” returned the lawyer. “And now one word more:it was Hyde who dictated the terms in your will about thatdisappearance?”The doctor seemed seized with a qualm of faintness; he shut his mouthtight and nodded.“I knew it,” said Utterson. “He meant to murder you. You had a fineescape.”“I have had what is far more to the purpose,” returned the doctorsolemnly: “I have had a lesson—O God, Utterson, what a lesson I havehad!” And he covered his face for a moment with his hands.On his way out, the lawyer stopped and had a word or two with Poole.“By the bye,” said he, “there was a letter handed in to-day: what wasthe messenger like?” But Poole was positive nothing had come except bypost; “and only circulars by that,” he added.This news sent off the visitor with his fears renewed. Plainly theletter had come by the laboratory door; possibly, indeed, it had beenwritten in the cabinet; and if that were so, it must be differentlyjudged, and handled with the more caution. The newsboys, as he went,were crying themselves hoarse along the footways: “Special edition.Shocking murder of an M.P.” That was the funeral oration of one friendand client; and he could not help a certain apprehension lest the goodname of another should be sucked down in the eddy of the scandal. Itwas, at least, a ticklish decision that he had to make; andself-reliant as he was by habit, he began to cherish a longing foradvice. It was not to be had directly; but perhaps, he thought, itmight be fished for.Presently after, he sat on one side of his own hearth, with Mr. Guest,his head clerk, upon the other, and midway between, at a nicelycalculated distance from the fire, a bottle of a particular old winethat had long dwelt unsunned in the foundations of his house. The fogstill slept on the wing above the drowned city, where the lampsglimmered like carbuncles; and through the muffle and smother of thesefallen clouds, the procession of the town’s life was still rolling inthrough the great arteries with a sound as of a mighty wind. But theroom was gay with firelight. In the bottle the acids were long agoresolved; the imperial dye had softened with time, as the colour growsricher in stained windows; and the glow of hot autumn afternoons onhillside vineyards, was ready to be set free and to disperse the fogsof London. Insensibly the lawyer melted. There was no man from whom hekept fewer secrets than Mr. Guest; and he was not always sure that hekept as many as he meant. Guest had often been on business to thedoctor’s; he knew Poole; he could scarce have failed to hear of Mr.Hyde’s familiarity about the house; he might draw conclusions: was itnot as well, then, that he should see a letter which put that mysteryto right? and above all since Guest, being a great student and criticof handwriting, would consider the step natural and obliging? Theclerk, besides, was a man of counsel; he could scarce read so strange adocument without dropping a remark; and by that remark Mr. Uttersonmight shape his future course.“This is a sad business about Sir Danvers,” he said.“Yes, sir, indeed. It has elicited a great deal of public feeling,”returned Guest. “The man, of course, was mad.”“I should like to hear your views on that,” replied Utterson. “I have adocument here in his handwriting; it is between ourselves, for I scarceknow what to do about it; it is an ugly business at the best. But thereit is; quite in your way: a murderer’s autograph.”Guest’s eyes brightened, and he sat down at once and studied it withpassion. “No sir,” he said: “not mad; but it is an odd hand.”“And by all accounts a very odd writer,” added the lawyer.Just then the servant entered with a note.“Is that from Dr. Jekyll, sir?” inquired the clerk. “I thought I knewthe writing. Anything private, Mr. Utterson?”“Only an invitation to dinner. Why? Do you want to see it?”“One moment. I thank you, sir;” and the clerk laid the two sheets ofpaper alongside and sedulously compared their contents. “Thank you,sir,” he said at last, returning both; “it’s a very interestingautograph.”There was a pause, during which Mr. Utterson struggled with himself.“Why did you compare them, Guest?” he inquired suddenly.“Well, sir,” returned the clerk, “there’s a rather singularresemblance; the two hands are in many points identical: onlydifferently sloped.”“Rather quaint,” said Utterson.“It is, as you say, rather quaint,” returned Guest.“I wouldn’t speak of this note, you know,” said the master.“No, sir,” said the clerk. “I understand.”But no sooner was Mr. Utterson alone that night, than he locked thenote into his safe, where it reposed from that time forward. “What!” hethought. “Henry Jekyll forge for a murderer!” And his blood ran cold inhis veins.INCIDENT OF DR. LANYONTime ran on; thousands of pounds were offered in reward, for the deathof Sir Danvers was resented as a public injury; but Mr. Hyde haddisappeared out of the ken of the police as though he had neverexisted. Much of his past was unearthed, indeed, and all disreputable:tales came out of the man’s cruelty, at once so callous and violent; ofhis vile life, of his strange associates, of the hatred that seemed tohave surrounded his career; but of his present whereabouts, not awhisper. From the time he had left the house in Soho on the morning ofthe murder, he was simply blotted out; and gradually, as time drew on,Mr. Utterson began to recover from the hotness of his alarm, and togrow more at quiet with himself. The death of Sir Danvers was, to hisway of thinking, more than paid for by the disappearance of Mr. Hyde.Now that that evil influence had been withdrawn, a new life began forDr. Jekyll. He came out of his seclusion, renewed relations with hisfriends, became once more their familiar guest and entertainer; andwhilst he had always been known for charities, he was now no lessdistinguished for religion. He was busy, he was much in the open air,he did good; his face seemed to open and brighten, as if with an inwardconsciousness of service; and for more than two months, the doctor wasat peace.On the 8th of January Utterson had dined at the doctor’s with a smallparty; Lanyon had been there; and the face of the host had looked fromone to the other as in the old days when the trio were inseparablefriends. On the 12th, and again on the 14th, the door was shut againstthe lawyer. “The doctor was confined to the house,” Poole said, “andsaw no one.” On the 15th, he tried again, and was again refused; andhaving now been used for the last two months to see his friend almostdaily, he found this return of solitude to weigh upon his spirits. Thefifth night he had in Guest to dine with him; and the sixth he betookhimself to Dr. Lanyon’s.There at least he was not denied admittance; but when he came in, hewas shocked at the change which had taken place in the doctor’sappearance. He had his death-warrant written legibly upon his face. Therosy man had grown pale; his flesh had fallen away; he was visiblybalder and older; and yet it was not so much these tokens of a swiftphysical decay that arrested the lawyer’s notice, as a look in the eyeand quality of manner that seemed to testify to some deep-seated terrorof the mind. It was unlikely that the doctor should fear death; and yetthat was what Utterson was tempted to suspect. “Yes,” he thought; “heis a doctor, he must know his own state and that his days are counted;and the knowledge is more than he can bear.” And yet when Uttersonremarked on his ill looks, it was with an air of great firmness thatLanyon declared himself a doomed man.“I have had a shock,” he said, “and I shall never recover. It is aquestion of weeks. Well, life has been pleasant; I liked it; yes, sir,I used to like it. I sometimes think if we knew all, we should be moreglad to get away.”“Jekyll is ill, too,” observed Utterson. “Have you seen him?”But Lanyon’s face changed, and he held up a trembling hand. “I wish tosee or hear no more of Dr. Jekyll,” he said in a loud, unsteady voice.“I am quite done with that person; and I beg that you will spare me anyallusion to one whom I regard as dead.”“Tut, tut!” said Mr. Utterson; and then after a considerable pause,“Can’t I do anything?” he inquired. “We are three very old friends,Lanyon; we shall not live to make others.”“Nothing can be done,” returned Lanyon; “ask himself.”“He will not see me,” said the lawyer.“I am not surprised at that,” was the reply. “Some day, Utterson, afterI am dead, you may perhaps come to learn the right and wrong of this. Icannot tell you. And in the meantime, if you can sit and talk with meof other things, for God’s sake, stay and do so; but if you cannot keepclear of this accursed topic, then in God’s name, go, for I cannot bearit.”As soon as he got home, Utterson sat down and wrote to Jekyll,complaining of his exclusion from the house, and asking the cause ofthis unhappy break with Lanyon; and the next day brought him a longanswer, often very pathetically worded, and sometimes darkly mysteriousin drift. The quarrel with Lanyon was incurable. “I do not blame ourold friend,” Jekyll wrote, “but I share his view that we must nevermeet. I mean from henceforth to lead a life of extreme seclusion; youmust not be surprised, nor must you doubt my friendship, if my door isoften shut even to you. You must suffer me to go my own dark way. Ihave brought on myself a punishment and a danger that I cannot name. IfI am the chief of sinners, I am the chief of sufferers also. I couldnot think that this earth contained a place for sufferings and terrorsso unmanning; and you can do but one thing, Utterson, to lighten thisdestiny, and that is to respect my silence.” Utterson was amazed; thedark influence of Hyde had been withdrawn, the doctor had returned tohis old tasks and amities; a week ago, the prospect had smiled withevery promise of a cheerful and an honoured age; and now in a moment,friendship, and peace of mind, and the whole tenor of his life werewrecked. So great and unprepared a change pointed to madness; but inview of Lanyon’s manner and words, there must lie for it some deeperground.A week afterwards Dr. Lanyon took to his bed, and in something lessthan a fortnight he was dead. The night after the funeral, at which hehad been sadly affected, Utterson locked the door of his business room,and sitting there by the light of a melancholy candle, drew out and setbefore him an envelope addressed by the hand and sealed with the sealof his dead friend. “PRIVATE: for the hands of G. J. Utterson ALONE,and in case of his predecease _to be destroyed unread_,” so it wasemphatically superscribed; and the lawyer dreaded to behold thecontents. “I have buried one friend to-day,” he thought: “what if thisshould cost me another?” And then he condemned the fear as adisloyalty, and broke the seal. Within there was another enclosure,likewise sealed, and marked upon the cover as “not to be opened tillthe death or disappearance of Dr. Henry Jekyll.” Utterson could nottrust his eyes. Yes, it was disappearance; here again, as in the madwill which he had long ago restored to its author, here again were theidea of a disappearance and the name of Henry Jekyll bracketted. But inthe will, that idea had sprung from the sinister suggestion of the manHyde; it was set there with a purpose all too plain and horrible.Written by the hand of Lanyon, what should it mean? A great curiositycame on the trustee, to disregard the prohibition and dive at once tothe bottom of these mysteries; but professional honour and faith to hisdead friend were stringent obligations; and the packet slept in theinmost corner of his private safe.It is one thing to mortify curiosity, another to conquer it; and it maybe doubted if, from that day forth, Utterson desired the society of hissurviving friend with the same eagerness. He thought of him kindly; buthis thoughts were disquieted and fearful. He went to call indeed; buthe was perhaps relieved to be denied admittance; perhaps, in his heart,he preferred to speak with Poole upon the doorstep and surrounded bythe air and sounds of the open city, rather than to be admitted intothat house of voluntary bondage, and to sit and speak with itsinscrutable recluse. Poole had, indeed, no very pleasant news tocommunicate. The doctor, it appeared, now more than ever confinedhimself to the cabinet over the laboratory, where he would sometimeseven sleep; he was out of spirits, he had grown very silent, he did notread; it seemed as if he had something on his mind. Utterson became soused to the unvarying character of these reports, that he fell offlittle by little in the frequency of his visits.INCIDENT AT THE WINDOWIt chanced on Sunday, when Mr. Utterson was on his usual walk with Mr.Enfield, that their way lay once again through the by-street; and thatwhen they came in front of the door, both stopped to gaze on it.“Well,” said Enfield, “that story’s at an end at least. We shall neversee more of Mr. Hyde.”“I hope not,” said Utterson. “Did I ever tell you that I once saw him,and shared your feeling of repulsion?”“It was impossible to do the one without the other,” returned Enfield.“And by the way, what an ass you must have thought me, not to know thatthis was a back way to Dr. Jekyll’s! It was partly your own fault thatI found it out, even when I did.”“So you found it out, did you?” said Utterson. “But if that be so, wemay step into the court and take a look at the windows. To tell you thetruth, I am uneasy about poor Jekyll; and even outside, I feel as ifthe presence of a friend might do him good.”The court was very cool and a little damp, and full of prematuretwilight, although the sky, high up overhead, was still bright withsunset. The middle one of the three windows was half-way open; andsitting close beside it, taking the air with an infinite sadness ofmien, like some disconsolate prisoner, Utterson saw Dr. Jekyll.“What! Jekyll!” he cried. “I trust you are better.”“I am very low, Utterson,” replied the doctor drearily, “very low. Itwill not last long, thank God.”“You stay too much indoors,” said the lawyer. “You should be out,whipping up the circulation like Mr. Enfield and me. (This is mycousin—Mr. Enfield—Dr. Jekyll.) Come now; get your hat and take a quickturn with us.”“You are very good,” sighed the other. “I should like to very much; butno, no, no, it is quite impossible; I dare not. But indeed, Utterson, Iam very glad to see you; this is really a great pleasure; I would askyou and Mr. Enfield up, but the place is really not fit.”“Why, then,” said the lawyer, good-naturedly, “the best thing we can dois to stay down here and speak with you from where we are.”“That is just what I was about to venture to propose,” returned thedoctor with a smile. But the words were hardly uttered, before thesmile was struck out of his face and succeeded by an expression of suchabject terror and despair, as froze the very blood of the two gentlemenbelow. They saw it but for a glimpse for the window was instantlythrust down; but that glimpse had been sufficient, and they turned andleft the court without a word. In silence, too, they traversed theby-street; and it was not until they had come into a neighbouringthoroughfare, where even upon a Sunday there were still some stirringsof life, that Mr. Utterson at last turned and looked at his companion.They were both pale; and there was an answering horror in their eyes.“God forgive us, God forgive us,” said Mr. Utterson.But Mr. Enfield only nodded his head very seriously, and walked on oncemore in silence.THE LAST NIGHTMr. Utterson was sitting by his fireside one evening after dinner, whenhe was surprised to receive a visit from Poole.“Bless me, Poole, what brings you here?” he cried; and then taking asecond look at him, “What ails you?” he added; “is the doctor ill?”“Mr. Utterson,” said the man, “there is something wrong.”“Take a seat, and here is a glass of wine for you,” said the lawyer.“Now, take your time, and tell me plainly what you want.”“You know the doctor’s ways, sir,” replied Poole, “and how he shutshimself up. Well, he’s shut up again in the cabinet; and I don’t likeit, sir—I wish I may die if I like it. Mr. Utterson, sir, I’m afraid.”“Now, my good man,” said the lawyer, “be explicit. What are you afraidof?”“I’ve been afraid for about a week,” returned Poole, doggedlydisregarding the question, “and I can bear it no more.”The man’s appearance amply bore out his words; his manner was alteredfor the worse; and except for the moment when he had first announcedhis terror, he had not once looked the lawyer in the face. Even now, hesat with the glass of wine untasted on his knee, and his eyes directedto a corner of the floor. “I can bear it no more,” he repeated.“Come,” said the lawyer, “I see you have some good reason, Poole; I seethere is something seriously amiss. Try to tell me what it is.”“I think there’s been foul play,” said Poole, hoarsely.“Foul play!” cried the lawyer, a good deal frightened and ratherinclined to be irritated in consequence. “What foul play! What does theman mean?”“I daren’t say, sir,” was the answer; “but will you come along with meand see for yourself?”Mr. Utterson’s only answer was to rise and get his hat and greatcoat;but he observed with wonder the greatness of the relief that appearedupon the butler’s face, and perhaps with no less, that the wine wasstill untasted when he set it down to follow.It was a wild, cold, seasonable night of March, with a pale moon, lyingon her back as though the wind had tilted her, and flying wrack of themost diaphanous and lawny texture. The wind made talking difficult, andflecked the blood into the face. It seemed to have swept the streetsunusually bare of passengers, besides; for Mr. Utterson thought he hadnever seen that part of London so deserted. He could have wished itotherwise; never in his life had he been conscious of so sharp a wishto see and touch his fellow-creatures; for struggle as he might, therewas borne in upon his mind a crushing anticipation of calamity. Thesquare, when they got there, was full of wind and dust, and the thintrees in the garden were lashing themselves along the railing. Poole,who had kept all the way a pace or two ahead, now pulled up in themiddle of the pavement, and in spite of the biting weather, took offhis hat and mopped his brow with a red pocket-handkerchief. But for allthe hurry of his coming, these were not the dews of exertion that hewiped away, but the moisture of some strangling anguish; for his facewas white and his voice, when he spoke, harsh and broken.“Well, sir,” he said, “here we are, and God grant there be nothingwrong.”“Amen, Poole,” said the lawyer.Thereupon the servant knocked in a very guarded manner; the door wasopened on the chain; and a voice asked from within, “Is that you,Poole?”“It’s all right,” said Poole. “Open the door.”The hall, when they entered it, was brightly lighted up; the fire wasbuilt high; and about the hearth the whole of the servants, men andwomen, stood huddled together like a flock of sheep. At the sight ofMr. Utterson, the housemaid broke into hysterical whimpering; and thecook, crying out “Bless God! it’s Mr. Utterson,” ran forward as if totake him in her arms.“What, what? Are you all here?” said the lawyer peevishly. “Veryirregular, very unseemly; your master would be far from pleased.”“They’re all afraid,” said Poole.Blank silence followed, no one protesting; only the maid lifted hervoice and now wept loudly.“Hold your tongue!” Poole said to her, with a ferocity of accent thattestified to his own jangled nerves; and indeed, when the girl had sosuddenly raised the note of her lamentation, they had all started andturned towards the inner door with faces of dreadful expectation. “Andnow,” continued the butler, addressing the knife-boy, “reach me acandle, and we’ll get this through hands at once.” And then he beggedMr. Utterson to follow him, and led the way to the back garden.“Now, sir,” said he, “you come as gently as you can. I want you tohear, and I don’t want you to be heard. And see here, sir, if by anychance he was to ask you in, don’t go.”Mr. Utterson’s nerves, at this unlooked-for termination, gave a jerkthat nearly threw him from his balance; but he recollected his courageand followed the butler into the laboratory building through thesurgical theatre, with its lumber of crates and bottles, to the foot ofthe stair. Here Poole motioned him to stand on one side and listen;while he himself, setting down the candle and making a great andobvious call on his resolution, mounted the steps and knocked with asomewhat uncertain hand on the red baize of the cabinet door.“Mr. Utterson, sir, asking to see you,” he called; and even as he didso, once more violently signed to the lawyer to give ear.A voice answered from within: “Tell him I cannot see anyone,” it saidcomplainingly.“Thank you, sir,” said Poole, with a note of something like triumph inhis voice; and taking up his candle, he led Mr. Utterson back acrossthe yard and into the great kitchen, where the fire was out and thebeetles were leaping on the floor.“Sir,” he said, looking Mr. Utterson in the eyes, “Was that my master’svoice?”“It seems much changed,” replied the lawyer, very pale, but giving lookfor look.“Changed? Well, yes, I think so,” said the butler. “Have I been twentyyears in this man’s house, to be deceived about his voice? No, sir;master’s made away with; he was made away with eight days ago, when weheard him cry out upon the name of God; and _who’s_ in there instead ofhim, and _why_ it stays there, is a thing that cries to Heaven, Mr.Utterson!”“This is a very strange tale, Poole; this is rather a wild tale myman,” said Mr. Utterson, biting his finger. “Suppose it were as yousuppose, supposing Dr. Jekyll to have been—well, murdered, what couldinduce the murderer to stay? That won’t hold water; it doesn’t commenditself to reason.”“Well, Mr. Utterson, you are a hard man to satisfy, but I’ll do ityet,” said Poole. “All this last week (you must know) him, or it,whatever it is that lives in that cabinet, has been crying night andday for some sort of medicine and cannot get it to his mind. It wassometimes his way—the master’s, that is—to write his orders on a sheetof paper and throw it on the stair. We’ve had nothing else this weekback; nothing but papers, and a closed door, and the very meals leftthere to be smuggled in when nobody was looking. Well, sir, every day,ay, and twice and thrice in the same day, there have been orders andcomplaints, and I have been sent flying to all the wholesale chemistsin town. Every time I brought the stuff back, there would be anotherpaper telling me to return it, because it was not pure, and anotherorder to a different firm. This drug is wanted bitter bad, sir,whatever for.”“Have you any of these papers?” asked Mr. Utterson.Poole felt in his pocket and handed out a crumpled note, which thelawyer, bending nearer to the candle, carefully examined. Its contentsran thus: “Dr. Jekyll presents his compliments to Messrs. Maw. Heassures them that their last sample is impure and quite useless for hispresent purpose. In the year 18—, Dr. J. purchased a somewhat largequantity from Messrs. M. He now begs them to search with most sedulouscare, and should any of the same quality be left, forward it to him atonce. Expense is no consideration. The importance of this to Dr. J. canhardly be exaggerated.” So far the letter had run composedly enough,but here with a sudden splutter of the pen, the writer’s emotion hadbroken loose. “For God’s sake,” he added, “find me some of the old.”“This is a strange note,” said Mr. Utterson; and then sharply, “How doyou come to have it open?”“The man at Maw’s was main angry, sir, and he threw it back to me likeso much dirt,” returned Poole.“This is unquestionably the doctor’s hand, do you know?” resumed thelawyer.“I thought it looked like it,” said the servant rather sulkily; andthen, with another voice, “But what matters hand of write?” he said.“I’ve seen him!”“Seen him?” repeated Mr. Utterson. “Well?”“That’s it!” said Poole. “It was this way. I came suddenly into thetheatre from the garden. It seems he had slipped out to look for thisdrug or whatever it is; for the cabinet door was open, and there he wasat the far end of the room digging among the crates. He looked up whenI came in, gave a kind of cry, and whipped upstairs into the cabinet.It was but for one minute that I saw him, but the hair stood upon myhead like quills. Sir, if that was my master, why had he a mask uponhis face? If it was my master, why did he cry out like a rat, and runfrom me? I have served him long enough. And then...” The man paused andpassed his hand over his face.“These are all very strange circumstances,” said Mr. Utterson, “but Ithink I begin to see daylight. Your master, Poole, is plainly seizedwith one of those maladies that both torture and deform the sufferer;hence, for aught I know, the alteration of his voice; hence the maskand the avoidance of his friends; hence his eagerness to find thisdrug, by means of which the poor soul retains some hope of ultimaterecovery—God grant that he be not deceived! There is my explanation; itis sad enough, Poole, ay, and appalling to consider; but it is plainand natural, hangs well together, and delivers us from all exorbitantalarms.”“Sir,” said the butler, turning to a sort of mottled pallor, “thatthing was not my master, and there’s the truth. My master”—here helooked round him and began to whisper—“is a tall, fine build of a man,and this was more of a dwarf.” Utterson attempted to protest. “O, sir,”cried Poole, “do you think I do not know my master after twenty years?Do you think I do not know where his head comes to in the cabinet door,where I saw him every morning of my life? No, sir, that thing in themask was never Dr. Jekyll—God knows what it was, but it was never Dr.Jekyll; and it is the belief of my heart that there was murder done.”“Poole,” replied the lawyer, “if you say that, it will become my dutyto make certain. Much as I desire to spare your master’s feelings, muchas I am puzzled by this note which seems to prove him to be stillalive, I shall consider it my duty to break in that door.”“Ah, Mr. Utterson, that’s talking!” cried the butler.“And now comes the second question,” resumed Utterson: “Who is going todo it?”“Why, you and me, sir,” was the undaunted reply.“That’s very well said,” returned the lawyer; “and whatever comes ofit, I shall make it my business to see you are no loser.”“There is an axe in the theatre,” continued Poole; “and you might takethe kitchen poker for yourself.”The lawyer took that rude but weighty instrument into his hand, andbalanced it. “Do you know, Poole,” he said, looking up, “that you and Iare about to place ourselves in a position of some peril?”“You may say so, sir, indeed,” returned the butler.“It is well, then that we should be frank,” said the other. “We boththink more than we have said; let us make a clean breast. This maskedfigure that you saw, did you recognise it?”“Well, sir, it went so quick, and the creature was so doubled up, thatI could hardly swear to that,” was the answer. “But if you mean, was itMr. Hyde?—why, yes, I think it was! You see, it was much of the samebigness; and it had the same quick, light way with it; and then whoelse could have got in by the laboratory door? You have not forgot,sir, that at the time of the murder he had still the key with him? Butthat’s not all. I don’t know, Mr. Utterson, if you ever met this Mr.Hyde?”“Yes,” said the lawyer, “I once spoke with him.”“Then you must know as well as the rest of us that there was somethingqueer about that gentleman—something that gave a man a turn—I don’tknow rightly how to say it, sir, beyond this: that you felt in yourmarrow kind of cold and thin.”“I own I felt something of what you describe,” said Mr. Utterson.“Quite so, sir,” returned Poole. “Well, when that masked thing like amonkey jumped from among the chemicals and whipped into the cabinet, itwent down my spine like ice. O, I know it’s not evidence, Mr. Utterson;I’m book-learned enough for that; but a man has his feelings, and Igive you my bible-word it was Mr. Hyde!”“Ay, ay,” said the lawyer. “My fears incline to the same point. Evil, Ifear, founded—evil was sure to come—of that connection. Ay truly, Ibelieve you; I believe poor Harry is killed; and I believe his murderer(for what purpose, God alone can tell) is still lurking in his victim’sroom. Well, let our name be vengeance. Call Bradshaw.”The footman came at the summons, very white and nervous.“Pull yourself together, Bradshaw,” said the lawyer. “This suspense, Iknow, is telling upon all of you; but it is now our intention to makean end of it. Poole, here, and I are going to force our way into thecabinet. If all is well, my shoulders are broad enough to bear theblame. Meanwhile, lest anything should really be amiss, or anymalefactor seek to escape by the back, you and the boy must go roundthe corner with a pair of good sticks and take your post at thelaboratory door. We give you ten minutes to get to your stations.”As Bradshaw left, the lawyer looked at his watch. “And now, Poole, letus get to ours,” he said; and taking the poker under his arm, led theway into the yard. The scud had banked over the moon, and it was nowquite dark. The wind, which only broke in puffs and draughts into thatdeep well of building, tossed the light of the candle to and fro abouttheir steps, until they came into the shelter of the theatre, wherethey sat down silently to wait. London hummed solemnly all around; butnearer at hand, the stillness was only broken by the sounds of afootfall moving to and fro along the cabinet floor.“So it will walk all day, sir,” whispered Poole; “ay, and the betterpart of the night. Only when a new sample comes from the chemist,there’s a bit of a break. Ah, it’s an ill conscience that’s such anenemy to rest! Ah, sir, there’s blood foully shed in every step of it!But hark again, a little closer—put your heart in your ears, Mr.Utterson, and tell me, is that the doctor’s foot?”The steps fell lightly and oddly, with a certain swing, for all theywent so slowly; it was different indeed from the heavy creaking treadof Henry Jekyll. Utterson sighed. “Is there never anything else?” heasked.Poole nodded. “Once,” he said. “Once I heard it weeping!”“Weeping? how that?” said the lawyer, conscious of a sudden chill ofhorror.“Weeping like a woman or a lost soul,” said the butler. “I came awaywith that upon my heart, that I could have wept too.”But now the ten minutes drew to an end. Poole disinterred the axe fromunder a stack of packing straw; the candle was set upon the nearesttable to light them to the attack; and they drew near with bated breathto where that patient foot was still going up and down, up and down, inthe quiet of the night.“Jekyll,” cried Utterson, with a loud voice, “I demand to see you.” Hepaused a moment, but there came no reply. “I give you fair warning, oursuspicions are aroused, and I must and shall see you,” he resumed; “ifnot by fair means, then by foul—if not of your consent, then by bruteforce!”“Utterson,” said the voice, “for God’s sake, have mercy!”“Ah, that’s not Jekyll’s voice—it’s Hyde’s!” cried Utterson. “Down withthe door, Poole!”Poole swung the axe over his shoulder; the blow shook the building, andthe red baize door leaped against the lock and hinges. A dismalscreech, as of mere animal terror, rang from the cabinet. Up went theaxe again, and again the panels crashed and the frame bounded; fourtimes the blow fell; but the wood was tough and the fittings were ofexcellent workmanship; and it was not until the fifth, that the lockburst and the wreck of the door fell inwards on the carpet.The besiegers, appalled by their own riot and the stillness that hadsucceeded, stood back a little and peered in. There lay the cabinetbefore their eyes in the quiet lamplight, a good fire glowing andchattering on the hearth, the kettle singing its thin strain, a draweror two open, papers neatly set forth on the business table, and nearerthe fire, the things laid out for tea; the quietest room, you wouldhave said, and, but for the glazed presses full of chemicals, the mostcommonplace that night in London.Right in the middle there lay the body of a man sorely contorted andstill twitching. They drew near on tiptoe, turned it on its back andbeheld the face of Edward Hyde. He was dressed in clothes far too largefor him, clothes of the doctor’s bigness; the cords of his face stillmoved with a semblance of life, but life was quite gone; and by thecrushed phial in the hand and the strong smell of kernels that hungupon the air, Utterson knew that he was looking on the body of aself-destroyer.“We have come too late,” he said sternly, “whether to save or punish.Hyde is gone to his account; and it only remains for us to find thebody of your master.”The far greater proportion of the building was occupied by the theatre,which filled almost the whole ground storey and was lighted from above,and by the cabinet, which formed an upper storey at one end and lookedupon the court. A corridor joined the theatre to the door on theby-street; and with this the cabinet communicated separately by asecond flight of stairs. There were besides a few dark closets and aspacious cellar. All these they now thoroughly examined. Each closetneeded but a glance, for all were empty, and all, by the dust that fellfrom their doors, had stood long unopened. The cellar, indeed, wasfilled with crazy lumber, mostly dating from the times of the surgeonwho was Jekyll’s predecessor; but even as they opened the door theywere advertised of the uselessness of further search, by the fall of aperfect mat of cobweb which had for years sealed up the entrance.Nowhere was there any trace of Henry Jekyll, dead or alive.Poole stamped on the flags of the corridor. “He must be buried here,”he said, hearkening to the sound.“Or he may have fled,” said Utterson, and he turned to examine the doorin the by-street. It was locked; and lying near by on the flags, theyfound the key, already stained with rust.“This does not look like use,” observed the lawyer.“Use!” echoed Poole. “Do you not see, sir, it is broken? much as if aman had stamped on it.”“Ay,” continued Utterson, “and the fractures, too, are rusty.” The twomen looked at each other with a scare. “This is beyond me, Poole,” saidthe lawyer. “Let us go back to the cabinet.”They mounted the stair in silence, and still with an occasionalawestruck glance at the dead body, proceeded more thoroughly to examinethe contents of the cabinet. At one table, there were traces ofchemical work, various measured heaps of some white salt being laid onglass saucers, as though for an experiment in which the unhappy man hadbeen prevented.“That is the same drug that I was always bringing him,” said Poole; andeven as he spoke, the kettle with a startling noise boiled over.This brought them to the fireside, where the easy-chair was drawncosily up, and the tea things stood ready to the sitter’s elbow, thevery sugar in the cup. There were several books on a shelf; one laybeside the tea things open, and Utterson was amazed to find it a copyof a pious work, for which Jekyll had several times expressed a greatesteem, annotated, in his own hand with startling blasphemies.Next, in the course of their review of the chamber, the searchers cameto the cheval-glass, into whose depths they looked with an involuntaryhorror. But it was so turned as to show them nothing but the rosy glowplaying on the roof, the fire sparkling in a hundred repetitions alongthe glazed front of the presses, and their own pale and fearfulcountenances stooping to look in.“This glass has seen some strange things, sir,” whispered Poole.“And surely none stranger than itself,” echoed the lawyer in the sametones. “For what did Jekyll”—he caught himself up at the word with astart, and then conquering the weakness—“what could Jekyll want withit?” he said.“You may say that!” said Poole.Next they turned to the business table. On the desk, among the neatarray of papers, a large envelope was uppermost, and bore, in thedoctor’s hand, the name of Mr. Utterson. The lawyer unsealed it, andseveral enclosures fell to the floor. The first was a will, drawn inthe same eccentric terms as the one which he had returned six monthsbefore, to serve as a testament in case of death and as a deed of giftin case of disappearance; but in place of the name of Edward Hyde, thelawyer, with indescribable amazement read the name of Gabriel JohnUtterson. He looked at Poole, and then back at the paper, and last ofall at the dead malefactor stretched upon the carpet.“My head goes round,” he said. “He has been all these days inpossession; he had no cause to like me; he must have raged to seehimself displaced; and he has not destroyed this document.”He caught up the next paper; it was a brief note in the doctor’s handand dated at the top. “O Poole!” the lawyer cried, “he was alive andhere this day. He cannot have been disposed of in so short a space; hemust be still alive, he must have fled! And then, why fled? and how?and in that case, can we venture to declare this suicide? O, we must becareful. I foresee that we may yet involve your master in some direcatastrophe.”“Why don’t you read it, sir?” asked Poole.“Because I fear,” replied the lawyer solemnly. “God grant I have nocause for it!” And with that he brought the paper to his eyes and readas follows:“My dear Utterson,—When this shall fall into your hands, I shall havedisappeared, under what circumstances I have not the penetration toforesee, but my instinct and all the circumstances of my namelesssituation tell me that the end is sure and must be early. Go then, andfirst read the narrative which Lanyon warned me he was to place in yourhands; and if you care to hear more, turn to the confession of“Your unworthy and unhappy friend,“HENRY JEKYLL.”“There was a third enclosure?” asked Utterson.“Here, sir,” said Poole, and gave into his hands a considerable packetsealed in several places.The lawyer put it in his pocket. “I would say nothing of this paper. Ifyour master has fled or is dead, we may at least save his credit. It isnow ten; I must go home and read these documents in quiet; but I shallbe back before midnight, when we shall send for the police.”They went out, locking the door of the theatre behind them; andUtterson, once more leaving the servants gathered about the fire in thehall, trudged back to his office to read the two narratives in whichthis mystery was now to be explained.DR. LANYON’S NARRATIVEOn the ninth of January, now four days ago, I received by the eveningdelivery a registered envelope, addressed in the hand of my colleagueand old school companion, Henry Jekyll. I was a good deal surprised bythis; for we were by no means in the habit of correspondence; I hadseen the man, dined with him, indeed, the night before; and I couldimagine nothing in our intercourse that should justify formality ofregistration. The contents increased my wonder; for this is how theletter ran:“10_th December_, 18—.“Dear Lanyon,—You are one of my oldest friends; and although we mayhave differed at times on scientific questions, I cannot remember, atleast on my side, any break in our affection. There was never a daywhen, if you had said to me, ‘Jekyll, my life, my honour, my reason,depend upon you,’ I would not have sacrificed my left hand to help you.Lanyon, my life, my honour, my reason, are all at your mercy; if youfail me to-night, I am lost. You might suppose, after this preface,that I am going to ask you for something dishonourable to grant. Judgefor yourself.“I want you to postpone all other engagements for to-night—ay, even ifyou were summoned to the bedside of an emperor; to take a cab, unlessyour carriage should be actually at the door; and with this letter inyour hand for consultation, to drive straight to my house. Poole, mybutler, has his orders; you will find him waiting your arrival with alocksmith. The door of my cabinet is then to be forced; and you are togo in alone; to open the glazed press (letter E) on the left hand,breaking the lock if it be shut; and to draw out, _with all itscontents as they stand_, the fourth drawer from the top or (which isthe same thing) the third from the bottom. In my extreme distress ofmind, I have a morbid fear of misdirecting you; but even if I am inerror, you may know the right drawer by its contents: some powders, aphial and a paper book. This drawer I beg of you to carry back with youto Cavendish Square exactly as it stands.“That is the first part of the service: now for the second. You shouldbe back, if you set out at once on the receipt of this, long beforemidnight; but I will leave you that amount of margin, not only in thefear of one of those obstacles that can neither be prevented norforeseen, but because an hour when your servants are in bed is to bepreferred for what will then remain to do. At midnight, then, I have toask you to be alone in your consulting room, to admit with your ownhand into the house a man who will present himself in my name, and toplace in his hands the drawer that you will have brought with you frommy cabinet. Then you will have played your part and earned my gratitudecompletely. Five minutes afterwards, if you insist upon an explanation,you will have understood that these arrangements are of capitalimportance; and that by the neglect of one of them, fantastic as theymust appear, you might have charged your conscience with my death orthe shipwreck of my reason.“Confident as I am that you will not trifle with this appeal, my heartsinks and my hand trembles at the bare thought of such a possibility.Think of me at this hour, in a strange place, labouring under ablackness of distress that no fancy can exaggerate, and yet well awarethat, if you will but punctually serve me, my troubles will roll awaylike a story that is told. Serve me, my dear Lanyon and save“Your friend,“H.J.“P.S.—I had already sealed this up when a fresh terror struck upon mysoul. It is possible that the post-office may fail me, and this letternot come into your hands until to-morrow morning. In that case, dearLanyon, do my errand when it shall be most convenient for you in thecourse of the day; and once more expect my messenger at midnight. Itmay then already be too late; and if that night passes without event,you will know that you have seen the last of Henry Jekyll.”Upon the reading of this letter, I made sure my colleague was insane;but till that was proved beyond the possibility of doubt, I felt boundto do as he requested. The less I understood of this farrago, the lessI was in a position to judge of its importance; and an appeal so wordedcould not be set aside without a grave responsibility. I roseaccordingly from table, got into a hansom, and drove straight toJekyll’s house. The butler was awaiting my arrival; he had received bythe same post as mine a registered letter of instruction, and had sentat once for a locksmith and a carpenter. The tradesmen came while wewere yet speaking; and we moved in a body to old Dr. Denman’s surgicaltheatre, from which (as you are doubtless aware) Jekyll’s privatecabinet is most conveniently entered. The door was very strong, thelock excellent; the carpenter avowed he would have great trouble andhave to do much damage, if force were to be used; and the locksmith wasnear despair. But this last was a handy fellow, and after two hour’swork, the door stood open. The press marked E was unlocked; and I tookout the drawer, had it filled up with straw and tied in a sheet, andreturned with it to Cavendish Square.Here I proceeded to examine its contents. The powders were neatlyenough made up, but not with the nicety of the dispensing chemist; sothat it was plain they were of Jekyll’s private manufacture; and when Iopened one of the wrappers I found what seemed to me a simplecrystalline salt of a white colour. The phial, to which I next turnedmy attention, might have been about half full of a blood-red liquor,which was highly pungent to the sense of smell and seemed to me tocontain phosphorus and some volatile ether. At the other ingredients Icould make no guess. The book was an ordinary version book andcontained little but a series of dates. These covered a period of manyyears, but I observed that the entries ceased nearly a year ago andquite abruptly. Here and there a brief remark was appended to a date,usually no more than a single word: “double” occurring perhaps sixtimes in a total of several hundred entries; and once very early in thelist and followed by several marks of exclamation, “total failure!!!”All this, though it whetted my curiosity, told me little that wasdefinite. Here were a phial of some salt, and the record of a series ofexperiments that had led (like too many of Jekyll’s investigations) tono end of practical usefulness. How could the presence of thesearticles in my house affect either the honour, the sanity, or the lifeof my flighty colleague? If his messenger could go to one place, whycould he not go to another? And even granting some impediment, why wasthis gentleman to be received by me in secret? The more I reflected themore convinced I grew that I was dealing with a case of cerebraldisease; and though I dismissed my servants to bed, I loaded an oldrevolver, that I might be found in some posture of self-defence.Twelve o’clock had scarce rung out over London, ere the knocker soundedvery gently on the door. I went myself at the summons, and found asmall man crouching against the pillars of the portico.“Are you come from Dr. Jekyll?” I asked.He told me “yes” by a constrained gesture; and when I had bidden himenter, he did not obey me without a searching backward glance into thedarkness of the square. There was a policeman not far off, advancingwith his bull’s eye open; and at the sight, I thought my visitorstarted and made greater haste.These particulars struck me, I confess, disagreeably; and as I followedhim into the bright light of the consulting room, I kept my hand readyon my weapon. Here, at last, I had a chance of clearly seeing him. Ihad never set eyes on him before, so much was certain. He was small, asI have said; I was struck besides with the shocking expression of hisface, with his remarkable combination of great muscular activity andgreat apparent debility of constitution, and—last but not least—withthe odd, subjective disturbance caused by his neighbourhood. This boresome resemblance to incipient rigour, and was accompanied by a markedsinking of the pulse. At the time, I set it down to some idiosyncratic,personal distaste, and merely wondered at the acuteness of thesymptoms; but I have since had reason to believe the cause to lie muchdeeper in the nature of man, and to turn on some nobler hinge than theprinciple of hatred.This person (who had thus, from the first moment of his entrance,struck in me what I can only describe as a disgustful curiosity) wasdressed in a fashion that would have made an ordinary person laughable;his clothes, that is to say, although they were of rich and soberfabric, were enormously too large for him in every measurement—thetrousers hanging on his legs and rolled up to keep them from theground, the waist of the coat below his haunches, and the collarsprawling wide upon his shoulders. Strange to relate, this ludicrousaccoutrement was far from moving me to laughter. Rather, as there wassomething abnormal and misbegotten in the very essence of the creaturethat now faced me—something seizing, surprising and revolting—thisfresh disparity seemed but to fit in with and to reinforce it; so thatto my interest in the man’s nature and character, there was added acuriosity as to his origin, his life, his fortune and status in theworld.These observations, though they have taken so great a space to be setdown in, were yet the work of a few seconds. My visitor was, indeed, onfire with sombre excitement.“Have you got it?” he cried. “Have you got it?” And so lively was hisimpatience that he even laid his hand upon my arm and sought to shakeme.I put him back, conscious at his touch of a certain icy pang along myblood. “Come, sir,” said I. “You forget that I have not yet thepleasure of your acquaintance. Be seated, if you please.” And I showedhim an example, and sat down myself in my customary seat and with asfair an imitation of my ordinary manner to a patient, as the latenessof the hour, the nature of my preoccupations, and the horror I had ofmy visitor, would suffer me to muster.“I beg your pardon, Dr. Lanyon,” he replied civilly enough. “What yousay is very well founded; and my impatience has shown its heels to mypoliteness. I come here at the instance of your colleague, Dr. HenryJekyll, on a piece of business of some moment; and I understood...” Hepaused and put his hand to his throat, and I could see, in spite of hiscollected manner, that he was wrestling against the approaches of thehysteria—“I understood, a drawer...”But here I took pity on my visitor’s suspense, and some perhaps on myown growing curiosity.“There it is, sir,” said I, pointing to the drawer, where it lay on thefloor behind a table and still covered with the sheet.He sprang to it, and then paused, and laid his hand upon his heart; Icould hear his teeth grate with the convulsive action of his jaws; andhis face was so ghastly to see that I grew alarmed both for his lifeand reason.“Compose yourself,” said I.He turned a dreadful smile to me, and as if with the decision ofdespair, plucked away the sheet. At sight of the contents, he utteredone loud sob of such immense relief that I sat petrified. And the nextmoment, in a voice that was already fairly well under control, “Haveyou a graduated glass?” he asked.I rose from my place with something of an effort and gave him what heasked.He thanked me with a smiling nod, measured out a few minims of the redtincture and added one of the powders. The mixture, which was at firstof a reddish hue, began, in proportion as the crystals melted, tobrighten in colour, to effervesce audibly, and to throw off small fumesof vapour. Suddenly and at the same moment, the ebullition ceased andthe compound changed to a dark purple, which faded again more slowly toa watery green. My visitor, who had watched these metamorphoses with akeen eye, smiled, set down the glass upon the table, and then turnedand looked upon me with an air of scrutiny.“And now,” said he, “to settle what remains. Will you be wise? will yoube guided? will you suffer me to take this glass in my hand and to goforth from your house without further parley? or has the greed ofcuriosity too much command of you? Think before you answer, for itshall be done as you decide. As you decide, you shall be left as youwere before, and neither richer nor wiser, unless the sense of servicerendered to a man in mortal distress may be counted as a kind of richesof the soul. Or, if you shall so prefer to choose, a new province ofknowledge and new avenues to fame and power shall be laid open to you,here, in this room, upon the instant; and your sight shall be blastedby a prodigy to stagger the unbelief of Satan.”“Sir,” said I, affecting a coolness that I was far from trulypossessing, “you speak enigmas, and you will perhaps not wonder that Ihear you with no very strong impression of belief. But I have gone toofar in the way of inexplicable services to pause before I see the end.”“It is well,” replied my visitor. “Lanyon, you remember your vows: whatfollows is under the seal of our profession. And now, you who have solong been bound to the most narrow and material views, you who havedenied the virtue of transcendental medicine, you who have derided yoursuperiors—behold!”He put the glass to his lips and drank at one gulp. A cry followed; hereeled, staggered, clutched at the table and held on, staring withinjected eyes, gasping with open mouth; and as I looked there came, Ithought, a change—he seemed to swell—his face became suddenly black andthe features seemed to melt and alter—and the next moment, I had sprungto my feet and leaped back against the wall, my arms raised to shieldme from that prodigy, my mind submerged in terror.“O God!” I screamed, and “O God!” again and again; for there before myeyes—pale and shaken, and half fainting, and groping before him withhis hands, like a man restored from death—there stood Henry Jekyll!What he told me in the next hour, I cannot bring my mind to set onpaper. I saw what I saw, I heard what I heard, and my soul sickened atit; and yet now when that sight has faded from my eyes, I ask myself ifI believe it, and I cannot answer. My life is shaken to its roots;sleep has left me; the deadliest terror sits by me at all hours of theday and night; and I feel that my days are numbered, and that I mustdie; and yet I shall die incredulous. As for the moral turpitude thatman unveiled to me, even with tears of penitence, I cannot, even inmemory, dwell on it without a start of horror. I will say but onething, Utterson, and that (if you can bring your mind to credit it)will be more than enough. The creature who crept into my house thatnight was, on Jekyll’s own confession, known by the name of Hyde andhunted for in every corner of the land as the murderer of Carew.HASTIE LANYON.HENRY JEKYLL’S FULL STATEMENT OF THE CASEI was born in the year 18— to a large fortune, endowed besides withexcellent parts, inclined by nature to industry, fond of the respect ofthe wise and good among my fellowmen, and thus, as might have beensupposed, with every guarantee of an honourable and distinguishedfuture. And indeed the worst of my faults was a certain impatientgaiety of disposition, such as has made the happiness of many, but suchas I found it hard to reconcile with my imperious desire to carry myhead high, and wear a more than commonly grave countenance before thepublic. Hence it came about that I concealed my pleasures; and thatwhen I reached years of reflection, and began to look round me and takestock of my progress and position in the world, I stood alreadycommitted to a profound duplicity of life. Many a man would have evenblazoned such irregularities as I was guilty of; but from the highviews that I had set before me, I regarded and hid them with an almostmorbid sense of shame. It was thus rather the exacting nature of myaspirations than any particular degradation in my faults, that made mewhat I was, and, with even a deeper trench than in the majority of men,severed in me those provinces of good and ill which divide and compoundman’s dual nature. In this case, I was driven to reflect deeply andinveterately on that hard law of life, which lies at the root ofreligion and is one of the most plentiful springs of distress. Thoughso profound a double-dealer, I was in no sense a hypocrite; both sidesof me were in dead earnest; I was no more myself when I laid asiderestraint and plunged in shame, than when I laboured, in the eye ofday, at the furtherance of knowledge or the relief of sorrow andsuffering. And it chanced that the direction of my scientific studies,which led wholly towards the mystic and the transcendental, reacted andshed a strong light on this consciousness of the perennial war among mymembers. With every day, and from both sides of my intelligence, themoral and the intellectual, I thus drew steadily nearer to that truth,by whose partial discovery I have been doomed to such a dreadfulshipwreck: that man is not truly one, but truly two. I say two, becausethe state of my own knowledge does not pass beyond that point. Otherswill follow, others will outstrip me on the same lines; and I hazardthe guess that man will be ultimately known for a mere polity ofmultifarious, incongruous and independent denizens. I, for my part,from the nature of my life, advanced infallibly in one direction and inone direction only. It was on the moral side, and in my own person,that I learned to recognise the thorough and primitive duality of man;I saw that, of the two natures that contended in the field of myconsciousness, even if I could rightly be said to be either, it wasonly because I was radically both; and from an early date, even beforethe course of my scientific discoveries had begun to suggest the mostnaked possibility of such a miracle, I had learned to dwell withpleasure, as a beloved daydream, on the thought of the separation ofthese elements. If each, I told myself, could be housed in separateidentities, life would be relieved of all that was unbearable; theunjust might go his way, delivered from the aspirations and remorse ofhis more upright twin; and the just could walk steadfastly and securelyon his upward path, doing the good things in which he found hispleasure, and no longer exposed to disgrace and penitence by the handsof this extraneous evil. It was the curse of mankind that theseincongruous faggots were thus bound together—that in the agonised wombof consciousness, these polar twins should be continuously struggling.How, then were they dissociated?I was so far in my reflections when, as I have said, a side light beganto shine upon the subject from the laboratory table. I began toperceive more deeply than it has ever yet been stated, the tremblingimmateriality, the mistlike transience, of this seemingly so solid bodyin which we walk attired. Certain agents I found to have the power toshake and pluck back that fleshly vestment, even as a wind might tossthe curtains of a pavilion. For two good reasons, I will not enterdeeply into this scientific branch of my confession. First, because Ihave been made to learn that the doom and burthen of our life is boundfor ever on man’s shoulders, and when the attempt is made to cast itoff, it but returns upon us with more unfamiliar and more awfulpressure. Second, because, as my narrative will make, alas! tooevident, my discoveries were incomplete. Enough then, that I not onlyrecognised my natural body from the mere aura and effulgence of certainof the powers that made up my spirit, but managed to compound a drug bywhich these powers should be dethroned from their supremacy, and asecond form and countenance substituted, none the less natural to mebecause they were the expression, and bore the stamp of lower elementsin my soul.I hesitated long before I put this theory to the test of practice. Iknew well that I risked death; for any drug that so potently controlledand shook the very fortress of identity, might, by the least scruple ofan overdose or at the least inopportunity in the moment of exhibition,utterly blot out that immaterial tabernacle which I looked to it tochange. But the temptation of a discovery so singular and profound atlast overcame the suggestions of alarm. I had long since prepared mytincture; I purchased at once, from a firm of wholesale chemists, alarge quantity of a particular salt which I knew, from my experiments,to be the last ingredient required; and late one accursed night, Icompounded the elements, watched them boil and smoke together in theglass, and when the ebullition had subsided, with a strong glow ofcourage, drank off the potion.The most racking pangs succeeded: a grinding in the bones, deadlynausea, and a horror of the spirit that cannot be exceeded at the hourof birth or death. Then these agonies began swiftly to subside, and Icame to myself as if out of a great sickness. There was somethingstrange in my sensations, something indescribably new and, from itsvery novelty, incredibly sweet. I felt younger, lighter, happier inbody; within I was conscious of a heady recklessness, a current ofdisordered sensual images running like a millrace in my fancy, asolution of the bonds of obligation, an unknown but not an innocentfreedom of the soul. I knew myself, at the first breath of this newlife, to be more wicked, tenfold more wicked, sold a slave to myoriginal evil; and the thought, in that moment, braced and delighted melike wine. I stretched out my hands, exulting in the freshness of thesesensations; and in the act, I was suddenly aware that I had lost instature.There was no mirror, at that date, in my room; that which stands besideme as I write, was brought there later on and for the very purpose ofthese transformations. The night however, was far gone into themorning—the morning, black as it was, was nearly ripe for theconception of the day—the inmates of my house were locked in the mostrigorous hours of slumber; and I determined, flushed as I was with hopeand triumph, to venture in my new shape as far as to my bedroom. Icrossed the yard, wherein the constellations looked down upon me, Icould have thought, with wonder, the first creature of that sort thattheir unsleeping vigilance had yet disclosed to them; I stole throughthe corridors, a stranger in my own house; and coming to my room, I sawfor the first time the appearance of Edward Hyde.I must here speak by theory alone, saying not that which I know, butthat which I suppose to be most probable. The evil side of my nature,to which I had now transferred the stamping efficacy, was less robustand less developed than the good which I had just deposed. Again, inthe course of my life, which had been, after all, nine tenths a life ofeffort, virtue and control, it had been much less exercised and muchless exhausted. And hence, as I think, it came about that Edward Hydewas so much smaller, slighter and younger than Henry Jekyll. Even asgood shone upon the countenance of the one, evil was written broadlyand plainly on the face of the other. Evil besides (which I must stillbelieve to be the lethal side of man) had left on that body an imprintof deformity and decay. And yet when I looked upon that ugly idol inthe glass, I was conscious of no repugnance, rather of a leap ofwelcome. This, too, was myself. It seemed natural and human. In my eyesit bore a livelier image of the spirit, it seemed more express andsingle, than the imperfect and divided countenance I had been hithertoaccustomed to call mine. And in so far I was doubtless right. I haveobserved that when I wore the semblance of Edward Hyde, none could comenear to me at first without a visible misgiving of the flesh. This, asI take it, was because all human beings, as we meet them, arecommingled out of good and evil: and Edward Hyde, alone in the ranks ofmankind, was pure evil.I lingered but a moment at the mirror: the second and conclusiveexperiment had yet to be attempted; it yet remained to be seen if I hadlost my identity beyond redemption and must flee before daylight from ahouse that was no longer mine; and hurrying back to my cabinet, I oncemore prepared and drank the cup, once more suffered the pangs ofdissolution, and came to myself once more with the character, thestature and the face of Henry Jekyll.That night I had come to the fatal cross-roads. Had I approached mydiscovery in a more noble spirit, had I risked the experiment whileunder the empire of generous or pious aspirations, all must have beenotherwise, and from these agonies of death and birth, I had come forthan angel instead of a fiend. The drug had no discriminating action; itwas neither diabolical nor divine; it but shook the doors of theprisonhouse of my disposition; and like the captives of Philippi, thatwhich stood within ran forth. At that time my virtue slumbered; myevil, kept awake by ambition, was alert and swift to seize theoccasion; and the thing that was projected was Edward Hyde. Hence,although I had now two characters as well as two appearances, one waswholly evil, and the other was still the old Henry Jekyll, thatincongruous compound of whose reformation and improvement I had alreadylearned to despair. The movement was thus wholly toward the worse.Even at that time, I had not conquered my aversions to the dryness of alife of study. I would still be merrily disposed at times; and as mypleasures were (to say the least) undignified, and I was not only wellknown and highly considered, but growing towards the elderly man, thisincoherency of my life was daily growing more unwelcome. It was on thisside that my new power tempted me until I fell in slavery. I had but todrink the cup, to doff at once the body of the noted professor, and toassume, like a thick cloak, that of Edward Hyde. I smiled at thenotion; it seemed to me at the time to be humourous; and I made mypreparations with the most studious care. I took and furnished thathouse in Soho, to which Hyde was tracked by the police; and engaged asa housekeeper a creature whom I knew well to be silent andunscrupulous. On the other side, I announced to my servants that a Mr.Hyde (whom I described) was to have full liberty and power about myhouse in the square; and to parry mishaps, I even called and mademyself a familiar object, in my second character. I next drew up thatwill to which you so much objected; so that if anything befell me inthe person of Dr. Jekyll, I could enter on that of Edward Hyde withoutpecuniary loss. And thus fortified, as I supposed, on every side, Ibegan to profit by the strange immunities of my position.Men have before hired bravos to transact their crimes, while their ownperson and reputation sat under shelter. I was the first that ever didso for his pleasures. I was the first that could plod in the public eyewith a load of genial respectability, and in a moment, like aschoolboy, strip off these lendings and spring headlong into the sea ofliberty. But for me, in my impenetrable mantle, the safety wascomplete. Think of it—I did not even exist! Let me but escape into mylaboratory door, give me but a second or two to mix and swallow thedraught that I had always standing ready; and whatever he had done,Edward Hyde would pass away like the stain of breath upon a mirror; andthere in his stead, quietly at home, trimming the midnight lamp in hisstudy, a man who could afford to laugh at suspicion, would be HenryJekyll.The pleasures which I made haste to seek in my disguise were, as I havesaid, undignified; I would scarce use a harder term. But in the handsof Edward Hyde, they soon began to turn toward the monstrous. When Iwould come back from these excursions, I was often plunged into a kindof wonder at my vicarious depravity. This familiar that I called out ofmy own soul, and sent forth alone to do his good pleasure, was a beinginherently malign and villainous; his every act and thought centered onself; drinking pleasure with bestial avidity from any degree of tortureto another; relentless like a man of stone. Henry Jekyll stood at timesaghast before the acts of Edward Hyde; but the situation was apart fromordinary laws, and insidiously relaxed the grasp of conscience. It wasHyde, after all, and Hyde alone, that was guilty. Jekyll was no worse;he woke again to his good qualities seemingly unimpaired; he would evenmake haste, where it was possible, to undo the evil done by Hyde. Andthus his conscience slumbered.Into the details of the infamy at which I thus connived (for even now Ican scarce grant that I committed it) I have no design of entering; Imean but to point out the warnings and the successive steps with whichmy chastisement approached. I met with one accident which, as itbrought on no consequence, I shall no more than mention. An act ofcruelty to a child aroused against me the anger of a passer-by, whom Irecognised the other day in the person of your kinsman; the doctor andthe child’s family joined him; there were moments when I feared for mylife; and at last, in order to pacify their too just resentment, EdwardHyde had to bring them to the door, and pay them in a cheque drawn inthe name of Henry Jekyll. But this danger was easily eliminated fromthe future, by opening an account at another bank in the name of EdwardHyde himself; and when, by sloping my own hand backward, I had suppliedmy double with a signature, I thought I sat beyond the reach of fate.Some two months before the murder of Sir Danvers, I had been out forone of my adventures, had returned at a late hour, and woke the nextday in bed with somewhat odd sensations. It was in vain I looked aboutme; in vain I saw the decent furniture and tall proportions of my roomin the square; in vain that I recognised the pattern of the bedcurtains and the design of the mahogany frame; something still keptinsisting that I was not where I was, that I had not wakened where Iseemed to be, but in the little room in Soho where I was accustomed tosleep in the body of Edward Hyde. I smiled to myself, and in mypsychological way, began lazily to inquire into the elements of thisillusion, occasionally, even as I did so, dropping back into acomfortable morning doze. I was still so engaged when, in one of mymore wakeful moments, my eyes fell upon my hand. Now the hand of HenryJekyll (as you have often remarked) was professional in shape and size;it was large, firm, white and comely. But the hand which I now saw,clearly enough, in the yellow light of a mid-London morning, lying halfshut on the bedclothes, was lean, corded, knuckly, of a dusky pallorand thickly shaded with a swart growth of hair. It was the hand ofEdward Hyde.I must have stared upon it for near half a minute, sunk as I was in themere stupidity of wonder, before terror woke up in my breast as suddenand startling as the crash of cymbals; and bounding from my bed Irushed to the mirror. At the sight that met my eyes, my blood waschanged into something exquisitely thin and icy. Yes, I had gone to bedHenry Jekyll, I had awakened Edward Hyde. How was this to be explained?I asked myself; and then, with another bound of terror—how was it to beremedied? It was well on in the morning; the servants were up; all mydrugs were in the cabinet—a long journey down two pairs of stairs,through the back passage, across the open court and through theanatomical theatre, from where I was then standing horror-struck. Itmight indeed be possible to cover my face; but of what use was that,when I was unable to conceal the alteration in my stature? And thenwith an overpowering sweetness of relief, it came back upon my mindthat the servants were already used to the coming and going of mysecond self. I had soon dressed, as well as I was able, in clothes ofmy own size: had soon passed through the house, where Bradshaw staredand drew back at seeing Mr. Hyde at such an hour and in such a strangearray; and ten minutes later, Dr. Jekyll had returned to his own shapeand was sitting down, with a darkened brow, to make a feint ofbreakfasting.Small indeed was my appetite. This inexplicable incident, this reversalof my previous experience, seemed, like the Babylonian finger on thewall, to be spelling out the letters of my judgment; and I began toreflect more seriously than ever before on the issues and possibilitiesof my double existence. That part of me which I had the power ofprojecting, had lately been much exercised and nourished; it had seemedto me of late as though the body of Edward Hyde had grown in stature,as though (when I wore that form) I were conscious of a more generoustide of blood; and I began to spy a danger that, if this were muchprolonged, the balance of my nature might be permanently overthrown,the power of voluntary change be forfeited, and the character of EdwardHyde become irrevocably mine. The power of the drug had not been alwaysequally displayed. Once, very early in my career, it had totally failedme; since then I had been obliged on more than one occasion to double,and once, with infinite risk of death, to treble the amount; and theserare uncertainties had cast hitherto the sole shadow on my contentment.Now, however, and in the light of that morning’s accident, I was led toremark that whereas, in the beginning, the difficulty had been to throwoff the body of Jekyll, it had of late gradually but decidedlytransferred itself to the other side. All things therefore seemed topoint to this; that I was slowly losing hold of my original and betterself, and becoming slowly incorporated with my second and worse.Between these two, I now felt I had to choose. My two natures hadmemory in common, but all other faculties were most unequally sharedbetween them. Jekyll (who was composite) now with the most sensitiveapprehensions, now with a greedy gusto, projected and shared in thepleasures and adventures of Hyde; but Hyde was indifferent to Jekyll,or but remembered him as the mountain bandit remembers the cavern inwhich he conceals himself from pursuit. Jekyll had more than a father’sinterest; Hyde had more than a son’s indifference. To cast in my lotwith Jekyll, was to die to those appetites which I had long secretlyindulged and had of late begun to pamper. To cast it in with Hyde, wasto die to a thousand interests and aspirations, and to become, at ablow and forever, despised and friendless. The bargain might appearunequal; but there was still another consideration in the scales; forwhile Jekyll would suffer smartingly in the fires of abstinence, Hydewould be not even conscious of all that he had lost. Strange as mycircumstances were, the terms of this debate are as old and commonplaceas man; much the same inducements and alarms cast the die for anytempted and trembling sinner; and it fell out with me, as it falls withso vast a majority of my fellows, that I chose the better part and wasfound wanting in the strength to keep to it.Yes, I preferred the elderly and discontented doctor, surrounded byfriends and cherishing honest hopes; and bade a resolute farewell tothe liberty, the comparative youth, the light step, leaping impulsesand secret pleasures, that I had enjoyed in the disguise of Hyde. Imade this choice perhaps with some unconscious reservation, for Ineither gave up the house in Soho, nor destroyed the clothes of EdwardHyde, which still lay ready in my cabinet. For two months, however, Iwas true to my determination; for two months, I led a life of suchseverity as I had never before attained to, and enjoyed thecompensations of an approving conscience. But time began at last toobliterate the freshness of my alarm; the praises of conscience beganto grow into a thing of course; I began to be tortured with throes andlongings, as of Hyde struggling after freedom; and at last, in an hourof moral weakness, I once again compounded and swallowed thetransforming draught.I do not suppose that, when a drunkard reasons with himself upon hisvice, he is once out of five hundred times affected by the dangers thathe runs through his brutish, physical insensibility; neither had I,long as I had considered my position, made enough allowance for thecomplete moral insensibility and insensate readiness to evil, whichwere the leading characters of Edward Hyde. Yet it was by these that Iwas punished. My devil had been long caged, he came out roaring. I wasconscious, even when I took the draught, of a more unbridled, a morefurious propensity to ill. It must have been this, I suppose, thatstirred in my soul that tempest of impatience with which I listened tothe civilities of my unhappy victim; I declare, at least, before God,no man morally sane could have been guilty of that crime upon sopitiful a provocation; and that I struck in no more reasonable spiritthan that in which a sick child may break a plaything. But I hadvoluntarily stripped myself of all those balancing instincts by whicheven the worst of us continues to walk with some degree of steadinessamong temptations; and in my case, to be tempted, however slightly, wasto fall.Instantly the spirit of hell awoke in me and raged. With a transport ofglee, I mauled the unresisting body, tasting delight from every blow;and it was not till weariness had begun to succeed, that I wassuddenly, in the top fit of my delirium, struck through the heart by acold thrill of terror. A mist dispersed; I saw my life to be forfeit;and fled from the scene of these excesses, at once glorying andtrembling, my lust of evil gratified and stimulated, my love of lifescrewed to the topmost peg. I ran to the house in Soho, and (to makeassurance doubly sure) destroyed my papers; thence I set out throughthe lamplit streets, in the same divided ecstasy of mind, gloating onmy crime, light-headedly devising others in the future, and yet stillhastening and still hearkening in my wake for the steps of the avenger.Hyde had a song upon his lips as he compounded the draught, and as hedrank it, pledged the dead man. The pangs of transformation had notdone tearing him, before Henry Jekyll, with streaming tears ofgratitude and remorse, had fallen upon his knees and lifted his claspedhands to God. The veil of self-indulgence was rent from head to foot. Isaw my life as a whole: I followed it up from the days of childhood,when I had walked with my father’s hand, and through the self-denyingtoils of my professional life, to arrive again and again, with the samesense of unreality, at the damned horrors of the evening. I could havescreamed aloud; I sought with tears and prayers to smother down thecrowd of hideous images and sounds with which my memory swarmed againstme; and still, between the petitions, the ugly face of my iniquitystared into my soul. As the acuteness of this remorse began to dieaway, it was succeeded by a sense of joy. The problem of my conduct wassolved. Hyde was thenceforth impossible; whether I would or not, I wasnow confined to the better part of my existence; and O, how I rejoicedto think of it! with what willing humility I embraced anew therestrictions of natural life! with what sincere renunciation I lockedthe door by which I had so often gone and come, and ground the keyunder my heel!The next day, came the news that the murder had not been overlooked,that the guilt of Hyde was patent to the world, and that the victim wasa man high in public estimation. It was not only a crime, it had been atragic folly. I think I was glad to know it; I think I was glad to havemy better impulses thus buttressed and guarded by the terrors of thescaffold. Jekyll was now my city of refuge; let but Hyde peep out aninstant, and the hands of all men would be raised to take and slay him.I resolved in my future conduct to redeem the past; and I can say withhonesty that my resolve was fruitful of some good. You know yourselfhow earnestly, in the last months of the last year, I laboured torelieve suffering; you know that much was done for others, and that thedays passed quietly, almost happily for myself. Nor can I truly saythat I wearied of this beneficent and innocent life; I think insteadthat I daily enjoyed it more completely; but I was still cursed with myduality of purpose; and as the first edge of my penitence wore off, thelower side of me, so long indulged, so recently chained down, began togrowl for licence. Not that I dreamed of resuscitating Hyde; the bareidea of that would startle me to frenzy: no, it was in my own personthat I was once more tempted to trifle with my conscience; and it wasas an ordinary secret sinner that I at last fell before the assaults oftemptation.There comes an end to all things; the most capacious measure is filledat last; and this brief condescension to my evil finally destroyed thebalance of my soul. And yet I was not alarmed; the fall seemed natural,like a return to the old days before I had made my discovery. It was afine, clear, January day, wet under foot where the frost had melted,but cloudless overhead; and the Regent’s Park was full of winterchirrupings and sweet with spring odours. I sat in the sun on a bench;the animal within me licking the chops of memory; the spiritual side alittle drowsed, promising subsequent penitence, but not yet moved tobegin. After all, I reflected, I was like my neighbours; and then Ismiled, comparing myself with other men, comparing my active good-willwith the lazy cruelty of their neglect. And at the very moment of thatvainglorious thought, a qualm came over me, a horrid nausea and themost deadly shuddering. These passed away, and left me faint; and thenas in its turn faintness subsided, I began to be aware of a change inthe temper of my thoughts, a greater boldness, a contempt of danger, asolution of the bonds of obligation. I looked down; my clothes hungformlessly on my shrunken limbs; the hand that lay on my knee wascorded and hairy. I was once more Edward Hyde. A moment before I hadbeen safe of all men’s respect, wealthy, beloved—the cloth laying forme in the dining-room at home; and now I was the common quarry ofmankind, hunted, houseless, a known murderer, thrall to the gallows.My reason wavered, but it did not fail me utterly. I have more thanonce observed that in my second character, my faculties seemedsharpened to a point and my spirits more tensely elastic; thus it cameabout that, where Jekyll perhaps might have succumbed, Hyde rose to theimportance of the moment. My drugs were in one of the presses of mycabinet; how was I to reach them? That was the problem that (crushingmy temples in my hands) I set myself to solve. The laboratory door Ihad closed. If I sought to enter by the house, my own servants wouldconsign me to the gallows. I saw I must employ another hand, andthought of Lanyon. How was he to be reached? how persuaded? Supposingthat I escaped capture in the streets, how was I to make my way intohis presence? and how should I, an unknown and displeasing visitor,prevail on the famous physician to rifle the study of his colleague,Dr. Jekyll? Then I remembered that of my original character, one partremained to me: I could write my own hand; and once I had conceivedthat kindling spark, the way that I must follow became lighted up fromend to end.Thereupon, I arranged my clothes as best I could, and summoning apassing hansom, drove to an hotel in Portland Street, the name of whichI chanced to remember. At my appearance (which was indeed comicalenough, however tragic a fate these garments covered) the driver couldnot conceal his mirth. I gnashed my teeth upon him with a gust ofdevilish fury; and the smile withered from his face—happily for him—yetmore happily for myself, for in another instant I had certainly draggedhim from his perch. At the inn, as I entered, I looked about me with soblack a countenance as made the attendants tremble; not a look did theyexchange in my presence; but obsequiously took my orders, led me to aprivate room, and brought me wherewithal to write. Hyde in danger ofhis life was a creature new to me; shaken with inordinate anger, strungto the pitch of murder, lusting to inflict pain. Yet the creature wasastute; mastered his fury with a great effort of the will; composed histwo important letters, one to Lanyon and one to Poole; and that hemight receive actual evidence of their being posted, sent them out withdirections that they should be registered. Thenceforward, he sat allday over the fire in the private room, gnawing his nails; there hedined, sitting alone with his fears, the waiter visibly quailing beforehis eye; and thence, when the night was fully come, he set forth in thecorner of a closed cab, and was driven to and fro about the streets ofthe city. He, I say—I cannot say, I. That child of Hell had nothinghuman; nothing lived in him but fear and hatred. And when at last,thinking the driver had begun to grow suspicious, he discharged the caband ventured on foot, attired in his misfitting clothes, an objectmarked out for observation, into the midst of the nocturnal passengers,these two base passions raged within him like a tempest. He walkedfast, hunted by his fears, chattering to himself, skulking through theless frequented thoroughfares, counting the minutes that still dividedhim from midnight. Once a woman spoke to him, offering, I think, a boxof lights. He smote her in the face, and she fled.When I came to myself at Lanyon’s, the horror of my old friend perhapsaffected me somewhat: I do not know; it was at least but a drop in thesea to the abhorrence with which I looked back upon these hours. Achange had come over me. It was no longer the fear of the gallows, itwas the horror of being Hyde that racked me. I received Lanyon’scondemnation partly in a dream; it was partly in a dream that I camehome to my own house and got into bed. I slept after the prostration ofthe day, with a stringent and profound slumber which not even thenightmares that wrung me could avail to break. I awoke in the morningshaken, weakened, but refreshed. I still hated and feared the thoughtof the brute that slept within me, and I had not of course forgottenthe appalling dangers of the day before; but I was once more at home,in my own house and close to my drugs; and gratitude for my escapeshone so strong in my soul that it almost rivalled the brightness ofhope.I was stepping leisurely across the court after breakfast, drinking thechill of the air with pleasure, when I was seized again with thoseindescribable sensations that heralded the change; and I had but thetime to gain the shelter of my cabinet, before I was once again ragingand freezing with the passions of Hyde. It took on this occasion adouble dose to recall me to myself; and alas! six hours after, as I satlooking sadly in the fire, the pangs returned, and the drug had to bere-administered. In short, from that day forth it seemed only by agreat effort as of gymnastics, and only under the immediate stimulationof the drug, that I was able to wear the countenance of Jekyll. At allhours of the day and night, I would be taken with the premonitoryshudder; above all, if I slept, or even dozed for a moment in my chair,it was always as Hyde that I awakened. Under the strain of thiscontinually impending doom and by the sleeplessness to which I nowcondemned myself, ay, even beyond what I had thought possible to man, Ibecame, in my own person, a creature eaten up and emptied by fever,languidly weak both in body and mind, and solely occupied by onethought: the horror of my other self. But when I slept, or when thevirtue of the medicine wore off, I would leap almost without transition(for the pangs of transformation grew daily less marked) into thepossession of a fancy brimming with images of terror, a soul boilingwith causeless hatreds, and a body that seemed not strong enough tocontain the raging energies of life. The powers of Hyde seemed to havegrown with the sickliness of Jekyll. And certainly the hate that nowdivided them was equal on each side. With Jekyll, it was a thing ofvital instinct. He had now seen the full deformity of that creaturethat shared with him some of the phenomena of consciousness, and wasco-heir with him to death: and beyond these links of community, whichin themselves made the most poignant part of his distress, he thoughtof Hyde, for all his energy of life, as of something not only hellishbut inorganic. This was the shocking thing; that the slime of the pitseemed to utter cries and voices; that the amorphous dust gesticulatedand sinned; that what was dead, and had no shape, should usurp theoffices of life. And this again, that that insurgent horror was knit tohim closer than a wife, closer than an eye; lay caged in his flesh,where he heard it mutter and felt it struggle to be born; and at everyhour of weakness, and in the confidence of slumber, prevailed againsthim, and deposed him out of life. The hatred of Hyde for Jekyll was ofa different order. His terror of the gallows drove him continually tocommit temporary suicide, and return to his subordinate station of apart instead of a person; but he loathed the necessity, he loathed thedespondency into which Jekyll was now fallen, and he resented thedislike with which he was himself regarded. Hence the ape-like tricksthat he would play me, scrawling in my own hand blasphemies on thepages of my books, burning the letters and destroying the portrait ofmy father; and indeed, had it not been for his fear of death, he wouldlong ago have ruined himself in order to involve me in the ruin. Buthis love of life is wonderful; I go further: I, who sicken and freeze atthe mere thought of him, when I recall the abjection and passion ofthis attachment, and when I know how he fears my power to cut him offby suicide, I find it in my heart to pity him.It is useless, and the time awfully fails me, to prolong thisdescription; no one has ever suffered such torments, let that suffice;and yet even to these, habit brought—no, not alleviation—but a certaincallousness of soul, a certain acquiescence of despair; and mypunishment might have gone on for years, but for the last calamitywhich has now fallen, and which has finally severed me from my own faceand nature. My provision of the salt, which had never been renewedsince the date of the first experiment, began to run low. I sent outfor a fresh supply and mixed the draught; the ebullition followed, andthe first change of colour, not the second; I drank it and it waswithout efficiency. You will learn from Poole how I have had Londonransacked; it was in vain; and I am now persuaded that my first supplywas impure, and that it was that unknown impurity which lent efficacyto the draught.About a week has passed, and I am now finishing this statement underthe influence of the last of the old powders. This, then, is the lasttime, short of a miracle, that Henry Jekyll can think his own thoughtsor see his own face (now how sadly altered!) in the glass. Nor must Idelay too long to bring my writing to an end; for if my narrative hashitherto escaped destruction, it has been by a combination of greatprudence and great good luck. Should the throes of change take me inthe act of writing it, Hyde will tear it in pieces; but if some timeshall have elapsed after I have laid it by, his wonderful selfishnessand circumscription to the moment will probably save it once again fromthe action of his ape-like spite. And indeed the doom that is closingon us both has already changed and crushed him. Half an hour from now,when I shall again and forever reindue that hated personality, I knowhow I shall sit shuddering and weeping in my chair, or continue, withthe most strained and fearstruck ecstasy of listening, to pace up anddown this room (my last earthly refuge) and give ear to every sound ofmenace. Will Hyde die upon the scaffold? or will he find courage torelease himself at the last moment? God knows; I am careless; this ismy true hour of death, and what is to follow concerns another thanmyself. Here then, as I lay down the pen and proceed to seal up myconfession, I bring the life of that unhappy Henry Jekyll to an end.

+Chapter 9
+
+Nothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings have
+
+been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of
+
+inaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope
+
+and fear. Justine died, she rested, and I was alive. The blood flowed
+
+freely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my
+
+heart which nothing could remove. Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered
+
+like an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond
+
+description horrible, and more, much more (I persuaded myself) was yet
+
+behind. Yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue.
+
+I had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment
+
+when I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow
+
+beings. Now all was blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience
+
+which allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and
+
+from thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and
+
+the sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures
+
+such as no language can describe.
+
+This state of mind preyed upon my health, which had perhaps never
+
+entirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained. I shunned
+
+the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me;
+
+solitude was my only consolation�deep, dark, deathlike solitude.
+
+My father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition
+
+and habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his
+
+serene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and
+
+awaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me.
+
+�Do you think, Victor,� said he, �that I do not suffer
+
+also? No one could love a child more than I loved your
+
+brother��tears came into his eyes as he spoke��but
+
+is it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting
+
+their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief? It is also a duty
+
+owed to yourself, for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment,
+
+or even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for
+
+society.�
+
+This advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I
+
+should have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if
+
+remorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with my
+
+other sensations. Now I could only answer my father with a look of
+
+despair and endeavour to hide myself from his view.
+
+About this time we retired to our house at Belrive. This change was
+
+particularly agreeable to me. The shutting of the gates regularly at
+
+ten o�clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that
+
+hour had rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome
+
+to me. I was now free. Often, after the rest of the family had
+
+retired for the night, I took the boat and passed many hours upon the
+
+water. Sometimes, with my sails set, I was carried by the wind; and
+
+sometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, I left the boat to
+
+pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections. I
+
+was often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the only
+
+unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and
+
+heavenly�if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and
+
+interrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shore�often,
+
+I say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters
+
+might close over me and my calamities for ever. But I was restrained,
+
+when I thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly
+
+loved, and whose existence was bound up in mine. I thought also of my
+
+father and surviving brother; should I by my base desertion leave them
+
+exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose
+
+among them?
+
+At these moments I wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my
+
+mind only that I might afford them consolation and happiness. But that
+
+could not be. Remorse extinguished every hope. I had been the author of
+
+unalterable evils, and I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I had
+
+created should perpetrate some new wickedness. I had an obscure feeling
+
+that all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime,
+
+which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past.
+
+There was always scope for fear so long as anything I loved remained
+
+behind. My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived. When I thought of
+
+him I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently wished to
+
+extinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed. When I
+
+reflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds
+
+of moderation. I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the
+
+Andes, could I, when there, have precipitated him to their base. I wished
+
+to see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his
+
+head and avenge the deaths of William and Justine.
+
+Our house was the house of mourning. My father�s health was deeply
+
+shaken by the horror of the recent events. Elizabeth was sad and
+
+desponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all
+
+pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she
+
+then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted
+
+and destroyed. She was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth
+
+wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our
+
+future prospects. The first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from
+
+the earth had visited her, and its dimming influence quenched her dearest
+
+smiles.
+
+�When I reflect, my dear cousin,� said she, �on the miserable death of
+
+Justine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works as they before
+
+appeared to me. Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and
+
+injustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient
+
+days or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar to
+
+reason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men
+
+appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other�s blood. Yet I am
+
+certainly unjust. Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty; and
+
+if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly
+
+she would have been the most depraved of human creatures. For the sake
+
+of a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend,
+
+a child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if
+
+it had been her own! I could not consent to the death of any human
+
+being, but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to
+
+remain in the society of men. But she was innocent. I know, I feel
+
+she was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me.
+
+Alas! Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can
+
+assure themselves of certain happiness? I feel as if I were walking on
+
+the edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding and
+
+endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss. William and Justine were
+
+assassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free,
+
+and perhaps respected. But even if I were condemned to suffer on the
+
+scaffold for the same crimes, I would not change places with such a
+
+wretch.�
+
+I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony. I, not in deed,
+
+but in effect, was the true murderer. Elizabeth read my anguish in my
+
+countenance, and kindly taking my hand, said, �My dearest friend, you
+
+must calm yourself. These events have affected me, God knows how
+
+deeply; but I am not so wretched as you are. There is an expression of
+
+despair, and sometimes of revenge, in your countenance that makes me
+
+tremble. Dear Victor, banish these dark passions. Remember the
+
+friends around you, who centre all their hopes in you. Have we lost
+
+the power of rendering you happy? Ah! While we love, while we are
+
+true to each other, here in this land of peace and beauty, your native
+
+country, we may reap every tranquil blessing�what can disturb our
+
+peace?�
+
+And could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before every
+
+other gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my
+
+heart? Even as she spoke I drew near to her, as if in terror, lest at
+
+that very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her.
+
+Thus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of
+
+heaven, could redeem my soul from woe; the very accents of love were
+
+ineffectual. I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial
+
+influence could penetrate. The wounded deer dragging its fainting
+
+limbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which had
+
+pierced it, and to die, was but a type of me.
+
+Sometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me, but
+
+sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodily
+
+exercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable
+
+sensations. It was during an access of this kind that I suddenly left
+
+my home, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys, sought
+
+in the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and
+
+my ephemeral, because human, sorrows. My wanderings were directed
+
+towards the valley of Chamounix. I had visited it frequently during my
+
+boyhood. Six years had passed since then: _I_ was a wreck, but nought
+
+had changed in those savage and enduring scenes.
+
+I performed the first part of my journey on horseback. I afterwards
+
+hired a mule, as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive
+
+injury on these rugged roads. The weather was fine; it was about the
+
+middle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of
+
+Justine, that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe. The
+
+weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in
+
+the ravine of Arve. The immense mountains and precipices that overhung
+
+me on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and
+
+the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as
+
+Omnipotence�and I ceased to fear or to bend before any being less
+
+almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, here
+
+displayed in their most terrific guise. Still, as I ascended higher,
+
+the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character.
+
+Ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains, the
+
+impetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from
+
+among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty. But it was
+
+augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and
+
+shining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another
+
+earth, the habitations of another race of beings.
+
+I passed the bridge of P�lissier, where the ravine, which the river
+
+forms, opened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain that
+
+overhangs it. Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix. This
+
+valley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful and
+
+picturesque as that of Servox, through which I had just passed. The
+
+high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but I saw no
+
+more ruined castles and fertile fields. Immense glaciers approached
+
+the road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and
+
+marked the smoke of its passage. Mont Blanc, the supreme and
+
+magnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the surrounding _aiguilles_,
+
+and its tremendous _d�me_ overlooked the valley.
+
+A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this
+
+journey. Some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and
+
+recognised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the
+
+lighthearted gaiety of boyhood. The very winds whispered in soothing
+
+accents, and maternal Nature bade me weep no more. Then again the
+
+kindly influence ceased to act�I found myself fettered again to grief
+
+and indulging in all the misery of reflection. Then I spurred on my
+
+animal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all,
+
+myself�or, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted and threw myself on
+
+the grass, weighed down by horror and despair.
+
+At length I arrived at the village of Chamounix. Exhaustion succeeded
+
+to the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which I had endured.
+
+For a short space of time I remained at the window watching the pallid
+
+lightnings that played above Mont Blanc and listening to the rushing of
+
+the Arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath. The same lulling sounds
+
+acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; when I placed my head
+
+upon my pillow, sleep crept over me; I felt it as it came and blessed
+
+the giver of oblivion.

+Letter 3
+
+_To Mrs. Saville, England._
+
+July 7th, 17�.
+
+My dear Sister,
+
+I write a few lines in haste to say that I am safe�and well advanced
+
+on my voyage. This letter will reach England by a merchantman now on
+
+its homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not
+
+see my native land, perhaps, for many years. I am, however, in good
+
+spirits: my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose, nor do the
+
+floating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers
+
+of the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them. We

+have already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of
+
+summer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales,
+
+which blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire
+
+to attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not
+
+expected.
+
+No incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a
+
+letter. One or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are
+
+accidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record, and
+
+I shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage.
+
+Adieu, my dear Margaret. Be assured that for my own sake, as well as
+
+yours, I will not rashly encounter danger. I will be cool,
+
+persevering, and prudent.
+
+But success _shall_ crown my endeavours. Wherefore not? Thus far I
+
+have gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas, the very stars
+
+themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph. Why not
+
+still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element? What can stop the
+
+determined heart and resolved will of man?
+
+My swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus. But I must
+
+finish. Heaven bless my beloved sister!
+

+Chapter 12
+
+�I lay on my straw, but I could not sleep. I thought of the
+
+occurrences of the day. What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners
+
+of these people, and I longed to join them, but dared not. I
+
+remembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from
+
+the barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I
+
+might hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present I would
+
+remain quietly in my hovel, watching and endeavouring to discover the
+
+motives which influenced their actions.
+
+�The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun. The young woman
+
+arranged the cottage and prepared the food, and the youth departed
+
+after the first meal.
+
+�This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it.
+
+The young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in
+
+various laborious occupations within. The old man, whom I soon
+
+perceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument or
+
+in contemplation. Nothing could exceed the love and respect which the
+
+younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion. They
+
+performed towards him every little office of affection and duty with
+
+gentleness, and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles.
+
+�They were not entirely happy. The young man and his companion often
+
+went apart and appeared to weep. I saw no cause for their unhappiness,
+
+but I was deeply affected by it. If such lovely creatures were
+
+miserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being,
+
+should be wretched. Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy? They
+
+possessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every
+
+luxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands
+
+when hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more,
+
+they enjoyed one another�s company and speech, interchanging each day
+
+looks of affection and kindness. What did their tears imply? Did they
+
+really express pain? I was at first unable to solve these questions,
+
+but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which
+
+were at first enigmatic.
+
+�A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of
+
+the uneasiness of this amiable family: it was poverty, and they
+
+suffered that evil in a very distressing degree. Their nourishment
+
+consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of
+
+one cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masters
+
+could scarcely procure food to support it. They often, I believe,
+
+suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two
+
+younger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old
+
+man when they reserved none for themselves.
+
+�This trait of kindness moved me sensibly. I had been accustomed,
+
+during the night, to steal a part of their store for my own
+
+consumption, but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on
+
+the cottagers, I abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and
+
+roots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood.
+
+�I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist
+
+their labours. I found that the youth spent a great part of each day
+
+in collecting wood for the family fire, and during the night I often
+
+took his tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home
+
+firing sufficient for the consumption of several days.
+
+�I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she
+
+opened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great
+
+pile of wood on the outside. She uttered some words in a loud voice, and the
+
+youth joined her, who also expressed surprise. I observed, with pleasure,
+
+that he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing the
+
+cottage and cultivating the garden.
+
+�By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment. I found that
+
+these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and
+
+feelings to one another by articulate sounds. I perceived that the words
+
+they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the
+
+minds and countenances of the hearers. This was indeed a godlike science,
+
+and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it. But I was baffled in
+
+every attempt I made for this purpose. Their pronunciation was quick, and
+
+the words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible
+
+objects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the
+
+mystery of their reference. By great application, however, and after having
+
+remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I
+
+discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of
+
+discourse; I learned and applied the words, _fire, milk, bread,_ and
+
+_wood._ I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves. The youth
+
+and his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only
+
+one, which was _father._ The girl was called _sister_ or
+
+_Agatha,_ and the youth _Felix, brother,_ or _son_. I cannot
+
+describe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of
+
+these sounds and was able to pronounce them. I distinguished several other
+
+words without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as _good,
+
+dearest, unhappy._
+
+�I spent the winter in this manner. The gentle manners and beauty of
+
+the cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, I
+
+felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathised in their joys. I saw
+
+few human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the
+
+cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the
+
+superior accomplishments of my friends. The old man, I could perceive,
+
+often endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found that
+
+he called them, to cast off their melancholy. He would talk in a
+
+cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure
+
+even upon me. Agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled
+
+with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I
+
+generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after
+
+having listened to the exhortations of her father. It was not thus
+
+with Felix. He was always the saddest of the group, and even to my
+
+unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his
+
+friends. But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more
+
+cheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old
+
+man.
+
+�I could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, marked
+
+the dispositions of these amiable cottagers. In the midst of poverty
+
+and want, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little
+
+white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground. Early in
+
+the morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that
+
+obstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and
+
+brought the wood from the outhouse, where, to his perpetual
+
+astonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible
+
+hand. In the day, I believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring
+
+farmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner,
+
+yet brought no wood with him. At other times he worked in the garden,
+
+but as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old
+
+man and Agatha.
+
+�This reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees I
+
+discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when
+
+he talked. I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs
+
+for speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend
+
+these also; but how was that possible when I did not even understand
+
+the sounds for which they stood as signs? I improved, however,
+
+sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of
+
+conversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour, for I
+
+easily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to
+
+the cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first become
+
+master of their language, which knowledge might enable me to make them
+
+overlook the deformity of my figure, for with this also the contrast
+
+perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.
+
+�I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers�their grace, beauty,
+
+and delicate complexions; but how was I terrified when I viewed myself
+
+in a transparent pool! At first I started back, unable to believe that
+
+it was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became
+
+fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was
+
+filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification.
+
+Alas! I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable
+
+deformity.
+
+�As the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snow
+
+vanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth. From this
+
+time Felix was more employed, and the heart-moving indications of
+
+impending famine disappeared. Their food, as I afterwards found, was
+
+coarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it.
+
+Several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which they
+
+dressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season
+
+advanced.
+
+�The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did
+
+not rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its
+
+waters. This frequently took place, but a high wind quickly dried the
+
+earth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been.
+
+�My mode of life in my hovel was uniform. During the morning I
+
+attended the motions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed in
+
+various occupations, I slept; the remainder of the day was spent in
+
+observing my friends. When they had retired to rest, if there was any
+
+moon or the night was star-light, I went into the woods and collected
+
+my own food and fuel for the cottage. When I returned, as often as it
+
+was necessary, I cleared their path from the snow and performed those
+
+offices that I had seen done by Felix. I afterwards found that these
+
+labours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and
+
+once or twice I heard them, on these occasions, utter the words _good
+
+spirit, wonderful_; but I did not then understand the signification
+
+of these terms.
+
+�My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the
+
+motives and feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to
+
+know why Felix appeared so miserable and Agatha so sad. I thought
+
+(foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to restore happiness to
+
+these deserving people. When I slept or was absent, the forms of the
+
+venerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix
+
+flitted before me. I looked upon them as superior beings who would be
+
+the arbiters of my future destiny. I formed in my imagination a
+
+thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of
+
+me. I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle
+
+demeanour and conciliating words, I should first win their favour and
+
+afterwards their love.
+
+�These thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to
+
+the acquiring the art of language. My organs were indeed harsh, but
+
+supple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their
+
+tones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease.
+
+It was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose
+
+intentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved
+
+better treatment than blows and execration.
+
+�The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the
+
+aspect of the earth. Men who before this change seemed to have been
+
+hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of
+
+cultivation. The birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves
+
+began to bud forth on the trees. Happy, happy earth! Fit habitation
+
+for gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and
+
+unwholesome. My spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of
+
+nature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil,
+
+and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy.�

+Chapter 22
+
+The voyage came to an end. We landed, and proceeded to Paris. I soon
+
+found that I had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose before I
+
+could continue my journey. My father�s care and attentions were
+
+indefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and
+
+sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill. He wished me to
+
+seek amusement in society. I abhorred the face of man. Oh, not
+
+abhorred! They were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt
+
+attracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an
+
+angelic nature and celestial mechanism. But I felt that I had no right
+
+to share their intercourse. I had unchained an enemy among them whose
+
+joy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans. How they
+
+would, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world, did they know
+
+my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me!
+
+My father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by
+
+various arguments to banish my despair. Sometimes he thought that I
+
+felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of
+
+murder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.
+
+�Alas! My father,� said I, �how little do you know me. 
+
+Human beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if such
+
+a wretch as I felt pride. Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent
+
+as I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause
+
+of this�I murdered her. William, Justine, and Henry�they all
+
+died by my hands.�
+
+My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same
+
+assertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an
+
+explanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of
+
+delirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presented
+
+itself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved in my
+
+convalescence. I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence
+
+concerning the wretch I had created. I had a persuasion that I should be
+
+supposed mad, and this in itself would for ever have chained my tongue. But,
+
+besides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my
+
+hearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of
+
+his breast. I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy and was
+
+silent when I would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret.
+
+Yet, still, words like those I have recorded would burst uncontrollably
+
+from me. I could offer no explanation of them, but their truth in part
+
+relieved the burden of my mysterious woe.
+
+Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder,
+
+�My dearest Victor, what infatuation is this? My dear son, I entreat
+
+you never to make such an assertion again.�
+
+�I am not mad,� I cried energetically; �the sun and the heavens, who
+
+have viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth. I am the
+
+assassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations.
+
+A thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have
+
+saved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not
+
+sacrifice the whole human race.�
+
+The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were
+
+deranged, and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and
+
+endeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts. He wished as much as
+
+possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in
+
+Ireland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my
+
+misfortunes.
+
+As time passed away I became more calm; misery had her dwelling in my
+
+heart, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own
+
+crimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them. By the utmost
+
+self-violence I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, which
+
+sometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world, and my manners
+
+were calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey
+
+to the sea of ice.
+
+A few days before we left Paris on our way to Switzerland, I received the
+
+following letter from Elizabeth:
+
+�My dear Friend,
+
+�It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle
+
+dated at Paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and I may
+
+hope to see you in less than a fortnight. My poor cousin, how much you
+
+must have suffered! I expect to see you looking even more ill than
+
+when you quitted Geneva. This winter has been passed most miserably,
+
+tortured as I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in
+
+your countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of
+
+comfort and tranquillity.
+
+�Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable
+
+a year ago, even perhaps augmented by time. I would not disturb you at
+
+this period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you, but a
+
+conversation that I had with my uncle previous to his departure renders
+
+some explanation necessary before we meet.
+
+Explanation! You may possibly say, What can Elizabeth have to explain? If
+
+you really say this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied.
+
+But you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread and yet
+
+be pleased with this explanation; and in a probability of this being the
+
+case, I dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I
+
+have often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin.
+
+�You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan of
+
+your parents ever since our infancy. We were told this when young, and
+
+taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take
+
+place. We were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, I
+
+believe, dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older. But
+
+as brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each
+
+other without desiring a more intimate union, may not such also be our
+
+case? Tell me, dearest Victor. Answer me, I conjure you by our mutual
+
+happiness, with simple truth�Do you not love another?
+
+�You have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at
+
+Ingolstadt; and I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you last
+
+autumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of every
+
+creature, I could not help supposing that you might regret our
+
+connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of
+
+your parents, although they opposed themselves to your inclinations.
+
+But this is false reasoning. I confess to you, my friend, that I love
+
+you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant
+
+friend and companion. But it is your happiness I desire as well as my
+
+own when I declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally
+
+miserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice. Even now
+
+I weep to think that, borne down as you are by the cruellest
+
+misfortunes, you may stifle, by the word _honour_, all hope of that
+
+love and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself. I, who
+
+have so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries
+
+tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes. Ah! Victor, be assured
+
+that your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be
+
+made miserable by this supposition. Be happy, my friend; and if you
+
+obey me in this one request, remain satisfied that nothing on earth
+
+will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity.
+
+�Do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer tomorrow, or the
+
+next day, or even until you come, if it will give you pain. My uncle
+
+will send me news of your health, and if I see but one smile on your
+
+lips when we meet, occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine, I
+
+shall need no other happiness.
+
+�Elizabeth Lavenza.
+
+�Geneva, May 18th, 17��
+
+This letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat of
+
+the fiend��_I will be with you on your
+
+wedding-night!_� Such was my sentence, and on that night would the
+
+d�mon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of
+
+happiness which promised partly to console my sufferings. On that night he
+
+had determined to consummate his crimes by my death. Well, be it so; a
+
+deadly struggle would then assuredly take place, in which if he were
+
+victorious I should be at peace and his power over me be at an end. If he
+
+were vanquished, I should be a free man. Alas! What freedom? Such as the
+
+peasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, his
+
+cottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless,
+
+penniless, and alone, but free. Such would be my liberty except that in my
+
+Elizabeth I possessed a treasure, alas, balanced by those horrors of
+
+remorse and guilt which would pursue me until death.
+
+Sweet and beloved Elizabeth! I read and reread her letter, and some
+
+softened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal
+
+dreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the
+
+angel�s arm bared to drive me from all hope. Yet I would die to make
+
+her happy. If the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet,
+
+again, I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate. My
+
+destruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner, but if my torturer
+
+should suspect that I postponed it, influenced by his menaces, he would
+
+surely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge. He had vowed
+
+_to be with me on my wedding-night_, yet he did not consider that
+
+threat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show me that
+
+he was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered Clerval immediately
+
+after the enunciation of his threats. I resolved, therefore, that if my
+
+immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my
+
+father�s happiness, my adversary�s designs against my life
+
+should not retard it a single hour.
+
+In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth. My letter was calm and
+
+affectionate. �I fear, my beloved girl,� I said, �little happiness
+
+remains for us on earth; yet all that I may one day enjoy is centred in
+
+you. Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I consecrate my life
+
+and my endeavours for contentment. I have one secret, Elizabeth, a
+
+dreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with
+
+horror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only
+
+wonder that I survive what I have endured. I will confide this tale of
+
+misery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place,
+
+for, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us. But
+
+until then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it. This I most
+
+earnestly entreat, and I know you will comply.�
+
+In about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth�s letter we returned
+
+to Geneva. The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears were
+
+in her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. I saw a
+
+change in her also. She was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly
+
+vivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness and soft looks of
+
+compassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as I
+
+was.
+
+The tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure. Memory brought madness
+
+with it, and when I thought of what had passed, a real insanity possessed
+
+me; sometimes I was furious and burnt with rage, sometimes low and
+
+despondent. I neither spoke nor looked at anyone, but sat motionless,
+
+bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me.
+
+Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice
+
+would soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human
+
+feelings when sunk in torpor. She wept with me and for me. When reason
+
+returned, she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with
+
+resignation. Ah! It is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for the
+
+guilty there is no peace. The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is
+
+otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief.
+
+Soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with
+
+Elizabeth. I remained silent.
+
+�Have you, then, some other attachment?�
+
+�None on earth. I love Elizabeth and look forward to our union with
+
+delight. Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate
+
+myself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin.�
+
+�My dear Victor, do not speak thus. Heavy misfortunes have befallen
+
+us, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love
+
+for those whom we have lost to those who yet live. Our circle will be
+
+small but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune.
+
+And when time shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of
+
+care will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly
+
+deprived.�
+
+Such were the lessons of my father. But to me the remembrance of the
+
+threat returned; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend had
+
+yet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as
+
+invincible, and that when he had pronounced the words �_I shall be with
+
+you on your wedding-night_,� I should regard the threatened fate as
+
+unavoidable. But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth were
+
+balanced with it, and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful
+
+countenance, agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent, the
+
+ceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined,
+
+the seal to my fate.
+
+Great God! If for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish
+
+intention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myself
+
+for ever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over
+
+the earth than have consented to this miserable marriage. But, as if
+
+possessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real
+
+intentions; and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death, I
+
+hastened that of a far dearer victim.
+
+As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or
+
+a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me. But I concealed my
+
+feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the
+
+countenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer
+
+eye of Elizabeth. She looked forward to our union with placid contentment,
+
+not unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed,
+
+that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate
+
+into an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret.
+
+Preparations were made for the event, congratulatory visits were received,
+
+and all wore a smiling appearance. I shut up, as well as I could, in my own
+
+heart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness
+
+into the plans of my father, although they might only serve as the
+
+decorations of my tragedy. Through my father�s exertions a part of
+
+the inheritance of Elizabeth had been restored to her by the Austrian
+
+government. A small possession on the shores of Como belonged to her. It
+
+was agreed that, immediately after our union, we should proceed to Villa
+
+Lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake
+
+near which it stood.
+
+In the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the
+
+fiend should openly attack me. I carried pistols and a dagger
+
+constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and
+
+by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity. Indeed, as the
+
+period approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be
+
+regarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for
+
+in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed
+
+for its solemnisation drew nearer and I heard it continually spoken of
+
+as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.
+
+Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to
+
+calm her mind. But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my
+
+destiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her;
+
+and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which I had
+
+promised to reveal to her on the following day. My father was in the
+
+meantime overjoyed, and, in the bustle of preparation, only recognised in
+
+the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.
+
+After the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my
+
+father�s, but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence our
+
+journey by water, sleeping that night at Evian and continuing our
+
+voyage on the following day. The day was fair, the wind favourable;
+
+all smiled on our nuptial embarkation.
+
+Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the
+
+feeling of happiness. We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we
+
+were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the
+
+beauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw
+
+Mont Sal�ve, the pleasant banks of Montal�gre, and at a distance,
+
+surmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc, and the assemblage of snowy
+
+mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the
+
+opposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the
+
+ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost
+
+insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.
+
+I took the hand of Elizabeth. �You are sorrowful, my love. Ah! If
+
+you knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure, you would
+
+endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this
+
+one day at least permits me to enjoy.�
+
+�Be happy, my dear Victor,� replied Elizabeth; �there is, I hope,
+
+nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not
+
+painted in my face, my heart is contented. Something whispers to me
+
+not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but I
+
+will not listen to such a sinister voice. Observe how fast we move
+
+along and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise
+
+above the dome of Mont Blanc, render this scene of beauty still more
+
+interesting. Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in
+
+the clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at
+
+the bottom. What a divine day! How happy and serene all nature
+
+appears!�
+
+Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all
+
+reflection upon melancholy subjects. But her temper was fluctuating;
+
+joy for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave place
+
+to distraction and reverie.
+
+The sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance and
+
+observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the
+
+lower hills. The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached
+
+the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary. The
+
+spire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range
+
+of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.
+
+The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity,
+
+sank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water
+
+and caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the
+
+shore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and
+
+hay. The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touched
+
+the shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp
+
+me and cling to me for ever.

+Chapter 17
+
+The being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the
+
+expectation of a reply. But I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to
+
+arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his
+
+proposition. He continued,
+
+�You must create a female for me with whom I can live in the
+
+interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being. This you alone
+
+can do, and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to
+
+concede.�
+
+The latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had
+
+died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, and
+
+as he said this I could no longer suppress the rage that burned within
+
+me.
+
+�I do refuse it,� I replied; �and no torture shall ever extort a
+
+consent from me. You may render me the most miserable of men, but you
+
+shall never make me base in my own eyes. Shall I create another like
+
+yourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world. Begone! I
+
+have answered you; you may torture me, but I will never consent.�
+
+�You are in the wrong,� replied the fiend; �and instead
+
+of threatening, I am content to reason with you. I am malicious because I
+
+am miserable. Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind? You, my creator,
+
+would tear me to pieces and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I
+
+should pity man more than he pities me? You would not call it murder if you
+
+could precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts and destroy my frame, the
+
+work of your own hands. Shall I respect man when he condemns me? Let him
+
+live with me in the interchange of kindness, and instead of injury I would
+
+bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance.
+
+But that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our
+
+union. Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery. I will
+
+revenge my injuries; if I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear, and
+
+chiefly towards you my arch-enemy, because my creator, do I swear
+
+inextinguishable hatred. Have a care; I will work at your destruction, nor
+
+finish until I desolate your heart, so that you shall curse the hour of
+
+your birth.�
+
+A fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled
+
+into contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently
+
+he calmed himself and proceeded�
+
+�I intended to reason. This passion is detrimental to me, for you do
+
+not reflect that _you_ are the cause of its excess. If any being felt
+
+emotions of benevolence towards me, I should return them a hundred and a
+
+hundredfold; for that one creature�s sake I would make peace with the
+
+whole kind! But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realised.
+
+What I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a creature of
+
+another sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but it
+
+is all that I can receive, and it shall content me. It is true, we shall be
+
+monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more
+
+attached to one another. Our lives will not be happy, but they will be
+
+harmless and free from the misery I now feel. Oh! My creator, make me
+
+happy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit! Let me see that I
+
+excite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my
+
+request!�
+
+I was moved. I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences
+
+of my consent, but I felt that there was some justice in his argument.
+
+His tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature
+
+of fine sensations, and did I not as his maker owe him all the portion
+
+of happiness that it was in my power to bestow? He saw my change of
+
+feeling and continued,
+
+�If you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see
+
+us again; I will go to the vast wilds of South America. My food is not
+
+that of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite;
+
+acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment. My companion will
+
+be of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare.
+
+We shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on
+
+man and will ripen our food. The picture I present to you is peaceful
+
+and human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in the
+
+wantonness of power and cruelty. Pitiless as you have been towards me,
+
+I now see compassion in your eyes; let me seize the favourable moment
+
+and persuade you to promise what I so ardently desire.�
+
+�You propose,� replied I, �to fly from the habitations of
+
+man, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your
+
+only companions. How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man,
+
+persevere in this exile? You will return and again seek their kindness, and
+
+you will meet with their detestation; your evil passions will be renewed,
+
+and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction.
+
+This may not be; cease to argue the point, for I cannot consent.�
+
+�How inconstant are your feelings! But a moment ago you were moved by
+
+my representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints?
+
+I swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me, that
+
+with the companion you bestow, I will quit the neighbourhood of man and
+
+dwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of places. My evil passions
+
+will have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy! My life will flow quietly
+
+away, and in my dying moments I shall not curse my maker.�
+
+His words had a strange effect upon me. I compassionated him and
+
+sometimes felt a wish to console him, but when I looked upon him, when
+
+I saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened and my
+
+feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred. I tried to stifle
+
+these sensations; I thought that as I could not sympathise with him, I
+
+had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which
+
+was yet in my power to bestow.
+
+�You swear,� I said, �to be harmless; but have you not
+
+already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust
+
+you? May not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by
+
+affording a wider scope for your revenge?�
+
+�How is this? I must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer. If
+
+I have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion;
+
+the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shall
+
+become a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant. My vices
+
+are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor, and my virtues will
+
+necessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal. I shall feel
+
+the affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of
+
+existence and events from which I am now excluded.�
+
+I paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various
+
+arguments which he had employed. I thought of the promise of virtues which
+
+he had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight
+
+of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had
+
+manifested towards him. His power and threats were not omitted in my
+
+calculations; a creature who could exist in the ice-caves of the glaciers
+
+and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices
+
+was a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with. After a
+
+long pause of reflection I concluded that the justice due both to him and
+
+my fellow creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his request.
+
+Turning to him, therefore, I said,
+
+�I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe for ever,
+
+and every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shall
+
+deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile.�
+
+�I swear,� he cried, �by the sun, and by the blue sky of
+
+heaven, and by the fire of love that burns my heart, that if you grant my
+
+prayer, while they exist you shall never behold me again. Depart to your
+
+home and commence your labours; I shall watch their progress with
+
+unutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready I shall
+
+appear.�
+
+Saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in
+
+my sentiments. I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than
+
+the flight of an eagle, and quickly lost among the undulations of the
+
+sea of ice.
+
+His tale had occupied the whole day, and the sun was upon the verge of
+
+the horizon when he departed. I knew that I ought to hasten my descent
+
+towards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my
+
+heart was heavy, and my steps slow. The labour of winding among the
+
+little paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced
+
+perplexed me, occupied as I was by the emotions which the occurrences
+
+of the day had produced. Night was far advanced when I came to the
+
+halfway resting-place and seated myself beside the fountain. The stars
+
+shone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines
+
+rose before me, and every here and there a broken tree lay on the
+
+ground; it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange
+
+thoughts within me. I wept bitterly, and clasping my hands in agony, I
+
+exclaimed, �Oh! stars and clouds and winds, ye are all about to mock
+
+me; if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become as
+
+nought; but if not, depart, depart, and leave me in darkness.�
+
+These were wild and miserable thoughts, but I cannot describe to you
+
+how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how I
+
+listened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its
+
+way to consume me.
+
+Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I took no
+
+rest, but returned immediately to Geneva. Even in my own heart I could
+
+give no expression to my sensations�they weighed on me with a
+
+mountain�s weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them.
+
+Thus I returned home, and entering the house, presented myself to the
+
+family. My haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm, but I
+
+answered no question, scarcely did I speak. I felt as if I were placed
+
+under a ban�as if I had no right to claim their sympathies�as if
+
+never more might I enjoy companionship with them. Yet even thus I
+
+loved them to adoration; and to save them, I resolved to dedicate
+
+myself to my most abhorred task. The prospect of such an occupation
+
+made every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream,
+
+and that thought only had to me the reality of life.

+Chapter 1
+
+I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most
+
+distinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years
+
+counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public
+
+situations with honour and reputation. He was respected by all who
+
+knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public
+
+business. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the
+
+affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his
+
+marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a
+
+husband and the father of a family.
+
+As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot
+
+refrain from relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a
+
+merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous
+
+mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a
+
+proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty
+
+and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been
+
+distinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts,
+
+therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his
+
+daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in
+
+wretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and
+
+was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.
+
+He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct
+
+so little worthy of the affection that united them. He lost no time in
+
+endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin
+
+the world again through his credit and assistance.
+
+Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten
+
+months before my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery,
+
+he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the
+
+Reuss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort
+
+had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but
+
+it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in
+
+the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a
+
+merchant�s house. The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction;
+
+his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for
+
+reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end
+
+of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.
+
+His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw
+
+with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that
+
+there was no other prospect of support. But Caroline Beaufort
+
+possessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support
+
+her in her adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw and
+
+by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to
+
+support life.
+
+Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time
+
+was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence
+
+decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving
+
+her an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her, and she knelt
+
+by Beaufort�s coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the
+
+chamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who
+
+committed herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he
+
+conducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a
+
+relation. Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.
+
+There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but
+
+this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted
+
+affection. There was a sense of justice in my father�s upright mind
+
+which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love
+
+strongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the
+
+late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set
+
+a greater value on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and
+
+worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the
+
+doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her
+
+virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing
+
+her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace
+
+to his behaviour to her. Everything was made to yield to her wishes
+
+and her convenience. He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is
+
+sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her
+
+with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and
+
+benevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto
+
+constant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through. During
+
+the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had
+
+gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after
+
+their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change
+
+of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders,
+
+as a restorative for her weakened frame.
+
+From Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born
+
+at Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained
+
+for several years their only child. Much as they were attached to each
+
+other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very
+
+mine of love to bestow them upon me. My mother�s tender caresses and
+
+my father�s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my
+
+first recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something
+
+better�their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on
+
+them by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in
+
+their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled
+
+their duties towards me. With this deep consciousness of what they owed
+
+towards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit
+
+of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during
+
+every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity,
+
+and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but
+
+one train of enjoyment to me.
+
+For a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desired to have a
+
+daughter, but I continued their single offspring. When I was about five
+
+years old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they
+
+passed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como. Their benevolent
+
+disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor. This, to my
+
+mother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a
+
+passion�remembering what she had suffered, and how she had been
+
+relieved�for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the
+
+afflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale
+
+attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the number
+
+of half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst
+
+shape. One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother,
+
+accompanied by me, visited this abode. She found a peasant and his wife,
+
+hard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to
+
+five hungry babes. Among these there was one which attracted my mother far
+
+above all the rest. She appeared of a different stock. The four others were
+
+dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair. Her
+
+hair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her
+
+clothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head. Her brow was
+
+clear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of
+
+her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold
+
+her without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent,
+
+and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.
+
+The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and
+
+admiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. She was
+
+not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother was a
+
+German and had died on giving her birth. The infant had been placed with
+
+these good people to nurse: they were better off then. They had not been
+
+long married, and their eldest child was but just born. The father of their
+
+charge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory
+
+of Italy�one among the _schiavi ognor frementi,_ who exerted
+
+himself to obtain the liberty of his country. He became the victim of its
+
+weakness. Whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria
+
+was not known. His property was confiscated; his child became an orphan and
+
+a beggar. She continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude
+
+abode, fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.
+
+When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of
+
+our villa a child fairer than pictured cherub�a creature who seemed
+
+to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter
+
+than the chamois of the hills. The apparition was soon explained. With his
+
+permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their
+
+charge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence had seemed
+
+a blessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty
+
+and want when Providence afforded her such powerful protection. They
+
+consulted their village priest, and the result was that Elizabeth Lavenza
+
+became the inmate of my parents� house�my more than
+
+sister�the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and
+
+my pleasures.
+
+Everyone loved Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverential
+
+attachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, my
+
+pride and my delight. On the evening previous to her being brought to
+
+my home, my mother had said playfully, �I have a pretty present for my
+
+Victor�tomorrow he shall have it.� And when, on the morrow, she
+
+presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish
+
+seriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon Elizabeth
+
+as mine�mine to protect, love, and cherish. All praises bestowed on
+
+her I received as made to a possession of my own. We called each other
+
+familiarly by the name of cousin. No word, no expression could body
+
+forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me�my more than
+
+sister, since till death she was to be mine only.

+Chapter 6
+
+Clerval then put the following letter into my hands. It was from my
+
+own Elizabeth:
+
+�My dearest Cousin,
+
+�You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear
+
+kind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account. You are
+
+forbidden to write�to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor,
+
+is necessary to calm our apprehensions. For a long time I have thought
+
+that each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have
+
+restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt. I have
+
+prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so
+
+long a journey, yet how often have I regretted not being able to
+
+perform it myself! I figure to myself that the task of attending on
+
+your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never
+
+guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of
+
+your poor cousin. Yet that is over now: Clerval writes that indeed
+
+you are getting better. I eagerly hope that you will confirm this
+
+intelligence soon in your own handwriting.
+
+�Get well�and return to us. You will find a happy, cheerful home and
+
+friends who love you dearly. Your father�s health is vigorous, and he
+
+asks but to see you, but to be assured that you are well; and not a
+
+care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance. How pleased you would
+
+be to remark the improvement of our Ernest! He is now sixteen and full
+
+of activity and spirit. He is desirous to be a true Swiss and to enter
+
+into foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until his
+
+elder brother returns to us. My uncle is not pleased with the idea of
+
+a military career in a distant country, but Ernest never had your
+
+powers of application. He looks upon study as an odious fetter; his
+
+time is spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the
+
+lake. I fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point
+
+and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.
+
+�Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken
+
+place since you left us. The blue lake and snow-clad mountains�they
+
+never change; and I think our placid home and our contented hearts are
+
+regulated by the same immutable laws. My trifling occupations take up
+
+my time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing
+
+none but happy, kind faces around me. Since you left us, but one
+
+change has taken place in our little household. Do you remember on
+
+what occasion Justine Moritz entered our family? Probably you do not;
+
+I will relate her history, therefore in a few words. Madame Moritz,
+
+her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the
+
+third. This girl had always been the favourite of her father, but
+
+through a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and
+
+after the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill. My aunt observed
+
+this, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother
+
+to allow her to live at our house. The republican institutions of our
+
+country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which
+
+prevail in the great monarchies that surround it. Hence there is less
+
+distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the
+
+lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are
+
+more refined and moral. A servant in Geneva does not mean the same
+
+thing as a servant in France and England. Justine, thus received in
+
+our family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our
+
+fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a
+
+sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.
+
+�Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I
+
+recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one
+
+glance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that
+
+Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica�she looked so
+
+frank-hearted and happy. My aunt conceived a great attachment for her,
+
+by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that
+
+which she had at first intended. This benefit was fully repaid;
+
+Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world: I do not
+
+mean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but
+
+you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.
+
+Although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate,
+
+yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt. She
+
+thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her
+
+phraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.
+
+�When my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own
+
+grief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness
+
+with the most anxious affection. Poor Justine was very ill; but other
+
+trials were reserved for her.
+
+�One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the
+
+exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless. The
+
+conscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the
+
+deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her
+
+partiality. She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor
+
+confirmed the idea which she had conceived. Accordingly, a few months
+
+after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her
+
+repentant mother. Poor girl! She wept when she quitted our house; she
+
+was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness
+
+and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable
+
+for vivacity. Nor was her residence at her mother�s house of a nature
+
+to restore her gaiety. The poor woman was very vacillating in her
+
+repentance. She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness,
+
+but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her
+
+brothers and sister. Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz
+
+into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is
+
+now at peace for ever. She died on the first approach of cold weather,
+
+at the beginning of this last winter. Justine has just returned to us;
+
+and I assure you I love her tenderly. She is very clever and gentle,
+
+and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her
+
+expression continually remind me of my dear aunt.
+
+�I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling
+
+William. I wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with
+
+sweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair. When he
+
+smiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with
+
+health. He has already had one or two little _wives,_ but Louisa Biron
+
+is his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age.
+
+�Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little
+
+gossip concerning the good people of Geneva. The pretty Miss Mansfield
+
+has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching
+
+marriage with a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq. Her ugly
+
+sister, Manon, married M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn. Your
+
+favourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several misfortunes
+
+since the departure of Clerval from Geneva. But he has already
+
+recovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a
+
+lively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier. She is a widow, and much
+
+older than Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite with
+
+everybody.
+
+�I have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxiety
+
+returns upon me as I conclude. Write, dearest Victor,�one line�one
+
+word will be a blessing to us. Ten thousand thanks to Henry for his
+
+kindness, his affection, and his many letters; we are sincerely
+
+grateful. Adieu! my cousin; take care of yourself; and, I entreat
+
+you, write!
+
+�Elizabeth Lavenza.
+
+�Geneva, March 18th, 17�.�
+
+�Dear, dear Elizabeth!� I exclaimed, when I had read her
+
+letter: �I will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety
+
+they must feel.� I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but
+
+my convalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly. In another
+
+fortnight I was able to leave my chamber.
+
+One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the
+
+several professors of the university. In doing this, I underwent a
+
+kind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had
+
+sustained. Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the
+
+beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even
+
+to the name of natural philosophy. When I was otherwise quite restored
+
+to health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony
+
+of my nervous symptoms. Henry saw this, and had removed all my
+
+apparatus from my view. He had also changed my apartment; for he
+
+perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had
+
+previously been my laboratory. But these cares of Clerval were made of
+
+no avail when I visited the professors. M. Waldman inflicted torture
+
+when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I
+
+had made in the sciences. He soon perceived that I disliked the
+
+subject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to
+
+modesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the science
+
+itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out. What
+
+could I do? He meant to please, and he tormented me. I felt as if he
+
+had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which
+
+were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death. I
+
+writhed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt.
+
+Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the
+
+sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his
+
+total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn. I
+
+thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak. I saw plainly
+
+that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from
+
+me; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence
+
+that knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide in
+
+him that event which was so often present to my recollection, but which
+
+I feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply.
+
+M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of
+
+almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even
+
+more pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman. �D�n
+
+the fellow!� cried he; �why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has
+
+outstript us all. Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true. A
+
+youngster who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly
+
+as in the gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and if
+
+he is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.�Ay,
+
+ay,� continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering,
+
+�M. Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man.
+
+Young men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval: I was
+
+myself when young; but that wears out in a very short time.�
+
+M. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned
+
+the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.
+
+Clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science; and his
+
+literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me. He
+
+came to the university with the design of making himself complete
+
+master of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for
+
+the plan of life he had marked out for himself. Resolved to pursue no
+
+inglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording
+
+scope for his spirit of enterprise. The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit
+
+languages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on
+
+the same studies. Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I
+
+wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt
+
+great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not
+
+only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists. I
+
+did not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for
+
+I did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary
+
+amusement. I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well
+
+repaid my labours. Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy
+
+elevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of
+
+any other country. When you read their writings, life appears to
+
+consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses,�in the smiles and frowns
+
+of a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart. How
+
+different from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!
+
+Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was
+
+fixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several
+
+accidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable,
+
+and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring. I felt this
+
+delay very bitterly; for I longed to see my native town and my beloved
+
+friends. My return had only been delayed so long, from an
+
+unwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become
+
+acquainted with any of its inhabitants. The winter, however, was spent
+
+cheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came
+
+its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness.
+
+The month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily
+
+which was to fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed a
+
+pedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt, that I might bid a
+
+personal farewell to the country I had so long inhabited. I acceded
+
+with pleasure to this proposition: I was fond of exercise, and Clerval
+
+had always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature
+
+that I had taken among the scenes of my native country.
+
+We passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and spirits
+
+had long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the
+
+salubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and
+
+the conversation of my friend. Study had before secluded me from the
+
+intercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but
+
+Clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught
+
+me to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children.
+
+Excellent friend! how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to
+
+elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own. A selfish
+
+pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and
+
+affection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature
+
+who, a few years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care.
+
+When happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most
+
+delightful sensations. A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with
+
+ecstasy. The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring
+
+bloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud. I
+
+was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed
+
+upon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an
+
+invincible burden.
+
+Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: he
+
+exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled
+
+his soul. The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly
+
+astonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, in
+
+imitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful
+
+fancy and passion. At other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew
+
+me out into arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity.
+
+We returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were
+
+dancing, and every one we met appeared gay and happy. My own spirits were
+
+high, and I bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity.

+Letter 2
+
+_To Mrs. Saville, England._
+
+Archangel, 28th March, 17�.
+
+How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow!
+
+Yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a
+
+vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have
+
+already engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainly
+
+possessed of dauntless courage.
+
+But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the
+
+absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have no
+
+friend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there
+
+will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no
+
+one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts
+
+to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of
+
+feeling. I desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me, whose
+
+eyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I
+
+bitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet
+
+courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose
+
+tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a
+
+friend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution
+
+and too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me
+
+that I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild
+
+on a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas� books of voyages.
+
+At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own
+
+country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its
+
+most important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the
+
+necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native
+
+country. Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many
+
+schoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more and that my
+
+daydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters
+
+call it) _keeping;_ and I greatly need a friend who would have sense
+
+enough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to
+
+endeavour to regulate my mind.
+
+Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the
+
+wide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet
+
+some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these
+
+rugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage
+
+and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase
+
+more characteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is an
+
+Englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices,
+
+unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of
+
+humanity. I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel;
+
+finding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist
+
+in my enterprise.
+
+The master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the
+
+ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This
+
+circumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made
+
+me very desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years
+
+spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the
+
+groundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to
+
+the usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be
+
+necessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness
+
+of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt
+
+myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I heard
+
+of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the
+
+happiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story. Some years ago he loved
+
+a young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable
+
+sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw
+
+his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in
+
+tears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her,
+
+confessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor,
+
+and that her father would never consent to the union. My generous friend
+
+reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover,
+
+instantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his
+
+money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he
+
+bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his
+
+prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young
+
+woman�s father to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the old
+
+man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who,
+
+when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned
+
+until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her
+
+inclinations. �What a noble fellow!� you will exclaim. He is
+
+so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind
+
+of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct
+
+the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which
+
+otherwise he would command.
+
+Yet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can
+
+conceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am
+
+wavering in my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage
+
+is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. The
+
+winter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it
+
+is considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail
+
+sooner than I expected. I shall do nothing rashly: you know me
+
+sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the
+
+safety of others is committed to my care.
+
+I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my
+
+undertaking. It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of
+
+the trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which
+
+I am preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions, to �the
+
+land of mist and snow,� but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not
+
+be alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and
+
+woeful as the �Ancient Mariner.� You will smile at my allusion, but I
+
+will disclose a secret. I have often attributed my attachment to, my
+
+passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that
+
+production of the most imaginative of modern poets. There is something
+
+at work in my soul which I do not understand. I am practically
+
+industrious�painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and
+
+labour�but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief
+
+in the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out
+
+of the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited
+
+regions I am about to explore.
+
+But to return to dearer considerations. Shall I meet you again, after
+
+having traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of
+
+Africa or America? I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to
+
+look on the reverse of the picture. Continue for the present to write to
+
+me by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when
+
+I need them most to support my spirits. I love you very tenderly. 
+
+Remember me with affection, should you never hear from me again.
+
+Your affectionate brother,
+
+Robert Walton

+Chapter 2
+
+We were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in
+
+our ages. I need not say that we were strangers to any species of
+
+disunion or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and
+
+the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us
+
+nearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated
+
+disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense
+
+application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge.
+
+She busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets;
+
+and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss
+
+home �the sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons,
+
+tempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of
+
+our Alpine summers�she found ample scope for admiration and delight.
+
+While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the
+
+magnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their
+
+causes. The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine.
+
+Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature,
+
+gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the
+
+earliest sensations I can remember.
+
+On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave
+
+up entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native
+
+country. We possessed a house in Geneva, and a _campagne_ on Belrive,
+
+the eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a
+
+league from the city. We resided principally in the latter, and the
+
+lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion. It was my
+
+temper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few. I was
+
+indifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but I united
+
+myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them. Henry
+
+Clerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of singular
+
+talent and fancy. He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for
+
+its own sake. He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance. He
+
+composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and
+
+knightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays and to enter into
+
+masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of
+
+Roncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous
+
+train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands
+
+of the infidels.
+
+No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. My
+
+parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence.
+
+We felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to
+
+their caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights
+
+which we enjoyed. When I mingled with other families I distinctly
+
+discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted
+
+the development of filial love.
+
+My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some
+
+law in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits
+
+but to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things
+
+indiscriminately. I confess that neither the structure of languages,
+
+nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states
+
+possessed attractions for me. It was the secrets of heaven and earth
+
+that I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of
+
+things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man
+
+that occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical,
+
+or in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.
+
+Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral
+
+relations of things. The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes,
+
+and the actions of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream was
+
+to become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the
+
+gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species. The saintly soul
+
+of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home.
+
+Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of
+
+her celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us. She was
+
+the living spirit of love to soften and attract; I might have become
+
+sullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that
+
+she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness. And
+
+Clerval�could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval? Yet
+
+he might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his
+
+generosity, so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for
+
+adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of
+
+beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring
+
+ambition.
+
+I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood,
+
+before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of
+
+extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self. Besides,
+
+in drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those events which
+
+led, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when I would
+
+account to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my
+
+destiny I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost
+
+forgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent
+
+which, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.
+
+Natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire,
+
+therefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my
+
+predilection for that science. When I was thirteen years of age we all went
+
+on a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon; the inclemency of the
+
+weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In this house I
+
+chanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa. I opened it
+
+with apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful
+
+facts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm. A new
+
+light seemed to dawn upon my mind, and bounding with joy, I communicated my
+
+discovery to my father. My father looked carelessly at the title page of my
+
+book and said, �Ah! Cornelius Agrippa! My dear Victor, do not waste
+
+your time upon this; it is sad trash.�
+
+If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me
+
+that the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern
+
+system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers
+
+than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, while
+
+those of the former were real and practical, under such circumstances I
+
+should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside and have contented my
+
+imagination, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to my
+
+former studies. It is even possible that the train of my ideas would never
+
+have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin. But the cursory glance
+
+my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was
+
+acquainted with its contents, and I continued to read with the greatest
+
+avidity.
+
+When I returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this
+
+author, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read and
+
+studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me
+
+treasures known to few besides myself. I have described myself as always
+
+having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of
+
+nature. In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern
+
+philosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied.
+
+Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking
+
+up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his
+
+successors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted
+
+appeared even to my boy�s apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same
+
+pursuit.
+
+The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted
+
+with their practical uses. The most learned philosopher knew little
+
+more. He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal
+
+lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery. He might dissect,
+
+anatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes
+
+in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him. I
+
+had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep
+
+human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and
+
+ignorantly I had repined.
+
+But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew
+
+more. I took their word for all that they averred, and I became their
+
+disciple. It may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth
+
+century; but while I followed the routine of education in the schools of
+
+Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self-taught with regard to my favourite
+
+studies. My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a
+
+child�s blindness, added to a student�s thirst for knowledge.
+
+Under the guidance of my new preceptors I entered with the greatest
+
+diligence into the search of the philosopher�s stone and the elixir
+
+of life; but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention. Wealth was an
+
+inferior object, but what glory would attend the discovery if I could
+
+banish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but
+
+a violent death!
+
+Nor were these my only visions. The raising of ghosts or devils was a
+
+promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of which
+
+I most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I
+
+attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a
+
+want of skill or fidelity in my instructors. And thus for a time I was
+
+occupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand
+
+contradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of
+
+multifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childish
+
+reasoning, till an accident again changed the current of my ideas.
+
+When I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near
+
+Belrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm. It
+
+advanced from behind the mountains of Jura, and the thunder burst at once
+
+with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. I remained,
+
+while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight.
+
+As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an
+
+old and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so
+
+soon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing
+
+remained but a blasted stump. When we visited it the next morning, we found
+
+the tree shattered in a singular manner. It was not splintered by the
+
+shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood. I never beheld
+
+anything so utterly destroyed.
+
+Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of
+
+electricity. On this occasion a man of great research in natural
+
+philosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on
+
+the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of
+
+electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me.
+
+All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa,
+
+Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by
+
+some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my
+
+accustomed studies. It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever
+
+be known. All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew
+
+despicable. By one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps
+
+most subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former
+
+occupations, set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed
+
+and abortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for a
+
+would-be science which could never even step within the threshold of
+
+real knowledge. In this mood of mind I betook myself to the
+
+mathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as
+
+being built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration.
+
+Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments
+
+are we bound to prosperity or ruin. When I look back, it seems to me
+
+as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the
+
+immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life�the last effort
+
+made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even
+
+then hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me. Her victory was
+
+announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which
+
+followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting
+
+studies. It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil with
+
+their prosecution, happiness with their disregard.
+
+It was a strong effort of the spirit of good, but it was ineffectual.
+
+Destiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and
+
+terrible destruction.

+Chapter 21
+
+I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old
+
+benevolent man with calm and mild manners. He looked upon me, however,
+
+with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors,
+
+he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.
+
+About half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the
+
+magistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with
+
+his son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o�clock,
+
+they observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in
+
+for port. It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did
+
+not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about
+
+two miles below. He walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle,
+
+and his companions followed him at some distance. As he was proceeding
+
+along the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his
+
+length on the ground. His companions came up to assist him, and by the
+
+light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man,
+
+who was to all appearance dead. Their first supposition was that it was the
+
+corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the
+
+waves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even
+
+that the body was not then cold. They instantly carried it to the cottage
+
+of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it
+
+to life. It appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty
+
+years of age. He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of
+
+any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck.
+
+The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but
+
+when the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder of
+
+my brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a
+
+mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for
+
+support. The magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew
+
+an unfavourable augury from my manner.
+
+The son confirmed his father�s account, but when Daniel Nugent was
+
+called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, he
+
+saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore;
+
+and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same
+
+boat in which I had just landed.
+
+A woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door
+
+of her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour
+
+before she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with
+
+only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse
+
+was afterwards found.
+
+Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the
+
+body into her house; it was not cold. They put it into a bed and
+
+rubbed it, and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was
+
+quite gone.
+
+Several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed
+
+that, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it
+
+was very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been
+
+obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed.
+
+Besides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body
+
+from another place, and it was likely that as I did not appear to know
+
+the shore, I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance
+
+of the town of �� from the place where I had deposited the corpse.
+
+Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken into
+
+the room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed what
+
+effect the sight of it would produce upon me. This idea was probably
+
+suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the
+
+murder had been described. I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate
+
+and several other persons, to the inn. I could not help being struck by the
+
+strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but,
+
+knowing that I had been conversing with several persons in the island I had
+
+inhabited about the time that the body had been found, I was perfectly
+
+tranquil as to the consequences of the affair.
+
+I entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin. How
+
+can I describe my sensations on beholding it? I feel yet parched with
+
+horror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and
+
+agony. The examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses,
+
+passed like a dream from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry
+
+Clerval stretched before me. I gasped for breath, and throwing myself on
+
+the body, I exclaimed, �Have my murderous machinations deprived you
+
+also, my dearest Henry, of life? Two I have already destroyed; other
+
+victims await their destiny; but you, Clerval, my friend, my
+
+benefactor��
+
+The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and
+
+I was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.
+
+A fever succeeded to this. I lay for two months on the point of death; my
+
+ravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the
+
+murderer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval. Sometimes I entreated my
+
+attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was
+
+tormented; and at others I felt the fingers of the monster already grasping
+
+my neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror. Fortunately, as I spoke
+
+my native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and
+
+bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.
+
+Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not
+
+sink into forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming
+
+children, the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and
+
+youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the
+
+next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb! Of what materials was I
+
+made that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of
+
+the wheel, continually renewed the torture?
+
+But I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from
+
+a dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by
+
+gaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon.
+
+It was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I had
+
+forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some
+
+great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around
+
+and saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which I
+
+was, all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly.
+
+This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside
+
+me. She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her
+
+countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise
+
+that class. The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of
+
+persons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery. Her
+
+tone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English,
+
+and the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings.
+
+�Are you better now, sir?� said she.
+
+I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, �I believe I am;
+
+but if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am
+
+still alive to feel this misery and horror.�
+
+�For that matter,� replied the old woman, �if you mean about the
+
+gentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you
+
+were dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you! However, that�s none
+
+of my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I do my duty
+
+with a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same.�
+
+I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a
+
+speech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt
+
+languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed. The whole series
+
+of my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it
+
+were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force
+
+of reality.
+
+As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew
+
+feverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed
+
+me with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me. The
+
+physician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared
+
+them for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the
+
+expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the
+
+second. Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the
+
+hangman who would gain his fee?
+
+These were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had
+
+shown me extreme kindness. He had caused the best room in the prison
+
+to be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who
+
+had provided a physician and a nurse. It is true, he seldom came to
+
+see me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of
+
+every human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and
+
+miserable ravings of a murderer. He came, therefore, sometimes to see
+
+that I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long
+
+intervals.
+
+One day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes
+
+half open and my cheeks livid like those in death. I was overcome by gloom
+
+and misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to
+
+remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. At one time I
+
+considered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the
+
+penalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been. Such were my
+
+thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin entered.
+
+His countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to
+
+mine and addressed me in French,
+
+�I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anything to
+
+make you more comfortable?�
+
+�I thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole
+
+earth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving.�
+
+�I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to
+
+one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune. But you will, I
+
+hope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can
+
+easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.�
+
+�That is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, become
+
+the most miserable of mortals. Persecuted and tortured as I am and
+
+have been, can death be any evil to me?�
+
+�Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the
+
+strange chances that have lately occurred. You were thrown, by some
+
+surprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality,
+
+seized immediately, and charged with murder. The first sight that was
+
+presented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so
+
+unaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend across
+
+your path.�
+
+As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on
+
+this retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at
+
+the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me. I suppose some
+
+astonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for Mr. Kirwin hastened
+
+to say,
+
+�Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on
+
+your person were brought me, and I examined them that I might discover some
+
+trace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfortune
+
+and illness. I found several letters, and, among others, one which I
+
+discovered from its commencement to be from your father. I instantly wrote
+
+to Geneva; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter.
+
+But you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any
+
+kind.�
+
+�This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event;
+
+tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am
+
+now to lament?�
+
+�Your family is perfectly well,� said Mr. Kirwin with
+
+gentleness; �and someone, a friend, is come to visit you.�
+
+I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it
+
+instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my
+
+misery and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for
+
+me to comply with his hellish desires. I put my hand before my eyes,
+
+and cried out in agony,
+
+�Oh! Take him away! I cannot see him; for God�s sake, do not
+
+let him enter!�
+
+Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance. He could not help
+
+regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in
+
+rather a severe tone,
+
+�I should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father
+
+would have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.�
+
+�My father!� cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed
+
+from anguish to pleasure. �Is my father indeed come? How kind, how
+
+very kind! But where is he, why does he not hasten to me?�
+
+My change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he
+
+thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium,
+
+and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence. He rose and
+
+quitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.
+
+Nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the
+
+arrival of my father. I stretched out my hand to him and cried,
+
+�Are you then safe�and Elizabeth�and Ernest?�
+
+My father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by
+
+dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my
+
+desponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of
+
+cheerfulness. �What a place is this that you inhabit, my son!�
+
+said he, looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance
+
+of the room. �You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems
+
+to pursue you. And poor Clerval��
+
+The name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too
+
+great to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears.
+
+�Alas! Yes, my father,� replied I; �some destiny of the
+
+most horrible kind hangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely I
+
+should have died on the coffin of Henry.�
+
+We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the
+
+precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that
+
+could ensure tranquillity. Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted that my
+
+strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion. But the
+
+appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I
+
+gradually recovered my health.
+
+As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black
+
+melancholy that nothing could dissipate. The image of Clerval was
+
+for ever before me, ghastly and murdered. More than once the agitation
+
+into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous
+
+relapse. Alas! Why did they preserve so miserable and detested a
+
+life? It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny, which is now
+
+drawing to a close. Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these
+
+throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears
+
+me to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also
+
+sink to rest. Then the appearance of death was distant, although the
+
+wish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours
+
+motionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that
+
+might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.
+
+The season of the assizes approached. I had already been three months
+
+in prison, and although I was still weak and in continual danger of a
+
+relapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country
+
+town where the court was held. Mr. Kirwin charged himself with every
+
+care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence. I was spared
+
+the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not
+
+brought before the court that decides on life and death. The grand
+
+jury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the Orkney
+
+Islands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight
+
+after my removal I was liberated from prison.
+
+My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a
+
+criminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh
+
+atmosphere and permitted to return to my native country. I did not
+
+participate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or a
+
+palace were alike hateful. The cup of life was poisoned for ever, and
+
+although the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, I
+
+saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by
+
+no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me. Sometimes
+
+they were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark
+
+orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed
+
+them; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as I
+
+first saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt.
+
+My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection. He talked
+
+of Geneva, which I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; but
+
+these words only drew deep groans from me. Sometimes, indeed, I felt a
+
+wish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved
+
+cousin or longed, with a devouring _maladie du pays_, to see once more
+
+the blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early
+
+childhood; but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a
+
+prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and
+
+these fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and
+
+despair. At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the
+
+existence I loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance
+
+to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence.
+
+Yet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally
+
+triumphed over my selfish despair. It was necessary that I should
+
+return without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of those
+
+I so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any
+
+chance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to
+
+blast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an end to
+
+the existence of the monstrous image which I had endued with the
+
+mockery of a soul still more monstrous. My father still desired to
+
+delay our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the fatigues of a
+
+journey, for I was a shattered wreck�the shadow of a human being. My
+
+strength was gone. I was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day
+
+preyed upon my wasted frame.
+
+Still, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatience,
+
+my father thought it best to yield. We took our passage on board a vessel
+
+bound for Havre-de-Grace and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores.
+
+It was midnight. I lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to
+
+the dashing of the waves. I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my
+
+sight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should
+
+soon see Geneva. The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream;
+
+yet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested
+
+shore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly
+
+that I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my friend and dearest
+
+companion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation. I
+
+repassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residing
+
+with my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for
+
+Ingolstadt. I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on
+
+to the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night in
+
+which he first lived. I was unable to pursue the train of thought; a
+
+thousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly.
+
+Ever since my recovery from the fever, I had been in the custom of taking
+
+every night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was by means of this drug
+
+only that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of
+
+life. Oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, I now
+
+swallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly. But sleep did
+
+not afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a
+
+thousand objects that scared me. Towards morning I was possessed by a kind
+
+of nightmare; I felt the fiend�s grasp in my neck and could not free
+
+myself from it; groans and cries rang in my ears. My father, who was
+
+watching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves
+
+were around, the cloudy sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense of
+
+security, a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour
+
+and the irresistible, disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm
+
+forgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly
+
+susceptible.

+Chapter 11
+
+�It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of
+
+my being; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct.
+
+A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard,
+
+and smelt at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I
+
+learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses. By
+
+degrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I
+
+was obliged to shut my eyes. Darkness then came over me and troubled
+
+me, but hardly had I felt this when, by opening my eyes, as I now
+
+suppose, the light poured in upon me again. I walked and, I believe,
+
+descended, but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations.
+
+Before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my
+
+touch or sight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, with
+
+no obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid. The light
+
+became more and more oppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as I
+
+walked, I sought a place where I could receive shade. This was the
+
+forest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting
+
+from my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst. This
+
+roused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I
+
+found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground. I slaked my thirst
+
+at the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.
+
+�It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half frightened, as it
+
+were, instinctively, finding myself so desolate. Before I had quitted
+
+your apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some
+
+clothes, but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of
+
+night. I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could
+
+distinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat
+
+down and wept.
+
+�Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of
+
+pleasure. I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the
+
+trees. [The moon] I gazed with a kind of wonder. It moved slowly,
+
+but it enlightened my path, and I again went out in search of berries.
+
+I was still cold when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, with
+
+which I covered myself, and sat down upon the ground. No distinct
+
+ideas occupied my mind; all was confused. I felt light, and hunger,
+
+and thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my ears, and on
+
+all sides various scents saluted me; the only object that I could
+
+distinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with
+
+pleasure.
+
+�Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had
+
+greatly lessened, when I began to distinguish my sensations from each
+
+other. I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with
+
+drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage. I was delighted
+
+when I first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my
+
+ears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had
+
+often intercepted the light from my eyes. I began also to observe,
+
+with greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the
+
+boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me. Sometimes I
+
+tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable.
+
+Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the
+
+uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into
+
+silence again.
+
+�The moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened
+
+form, showed itself, while I still remained in the forest. My
+
+sensations had by this time become distinct, and my mind received every
+
+day additional ideas. My eyes became accustomed to the light and to
+
+perceive objects in their right forms; I distinguished the insect from
+
+the herb, and by degrees, one herb from another. I found that the
+
+sparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird and
+
+thrush were sweet and enticing.
+
+�One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been
+
+left by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the
+
+warmth I experienced from it. In my joy I thrust my hand into the live
+
+embers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain. How strange,
+
+I thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects! I
+
+examined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be
+
+composed of wood. I quickly collected some branches, but they were wet
+
+and would not burn. I was pained at this and sat still watching the
+
+operation of the fire. The wet wood which I had placed near the heat
+
+dried and itself became inflamed. I reflected on this, and by touching
+
+the various branches, I discovered the cause and busied myself in
+
+collecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it and have a
+
+plentiful supply of fire. When night came on and brought sleep with
+
+it, I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished. I
+
+covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches
+
+upon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and sank
+
+into sleep.
+
+�It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire.
+
+I uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame. I
+
+observed this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the
+
+embers when they were nearly extinguished. When night came again I
+
+found, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and that
+
+the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for I found
+
+some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, and
+
+tasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees. I
+
+tried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on
+
+the live embers. I found that the berries were spoiled by this
+
+operation, and the nuts and roots much improved.
+
+�Food, however, became scarce, and I often spent the whole day
+
+searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. When
+
+I found this, I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto
+
+inhabited, to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would be
+
+more easily satisfied. In this emigration I exceedingly lamented the
+
+loss of the fire which I had obtained through accident and knew not how
+
+to reproduce it. I gave several hours to the serious consideration of
+
+this difficulty, but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply
+
+it, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood
+
+towards the setting sun. I passed three days in these rambles and at
+
+length discovered the open country. A great fall of snow had taken
+
+place the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white; the
+
+appearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold
+
+damp substance that covered the ground.
+
+�It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and
+
+shelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which
+
+had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd. This
+
+was a new sight to me, and I examined the structure with great
+
+curiosity. Finding the door open, I entered. An old man sat in it,
+
+near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast. He turned on
+
+hearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the
+
+hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form
+
+hardly appeared capable. His appearance, different from any I had ever
+
+before seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me. But I was enchanted
+
+by the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not
+
+penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite
+
+and divine a retreat as Pand�monium appeared to the d�mons of hell
+
+after their sufferings in the lake of fire. I greedily devoured the
+
+remnants of the shepherd�s breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese,
+
+milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like. Then, overcome by
+
+fatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep.
+
+�It was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which
+
+shone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my
+
+travels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant�s breakfast in a
+
+wallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, until
+
+at sunset I arrived at a village. How miraculous did this appear! The
+
+huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by
+
+turns. The vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw
+
+placed at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite. One
+
+of the best of these I entered, but I had hardly placed my foot within
+
+the door before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted.
+
+The whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until,
+
+grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, I
+
+escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel,
+
+quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had
+
+beheld in the village. This hovel however, joined a cottage of a neat
+
+and pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, I
+
+dared not enter it. My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so
+
+low that I could with difficulty sit upright in it. No wood, however,
+
+was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and
+
+although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an
+
+agreeable asylum from the snow and rain.
+
+�Here, then, I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter,
+
+however miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more
+
+from the barbarity of man. As soon as morning dawned I crept from my
+
+kennel, that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could
+
+remain in the habitation I had found. It was situated against the back
+
+of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig
+
+sty and a clear pool of water. One part was open, and by that I had
+
+crept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived
+
+with stones and wood, yet in such a manner that I might move them on
+
+occasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty, and
+
+that was sufficient for me.
+
+�Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, I
+
+retired, for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered
+
+too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power. I
+
+had first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf
+
+of coarse bread, which I purloined, and a cup with which I could drink
+
+more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by
+
+my retreat. The floor was a little raised, so that it was kept
+
+perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was
+
+tolerably warm.
+
+�Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel until
+
+something should occur which might alter my determination. It was
+
+indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence,
+
+the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth. I ate my breakfast with
+
+pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little
+
+water when I heard a step, and looking through a small chink, I beheld
+
+a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel. The
+
+girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found
+
+cottagers and farmhouse servants to be. Yet she was meanly dressed, a
+
+coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair
+
+hair was plaited but not adorned: she looked patient yet sad. I lost
+
+sight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing
+
+the pail, which was now partly filled with milk. As she walked along,
+
+seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose
+
+countenance expressed a deeper despondence. Uttering a few sounds with
+
+an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the
+
+cottage himself. She followed, and they disappeared. Presently I saw
+
+the young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field
+
+behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the
+
+house and sometimes in the yard.
+
+�On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the
+
+cottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been
+
+filled up with wood. In one of these was a small and almost
+
+imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate.
+
+Through this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean
+
+but very bare of furniture. In one corner, near a small fire, sat an
+
+old man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude. The
+
+young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she
+
+took something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat
+
+down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play
+
+and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the
+
+nightingale. It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had
+
+never beheld aught beautiful before. The silver hair and benevolent
+
+countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle
+
+manners of the girl enticed my love. He played a sweet mournful air
+
+which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of
+
+which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then
+
+pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt
+
+at his feet. He raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection
+
+that I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were
+
+a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never before experienced,
+
+either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from the
+
+window, unable to bear these emotions.
+
+�Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a
+
+load of wood. The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of
+
+his burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on
+
+the fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage,
+
+and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese. She seemed
+
+pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she
+
+placed in water, and then upon the fire. She afterwards continued her
+
+work, whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily
+
+employed in digging and pulling up roots. After he had been employed
+
+thus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they entered the
+
+cottage together.
+
+�The old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearance
+
+of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to
+
+eat. The meal was quickly dispatched. The young woman was again
+
+occupied in arranging the cottage, the old man walked before the
+
+cottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth.
+
+Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent
+
+creatures. One was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming
+
+with benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in his
+
+figure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry, yet his
+
+eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency. The
+
+old man returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools different
+
+from those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across the
+
+fields.
+
+�Night quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, I found that the
+
+cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers, and was
+
+delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the
+
+pleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours. In the evening
+
+the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations
+
+which I did not understand; and the old man again took up the
+
+instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in
+
+the morning. So soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play,
+
+but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the
+
+harmony of the old man�s instrument nor the songs of the birds; I since
+
+found that he read aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of the
+
+science of words or letters.
+
+�The family, after having been thus occupied for a short time,
+
+extinguished their lights and retired, as I conjectured, to rest.�

+Chapter 24
+
+My present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was
+
+swallowed up and lost. I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone
+
+endowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and
+
+allowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise
+
+delirium or death would have been my portion.
+
+My first resolution was to quit Geneva for ever; my country, which, when I
+
+was happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became
+
+hateful. I provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few jewels
+
+which had belonged to my mother, and departed.
+
+And now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life. I have
+
+traversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships
+
+which travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet. How I
+
+have lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing limbs upon
+
+the sandy plain and prayed for death. But revenge kept me alive; I dared
+
+not die and leave my adversary in being.
+
+When I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which I
+
+might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy. But my plan was unsettled,
+
+and I wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertain
+
+what path I should pursue. As night approached I found myself at the
+
+entrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father
+
+reposed. I entered it and approached the tomb which marked their
+
+graves. Everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, which
+
+were gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the
+
+scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested
+
+observer. The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to
+
+cast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the
+
+mourner.
+
+The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to
+
+rage and despair. They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived,
+
+and to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence. I knelt on the grass
+
+and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, �By the
+
+sacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the
+
+deep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the
+
+spirits that preside over thee, to pursue the d�mon who caused this misery,
+
+until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict. For this purpose I will
+
+preserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will I again behold the sun
+
+and tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from my
+
+eyes for ever. And I call on you, spirits of the dead, and on you, wandering
+
+ministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work. Let the cursed
+
+and hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now
+
+torments me.�
+
+I had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me
+
+that the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion, but
+
+the furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage choked my utterance.
+
+I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish
+
+laugh. It rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed
+
+it, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter.
+
+Surely in that moment I should have been possessed by frenzy and have
+
+destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that I
+
+was reserved for vengeance. The laughter died away, when a well-known
+
+and abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an
+
+audible whisper, �I am satisfied, miserable wretch! You have
+
+determined to live, and I am satisfied.�
+
+I darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devil
+
+eluded my grasp. Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone
+
+full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than
+
+mortal speed.
+
+I pursued him, and for many months this has been my task. Guided by a
+
+slight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly. The
+
+blue Mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the fiend
+
+enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea. I
+
+took my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how.
+
+Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I
+
+have ever followed in his track. Sometimes the peasants, scared by
+
+this horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself,
+
+who feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die,
+
+left some mark to guide me. The snows descended on my head, and I saw
+
+the print of his huge step on the white plain. To you first entering
+
+on life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand
+
+what I have felt and still feel? Cold, want, and fatigue were the
+
+least pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil
+
+and carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good
+
+followed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly
+
+extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties. Sometimes,
+
+when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast
+
+was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me. The
+
+fare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but
+
+I will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had
+
+invoked to aid me. Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and
+
+I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the
+
+few drops that revived me, and vanish.
+
+I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the d�mon
+
+generally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the
+
+country chiefly collected. In other places human beings were seldom
+
+seen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my
+
+path. I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers
+
+by distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed,
+
+which, after taking a small part, I always presented to those who had
+
+provided me with fire and utensils for cooking.
+
+My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during
+
+sleep alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! Often, when most
+
+miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The
+
+spirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of
+
+happiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage. Deprived of
+
+this respite, I should have sunk under my hardships. During the day I was
+
+sustained and inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my
+
+friends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolent
+
+countenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth�s
+
+voice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth. Often, when wearied by
+
+a toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should
+
+come and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest
+
+friends. What agonising fondness did I feel for them! How did I cling to
+
+their dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and
+
+persuade myself that they still lived! At such moments vengeance, that
+
+burned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards the
+
+destruction of the d�mon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the
+
+mechanical impulse of some power of which I was unconscious, than as the
+
+ardent desire of my soul.
+
+What his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know. Sometimes, indeed, he
+
+left marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided
+
+me and instigated my fury. �My reign is not yet
+
+over��these words were legible in one of these
+
+inscriptions��you live, and my power is complete. Follow me; I
+
+seek the everlasting ices of the north, where you will feel the misery of
+
+cold and frost, to which I am impassive. You will find near this place, if
+
+you follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed. Come on, my
+
+enemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives, but many hard and miserable
+
+hours must you endure until that period shall arrive.�
+
+Scoffing devil! Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee,
+
+miserable fiend, to torture and death. Never will I give up my search
+
+until he or I perish; and then with what ecstasy shall I join my
+
+Elizabeth and my departed friends, who even now prepare for me the
+
+reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage!
+
+As I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened and the
+
+cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support. The peasants were
+
+shut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to
+
+seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to
+
+seek for prey. The rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be
+
+procured; and thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance.
+
+The triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours. One
+
+inscription that he left was in these words: �Prepare! Your toils
+
+only begin; wrap yourself in furs and provide food, for we shall soon enter
+
+upon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting
+
+hatred.�
+
+My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I
+
+resolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on Heaven to support
+
+me, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts,
+
+until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary
+
+of the horizon. Oh! How unlike it was to the blue seasons of the
+
+south! Covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by
+
+its superior wildness and ruggedness. The Greeks wept for joy when
+
+they beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed with
+
+rapture the boundary of their toils. I did not weep, but I knelt down
+
+and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in
+
+safety to the place where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversary�s gibe,
+
+to meet and grapple with him.
+
+Some weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs and thus
+
+traversed the snows with inconceivable speed. I know not whether the
+
+fiend possessed the same advantages, but I found that, as before I had
+
+daily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so that
+
+when I first saw the ocean he was but one day�s journey in advance, and
+
+I hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach. With new
+
+courage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched
+
+hamlet on the seashore. I inquired of the inhabitants concerning the
+
+fiend and gained accurate information. A gigantic monster, they said,
+
+had arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols,
+
+putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of
+
+his terrific appearance. He had carried off their store of winter
+
+food, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a
+
+numerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same
+
+night, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his
+
+journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they
+
+conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the
+
+ice or frozen by the eternal frosts.
+
+On hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair.
+
+He had escaped me, and I must commence a destructive and almost endless
+
+journey across the mountainous ices of the ocean, amidst cold that few
+
+of the inhabitants could long endure and which I, the native of a
+
+genial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive. Yet at the idea
+
+that the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance
+
+returned, and like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling.
+
+After a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hovered
+
+round and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for my journey.
+
+I exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of
+
+the Frozen Ocean, and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I
+
+departed from land.
+
+I cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but I have endured
+
+misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution
+
+burning within my heart could have enabled me to support. Immense and
+
+rugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and I often heard
+
+the thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction. But
+
+again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure.
+
+By the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that
+
+I had passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction
+
+of hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of
+
+despondency and grief from my eyes. Despair had indeed almost secured
+
+her prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery. Once, after
+
+the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the
+
+summit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue,
+
+died, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye
+
+caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain. I strained my sight to
+
+discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I
+
+distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known
+
+form within. Oh! With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart!
+
+Warm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might
+
+not intercept the view I had of the d�mon; but still my sight was
+
+dimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that
+
+oppressed me, I wept aloud.
+
+But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their
+
+dead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after an
+
+hour�s rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly
+
+irksome to me, I continued my route. The sledge was still visible, nor
+
+did I again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short
+
+time some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags. I indeed
+
+perceptibly gained on it, and when, after nearly two days� journey, I
+
+beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within
+
+me.
+
+But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were
+
+suddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I had
+
+ever done before. A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, as
+
+the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more ominous
+
+and terrific. I pressed on, but in vain. The wind arose; the sea roared;
+
+and, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with a
+
+tremendous and overwhelming sound. The work was soon finished; in a few
+
+minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, and I was left
+
+drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and
+
+thus preparing for me a hideous death.
+
+In this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died, and I
+
+myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when I saw your
+
+vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life.
+
+I had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded
+
+at the sight. I quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars, and
+
+by these means was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in
+
+the direction of your ship. I had determined, if you were going southwards,
+
+still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my
+
+purpose. I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue
+
+my enemy. But your direction was northwards. You took me on board when my
+
+vigour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk under my multiplied
+
+hardships into a death which I still dread, for my task is unfulfilled.
+
+Oh! When will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the d�mon, allow
+
+me the rest I so much desire; or must I die, and he yet live? If I do,
+
+swear to me, Walton, that he shall not escape, that you will seek him
+
+and satisfy my vengeance in his death. And do I dare to ask of you to
+
+undertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that I have undergone?
+
+No; I am not so selfish. Yet, when I am dead, if he should appear, if
+
+the ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you, swear that he
+
+shall not live�swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated
+
+woes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes. He is eloquent
+
+and persuasive, and once his words had even power over my heart; but
+
+trust him not. His soul is as hellish as his form, full of treachery
+
+and fiend-like malice. Hear him not; call on the names of William,
+
+Justine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched Victor, and
+
+thrust your sword into his heart. I will hover near and direct the
+
+steel aright.
+
+Walton, _in continuation._
+
+August 26th, 17�.
+
+You have read this strange and terrific story, Margaret; and do you not
+
+feel your blood congeal with horror, like that which even now curdles
+
+mine? Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his
+
+tale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with
+
+difficulty the words so replete with anguish. His fine and lovely eyes
+
+were now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow
+
+and quenched in infinite wretchedness. Sometimes he commanded his
+
+countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a
+
+tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a
+
+volcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression
+
+of the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor.
+
+His tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth,
+
+yet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he showed me,
+
+and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me a
+
+greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations,
+
+however earnest and connected. Such a monster has, then, really existence!
+
+I cannot doubt it, yet I am lost in surprise and admiration. Sometimes I
+
+endeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the particulars of his
+
+creature�s formation, but on this point he was impenetrable.
+
+�Are you mad, my friend?� said he. �Or whither does your
+
+senseless curiosity lead you? Would you also create for yourself and the
+
+world a demoniacal enemy? Peace, peace! Learn my miseries and do not seek
+
+to increase your own.�
+
+Frankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history; he asked
+
+to see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places,
+
+but principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held
+
+with his enemy. �Since you have preserved my narration,� said
+
+he, �I would not that a mutilated one should go down to
+
+posterity.�
+
+Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest
+
+tale that ever imagination formed. My thoughts and every feeling of my
+
+soul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale
+
+and his own elevated and gentle manners have created. I wish to soothe
+
+him, yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of
+
+every hope of consolation, to live? Oh, no! The only joy that he can
+
+now know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and
+
+death. Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and
+
+delirium; he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his
+
+friends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or
+
+excitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his
+
+fancy, but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a
+
+remote world. This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render
+
+them to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth.
+
+Our conversations are not always confined to his own history and
+
+misfortunes. On every point of general literature he displays
+
+unbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension. His
+
+eloquence is forcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when he relates
+
+a pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love,
+
+without tears. What a glorious creature must he have been in the days
+
+of his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin! He seems
+
+to feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall.
+
+�When younger,� said he, �I believed myself destined for
+
+some great enterprise. My feelings are profound, but I possessed a coolness
+
+of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements. This sentiment of
+
+the worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed,
+
+for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that
+
+might be useful to my fellow creatures. When I reflected on the work I had
+
+completed, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational
+
+animal, I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors. But
+
+this thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now
+
+serves only to plunge me lower in the dust. All my speculations and hopes
+
+are as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am
+
+chained in an eternal hell. My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of
+
+analysis and application were intense; by the union of these qualities I
+
+conceived the idea and executed the creation of a man. Even now I cannot
+
+recollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete. I trod
+
+heaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea
+
+of their effects. From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty
+
+ambition; but how am I sunk! Oh! My friend, if you had known me as I once
+
+was, you would not recognise me in this state of degradation. Despondency
+
+rarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell,
+
+never, never again to rise.�
+
+Must I then lose this admirable being? I have longed for a friend; I have
+
+sought one who would sympathise with and love me. Behold, on these desert
+
+seas I have found such a one, but I fear I have gained him only to know his
+
+value and lose him. I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea.
+
+�I thank you, Walton,� he said, �for your kind intentions towards so
+
+miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and fresh
+
+affections, think you that any can replace those who are gone? Can any
+
+man be to me as Clerval was, or any woman another Elizabeth? Even
+
+where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence,
+
+the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our
+
+minds which hardly any later friend can obtain. They know our
+
+infantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified,
+
+are never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more
+
+certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives. A sister or a
+
+brother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early,
+
+suspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend,
+
+however strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be
+
+contemplated with suspicion. But I enjoyed friends, dear not only
+
+through habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever
+
+I am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the conversation of
+
+Clerval will be ever whispered in my ear. They are dead, and but one
+
+feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life. If I
+
+were engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive
+
+utility to my fellow creatures, then could I live to fulfil it. But
+
+such is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I
+
+gave existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and I may die.�
+
+My beloved Sister,
+
+September 2d.
+
+I write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am ever
+
+doomed to see again dear England and the dearer friends that inhabit
+
+it. I am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and
+
+threaten every moment to crush my vessel. The brave fellows whom I
+
+have persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid, but I have
+
+none to bestow. There is something terribly appalling in our
+
+situation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert me. Yet it is
+
+terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered
+
+through me. If we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause.
+
+And what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind? You will not hear of my
+
+destruction, and you will anxiously await my return. Years will pass, and
+
+you will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope. Oh! My
+
+beloved sister, the sickening failing of your heart-felt expectations is,
+
+in prospect, more terrible to me than my own death. But you have a husband
+
+and lovely children; you may be happy. Heaven bless you and make you so!
+
+My unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion. He
+
+endeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession
+
+which he valued. He reminds me how often the same accidents have
+
+happened to other navigators who have attempted this sea, and in spite
+
+of myself, he fills me with cheerful auguries. Even the sailors feel
+
+the power of his eloquence; when he speaks, they no longer despair; he
+
+rouses their energies, and while they hear his voice they believe these
+
+vast mountains of ice are mole-hills which will vanish before the
+
+resolutions of man. These feelings are transitory; each day of
+
+expectation delayed fills them with fear, and I almost dread a mutiny
+
+caused by this despair.
+
+September 5th.
+
+A scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that, although it is
+
+highly probable that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannot
+
+forbear recording it.
+
+We are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger
+
+of being crushed in their conflict. The cold is excessive, and many of
+
+my unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of
+
+desolation. Frankenstein has daily declined in health; a feverish fire
+
+still glimmers in his eyes, but he is exhausted, and when suddenly
+
+roused to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent
+
+lifelessness.
+
+I mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a mutiny.
+
+This morning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend�his
+
+eyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly�I was roused by half
+
+a dozen of the sailors, who demanded admission into the cabin. They
+
+entered, and their leader addressed me. He told me that he and his
+
+companions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation
+
+to me to make me a requisition which, in justice, I could not refuse.
+
+We were immured in ice and should probably never escape, but they
+
+feared that if, as was possible, the ice should dissipate and a free
+
+passage be opened, I should be rash enough to continue my voyage and
+
+lead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted
+
+this. They insisted, therefore, that I should engage with a solemn
+
+promise that if the vessel should be freed I would instantly direct my
+
+course southwards.
+
+This speech troubled me. I had not despaired, nor had I yet conceived
+
+the idea of returning if set free. Yet could I, in justice, or even in
+
+possibility, refuse this demand? I hesitated before I answered, when
+
+Frankenstein, who had at first been silent, and indeed appeared hardly
+
+to have force enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled,
+
+and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour. Turning towards the men,
+
+he said,
+
+�What do you mean? What do you demand of your captain? Are you, then,
+
+so easily turned from your design? Did you not call this a glorious
+
+expedition? �And wherefore was it glorious? Not because the way was
+
+smooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and
+
+terror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth
+
+and your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded it, and
+
+these you were to brave and overcome. For this was it a glorious, for this
+
+was it an honourable undertaking. You were hereafter to be hailed as the
+
+benefactors of your species, your names adored as belonging to brave men
+
+who encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind. And now,
+
+behold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first
+
+mighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away and are content
+
+to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and
+
+peril; and so, poor souls, they were chilly and returned to their warm
+
+firesides. Why, that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come
+
+thus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove
+
+yourselves cowards. Oh! Be men, or be more than men. Be steady to your
+
+purposes and firm as a rock. This ice is not made of such stuff as your
+
+hearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it
+
+shall not. Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace
+
+marked on your brows. Return as heroes who have fought and conquered and
+
+who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe.�
+
+He spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed
+
+in his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can
+
+you wonder that these men were moved? They looked at one another and were
+
+unable to reply. I spoke; I told them to retire and consider of what had
+
+been said, that I would not lead them farther north if they strenuously
+
+desired the contrary, but that I hoped that, with reflection, their courage
+
+would return.
+
+They retired and I turned towards my friend, but he was sunk in languor and
+
+almost deprived of life.
+
+How all this will terminate, I know not, but I had rather die than
+
+return shamefully, my purpose unfulfilled. Yet I fear such will be my
+
+fate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never
+
+willingly continue to endure their present hardships.
+
+September 7th.
+
+The die is cast; I have consented to return if we are not destroyed.
+
+Thus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; I come back
+
+ignorant and disappointed. It requires more philosophy than I possess
+
+to bear this injustice with patience.
+
+September 12th.
+
+It is past; I am returning to England. I have lost my hopes of utility
+
+and glory; I have lost my friend. But I will endeavour to detail these
+
+bitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and while I am wafted
+
+towards England and towards you, I will not despond.
+
+September 9th, the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder were heard
+
+at a distance as the islands split and cracked in every direction. We were
+
+in the most imminent peril, but as we could only remain passive, my chief
+
+attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in
+
+such a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed. The ice cracked
+
+behind us and was driven with force towards the north; a breeze sprang from
+
+the west, and on the 11th the passage towards the south became perfectly
+
+free. When the sailors saw this and that their return to their native
+
+country was apparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them,
+
+loud and long-continued. Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked the
+
+cause of the tumult. �They shout,� I said, �because they
+
+will soon return to England.�
+
+�Do you, then, really return?�
+
+�Alas! Yes; I cannot withstand their demands. I cannot lead them
+
+unwillingly to danger, and I must return.�
+
+�Do so, if you will; but I will not. You may give up your purpose, but
+
+mine is assigned to me by Heaven, and I dare not. I am weak, but
+
+surely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with
+
+sufficient strength.� Saying this, he endeavoured to spring from the
+
+bed, but the exertion was too great for him; he fell back and fainted.
+
+It was long before he was restored, and I often thought that life was
+
+entirely extinct. At length he opened his eyes; he breathed with
+
+difficulty and was unable to speak. The surgeon gave him a composing
+
+draught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed. In the meantime he
+
+told me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live.
+
+His sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve and be patient. I sat
+
+by his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; but
+
+presently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near,
+
+said, �Alas! The strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall
+
+soon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being. Think
+
+not, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning
+
+hatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed; but I feel myself
+
+justified in desiring the death of my adversary. During these last days I
+
+have been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do I find it blamable.
+
+In a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature and was
+
+bound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and
+
+well-being. This was my duty, but there was another still paramount to
+
+that. My duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to
+
+my attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or
+
+misery. Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to
+
+create a companion for the first creature. He showed unparalleled malignity
+
+and selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction
+
+beings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I
+
+know where this thirst for vengeance may end. Miserable himself that he may
+
+render no other wretched, he ought to die. The task of his destruction was
+
+mine, but I have failed. When actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I
+
+asked you to undertake my unfinished work, and I renew this request now,
+
+when I am only induced by reason and virtue.
+
+�Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil
+
+this task; and now that you are returning to England, you will have
+
+little chance of meeting with him. But the consideration of these
+
+points, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, I
+
+leave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near
+
+approach of death. I dare not ask you to do what I think right, for I
+
+may still be misled by passion.
+
+�That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in
+
+other respects, this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is the
+
+only happy one which I have enjoyed for several years. The forms of
+
+the beloved dead flit before me, and I hasten to their arms. Farewell,
+
+Walton! Seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition, even if it
+
+be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in
+
+science and discoveries. Yet why do I say this? I have myself been
+
+blasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed.�
+
+His voice became fainter as he spoke, and at length, exhausted by his
+
+effort, he sank into silence. About half an hour afterwards he
+
+attempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and
+
+his eyes closed for ever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed
+
+away from his lips.
+
+Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this
+
+glorious spirit? What can I say that will enable you to understand the
+
+depth of my sorrow? All that I should express would be inadequate and
+
+feeble. My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of
+
+disappointment. But I journey towards England, and I may there find
+
+consolation.
+
+I am interrupted. What do these sounds portend? It is midnight; the
+
+breeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir. Again there
+
+is a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin
+
+where the remains of Frankenstein still lie. I must arise and examine.
+
+Good night, my sister.
+
+Great God! what a scene has just taken place! I am yet dizzy with the
+
+remembrance of it. I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail
+
+it; yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete without this
+
+final and wonderful catastrophe.
+
+I entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable
+
+friend. Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to
+
+describe�gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its
+
+proportions. As he hung over the coffin, his face was concealed by long
+
+locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour and
+
+apparent texture like that of a mummy. When he heard the sound of my
+
+approach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung
+
+towards the window. Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, of
+
+such loathsome yet appalling hideousness. I shut my eyes involuntarily and
+
+endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer.
+
+I called on him to stay.
+
+He paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the
+
+lifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and
+
+every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some
+
+uncontrollable passion.
+
+�That is also my victim!� he exclaimed. �In his murder my
+
+crimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its
+
+close! Oh, Frankenstein! Generous and self-devoted being! What does it
+
+avail that I now ask thee to pardon me? I, who irretrievably destroyed thee
+
+by destroying all thou lovedst. Alas! He is cold, he cannot answer
+
+me.�
+
+His voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested to
+
+me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his
+
+enemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion. I
+
+approached this tremendous being; I dared not again raise my eyes to his
+
+face, there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness. I
+
+attempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips. The monster
+
+continued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches. At length I
+
+gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion.
+
+�Your repentance,� I said, �is now superfluous. If you
+
+had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse
+
+before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity,
+
+Frankenstein would yet have lived.�
+
+�And do you dream?� said the d�mon. �Do you think that I was then
+
+dead to agony and remorse? He,� he continued, pointing to the corpse,
+
+�he suffered not in the consummation of the deed. Oh! Not the
+
+ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the
+
+lingering detail of its execution. A frightful selfishness hurried me
+
+on, while my heart was poisoned with remorse. Think you that the
+
+groans of Clerval were music to my ears? My heart was fashioned to be
+
+susceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice
+
+and hatred, it did not endure the violence of the change without
+
+torture such as you cannot even imagine.
+
+�After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken
+
+and overcome. I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; I
+
+abhorred myself. But when I discovered that he, the author at once of
+
+my existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for
+
+happiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me
+
+he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the
+
+indulgence of which I was for ever barred, then impotent envy and bitter
+
+indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance. I
+
+recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished. I
+
+knew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture, but I was the
+
+slave, not the master, of an impulse which I detested yet could not
+
+disobey. Yet when she died! Nay, then I was not miserable. I had
+
+cast off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my
+
+despair. Evil thenceforth became my good. Urged thus far, I had no
+
+choice but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly
+
+chosen. The completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable
+
+passion. And now it is ended; there is my last victim!�
+
+I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I called
+
+to mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and
+
+persuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my
+
+friend, indignation was rekindled within me. �Wretch!� I said.
+
+�It is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you
+
+have made. You throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are
+
+consumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall. Hypocritical fiend!
+
+If he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again would
+
+he become the prey, of your accursed vengeance. It is not pity that you
+
+feel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn
+
+from your power.�
+
+�Oh, it is not thus�not thus,� interrupted the being.
+
+�Yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to
+
+be the purport of my actions. Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery.
+
+No sympathy may I ever find. When I first sought it, it was the love of
+
+virtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being
+
+overflowed, that I wished to be participated. But now that virtue has
+
+become to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into
+
+bitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy? I am
+
+content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I am
+
+well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory. Once
+
+my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once
+
+I falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would
+
+love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding. I was
+
+nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion. But now crime has
+
+degraded me beneath the meanest animal. No guilt, no mischief, no
+
+malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine. When I run over the
+
+frightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same
+
+creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent
+
+visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness. But it is even so; the
+
+fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man
+
+had friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone.
+
+�You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my
+
+crimes and his misfortunes. But in the detail which he gave you of them
+
+he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured
+
+wasting in impotent passions. For while I destroyed his hopes, I did
+
+not satisfy my own desires. They were for ever ardent and craving; still
+
+I desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned. Was there no
+
+injustice in this? Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all
+
+humankind sinned against me? Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his
+
+friend from his door with contumely? Why do you not execrate the rustic
+
+who sought to destroy the saviour of his child? Nay, these are virtuous
+
+and immaculate beings! I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an
+
+abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on. Even now my
+
+blood boils at the recollection of this injustice.
+
+�But it is true that I am a wretch. I have murdered the lovely and
+
+the helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to
+
+death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing. I have
+
+devoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and
+
+admiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that
+
+irremediable ruin. There he lies, white and cold in death. You hate me, but
+
+your abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself. I look on the
+
+hands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the
+
+imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands
+
+will meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more.
+
+�Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief. My work
+
+is nearly complete. Neither yours nor any man�s death is needed to
+
+consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done,
+
+but it requires my own. Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this
+
+sacrifice. I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me
+
+thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I shall
+
+collect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its
+
+remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would
+
+create such another as I have been. I shall die. I shall no longer feel the
+
+agonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet
+
+unquenched. He is dead who called me into being; and when I shall be no
+
+more, the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish. I shall no
+
+longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks. Light,
+
+feeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition must I find my
+
+happiness. Some years ago, when the images which this world affords first
+
+opened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the
+
+rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were all to
+
+me, I should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation. Polluted by
+
+crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in
+
+death?
+
+�Farewell! I leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom these
+
+eyes will ever behold. Farewell, Frankenstein! If thou wert yet alive
+
+and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better
+
+satiated in my life than in my destruction. But it was not so; thou
+
+didst seek my extinction, that I might not cause greater wretchedness;
+
+and if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think
+
+and feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than
+
+that which I feel. Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to
+
+thine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my
+
+wounds until death shall close them for ever.
+
+�But soon,� he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm, �I
+
+shall die, and what I now feel be no longer felt. Soon these burning
+
+miseries will be extinct. I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and
+
+exult in the agony of the torturing flames. The light of that conflagration
+
+will fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds. My spirit
+
+will sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus.
+
+Farewell.�
+
+He sprang from the cabin-window as he said this, upon the ice raft
+
+which lay close to the vessel. He was soon borne away by the waves and
+
+lost in darkness and distance.

+Chapter 15
+
+�Such was the history of my beloved cottagers. It impressed me deeply.
+
+I learned, from the views of social life which it developed, to admire
+
+their virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind.
+
+�As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil, benevolence and
+
+generosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to
+
+become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities
+
+were called forth and displayed. But in giving an account of the
+
+progress of my intellect, I must not omit a circumstance which occurred
+
+in the beginning of the month of August of the same year.
+
+�One night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where I
+
+collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors, I found on
+
+the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and
+
+some books. I eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel. 
+
+Fortunately the books were written in the language, the elements of which I
+
+had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of _Paradise Lost_, a volume
+
+of _Plutarch�s Lives_, and the _Sorrows of Werter_. The
+
+possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I now continually
+
+studied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were
+
+employed in their ordinary occupations.
+
+�I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books. They produced
+
+in me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me
+
+to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. In
+
+the _Sorrows of Werter_, besides the interest of its simple and affecting
+
+story, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon
+
+what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a
+
+never-ending source of speculation and astonishment. The gentle and
+
+domestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and
+
+feelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded
+
+well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which
+
+were for ever alive in my own bosom. But I thought Werter himself a
+
+more divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character
+
+contained no pretension, but it sank deep. The disquisitions upon
+
+death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder. I did not
+
+pretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards
+
+the opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely
+
+understanding it.
+
+�As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and
+
+condition. I found myself similar yet at the same time strangely
+
+unlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I
+
+was a listener. I sympathised with and partly understood them, but I
+
+was unformed in mind; I was dependent on none and related to none.
+
+�The path of my departure was free,� and there was none to lament my
+
+annihilation. My person was hideous and my stature gigantic. What did
+
+this mean? Who was I? What was I? Whence did I come? What was my
+
+destination? These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to
+
+solve them.
+
+�The volume of _Plutarch�s Lives_ which I possessed contained the
+
+histories of the first founders of the ancient republics. This book
+
+had a far different effect upon me from the _Sorrows of Werter_. I
+
+learned from Werter�s imaginations despondency and gloom, but Plutarch
+
+taught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my
+
+own reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages. Many
+
+things I read surpassed my understanding and experience. I had a very
+
+confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers,
+
+and boundless seas. But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns and
+
+large assemblages of men. The cottage of my protectors had been the
+
+only school in which I had studied human nature, but this book
+
+developed new and mightier scenes of action. I read of men concerned
+
+in public affairs, governing or massacring their species. I felt the
+
+greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as
+
+far as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they
+
+were, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone. Induced by these
+
+feelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa,
+
+Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus. The
+
+patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a
+
+firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had
+
+been made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should
+
+have been imbued with different sensations.
+
+�But _Paradise Lost_ excited different and far deeper emotions. I read
+
+it, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as
+
+a true history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the
+
+picture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of
+
+exciting. I often referred the several situations, as their similarity
+
+struck me, to my own. Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to
+
+any other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine
+
+in every other respect. He had come forth from the hands of God a
+
+perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of
+
+his Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from
+
+beings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone.
+
+Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for
+
+often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter
+
+gall of envy rose within me.
+
+�Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings. Soon
+
+after my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of
+
+the dress which I had taken from your laboratory. At first I had
+
+neglected them, but now that I was able to decipher the characters in
+
+which they were written, I began to study them with diligence. It was
+
+your journal of the four months that preceded my creation. You
+
+minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress
+
+of your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic
+
+occurrences. You doubtless recollect these papers. Here they are.
+
+Everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed
+
+origin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances
+
+which produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious
+
+and loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own
+
+horrors and rendered mine indelible. I sickened as I read. �Hateful
+
+day when I received life!� I exclaimed in agony. �Accursed creator!
+
+Why did you form a monster so hideous that even _you_ turned from me in
+
+disgust? God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own
+
+image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the
+
+very resemblance. Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire
+
+and encourage him, but I am solitary and abhorred.�
+
+�These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude;
+
+but when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable and
+
+benevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should
+
+become acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they would
+
+compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity. Could they turn
+
+from their door one, however monstrous, who solicited their compassion
+
+and friendship? I resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way
+
+to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate. I
+
+postponed this attempt for some months longer, for the importance
+
+attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail.
+
+Besides, I found that my understanding improved so much with every
+
+day�s experience that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking
+
+until a few more months should have added to my sagacity.
+
+�Several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage. The
+
+presence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and I also
+
+found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there. Felix and Agatha
+
+spent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in
+
+their labours by servants. They did not appear rich, but they were
+
+contented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful, while
+
+mine became every day more tumultuous. Increase of knowledge only
+
+discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was. I
+
+cherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when I beheld my person
+
+reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail
+
+image and that inconstant shade.
+
+�I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial
+
+which in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my
+
+thoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and
+
+dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my
+
+feelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breathed
+
+smiles of consolation. But it was all a dream; no Eve soothed my
+
+sorrows nor shared my thoughts; I was alone. I remembered Adam�s
+
+supplication to his Creator. But where was mine? He had abandoned me,
+
+and in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him.
+
+�Autumn passed thus. I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay
+
+and fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it
+
+had worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon. Yet I did
+
+not heed the bleakness of the weather; I was better fitted by my
+
+conformation for the endurance of cold than heat. But my chief
+
+delights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gay
+
+apparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with more attention
+
+towards the cottagers. Their happiness was not decreased by the
+
+absence of summer. They loved and sympathised with one another; and
+
+their joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by the
+
+casualties that took place around them. The more I saw of them, the
+
+greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my
+
+heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures; to see
+
+their sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost
+
+limit of my ambition. I dared not think that they would turn them from
+
+me with disdain and horror. The poor that stopped at their door were
+
+never driven away. I asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a
+
+little food or rest: I required kindness and sympathy; but I did not
+
+believe myself utterly unworthy of it.
+
+�The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken
+
+place since I awoke into life. My attention at this time was solely
+
+directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my
+
+protectors. I revolved many projects, but that on which I finally
+
+fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone.
+
+I had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my
+
+person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly
+
+beheld me. My voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I
+
+thought, therefore, that if in the absence of his children I could gain
+
+the good will and mediation of the old De Lacey, I might by his means
+
+be tolerated by my younger protectors.
+
+�One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground
+
+and diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha,
+
+and Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own
+
+desire, was left alone in the cottage. When his children had departed,
+
+he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, more
+
+sweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before. At first his
+
+countenance was illuminated with pleasure, but as he continued,
+
+thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the
+
+instrument, he sat absorbed in reflection.
+
+�My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which
+
+would decide my hopes or realise my fears. The servants were gone to a
+
+neighbouring fair. All was silent in and around the cottage; it was an
+
+excellent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my
+
+limbs failed me and I sank to the ground. Again I rose, and exerting
+
+all the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I had
+
+placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat. The fresh air revived
+
+me, and with renewed determination I approached the door of their
+
+cottage.
+
+�I knocked. �Who is there?� said the old man. �Come in.�
+
+�I entered. �Pardon this intrusion,� said I; �I am
+
+a traveller in want of a little rest; you would greatly oblige me if you
+
+would allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire.�
+
+��Enter,� said De Lacey, �and I will try in what
+
+manner I can to relieve your wants; but, unfortunately, my children are
+
+from home, and as I am blind, I am afraid I shall find it difficult to
+
+procure food for you.�
+
+��Do not trouble yourself, my kind host; I have food; it is
+
+warmth and rest only that I need.�
+
+�I sat down, and a silence ensued. I knew that every minute was
+
+precious to me, yet I remained irresolute in what manner to commence
+
+the interview, when the old man addressed me.
+
+�By your language, stranger, I suppose you are my countryman; are you
+
+French?�
+
+��No; but I was educated by a French family and understand that
+
+language only. I am now going to claim the protection of some friends,
+
+whom I sincerely love, and of whose favour I have some hopes.�
+
+��Are they Germans?�
+
+��No, they are French. But let us change the subject. I am an
+
+unfortunate and deserted creature, I look around and I have no relation
+
+or friend upon earth. These amiable people to whom I go have never
+
+seen me and know little of me. I am full of fears, for if I fail
+
+there, I am an outcast in the world for ever.�
+
+��Do not despair. To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate, but
+
+the hearts of men, when unprejudiced by any obvious self-interest, are
+
+full of brotherly love and charity. Rely, therefore, on your hopes;
+
+and if these friends are good and amiable, do not despair.�
+
+��They are kind�they are the most excellent creatures in the world;
+
+but, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me. I have good
+
+dispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree
+
+beneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes, and where they
+
+ought to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold only a detestable
+
+monster.�
+
+��That is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless, cannot
+
+you undeceive them?�
+
+��I am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account that I
+
+feel so many overwhelming terrors. I tenderly love these friends; I
+
+have, unknown to them, been for many months in the habits of daily
+
+kindness towards them; but they believe that I wish to injure them, and
+
+it is that prejudice which I wish to overcome.�
+
+��Where do these friends reside?�
+
+��Near this spot.�
+
+�The old man paused and then continued, �If you will unreservedly
+
+confide to me the particulars of your tale, I perhaps may be of use in
+
+undeceiving them. I am blind and cannot judge of your countenance, but
+
+there is something in your words which persuades me that you are
+
+sincere. I am poor and an exile, but it will afford me true pleasure
+
+to be in any way serviceable to a human creature.�
+
+��Excellent man! I thank you and accept your generous offer. You
+
+raise me from the dust by this kindness; and I trust that, by your aid,
+
+I shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow
+
+creatures.�
+
+��Heaven forbid! Even if you were really criminal, for that can only
+
+drive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue. I also am
+
+unfortunate; I and my family have been condemned, although innocent;
+
+judge, therefore, if I do not feel for your misfortunes.�
+
+��How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor? From your lips
+
+first have I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; I shall
+
+be for ever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success
+
+with those friends whom I am on the point of meeting.�
+
+��May I know the names and residence of those friends?�
+
+�I paused. This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was to
+
+rob me of or bestow happiness on me for ever. I struggled vainly for
+
+firmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all my
+
+remaining strength; I sank on the chair and sobbed aloud. At that
+
+moment I heard the steps of my younger protectors. I had not a moment
+
+to lose, but seizing the hand of the old man, I cried, �Now is the
+
+time! Save and protect me! You and your family are the friends whom I
+
+seek. Do not you desert me in the hour of trial!�
+
+��Great God!� exclaimed the old man. �Who are you?�
+
+�At that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix, Safie, and
+
+Agatha entered. Who can describe their horror and consternation on
+
+beholding me? Agatha fainted, and Safie, unable to attend to her
+
+friend, rushed out of the cottage. Felix darted forward, and with
+
+supernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung, in
+
+a transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently
+
+with a stick. I could have torn him limb from limb, as the lion rends
+
+the antelope. But my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness, and
+
+I refrained. I saw him on the point of repeating his blow, when,
+
+overcome by pain and anguish, I quitted the cottage, and in the general
+
+tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel.�

+Chapter 16
+
+�Cursed, cursed creator! Why did I live? Why, in that instant, did I
+
+not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly
+
+bestowed? I know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my
+
+feelings were those of rage and revenge. I could with pleasure have
+
+destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with
+
+their shrieks and misery.
+
+�When night came I quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood; and
+
+now, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my
+
+anguish in fearful howlings. I was like a wild beast that had broken
+
+the toils, destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging
+
+through the wood with a stag-like swiftness. Oh! What a miserable
+
+night I passed! The cold stars shone in mockery, and the bare trees
+
+waved their branches above me; now and then the sweet voice of a bird
+
+burst forth amidst the universal stillness. All, save I, were at rest
+
+or in enjoyment; I, like the arch-fiend, bore a hell within me, and
+
+finding myself unsympathised with, wished to tear up the trees, spread
+
+havoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyed
+
+the ruin.
+
+�But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I became
+
+fatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in
+
+the sick impotence of despair. There was none among the myriads of men
+
+that existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness
+
+towards my enemies? No; from that moment I declared everlasting war
+
+against the species, and more than all, against him who had formed me
+
+and sent me forth to this insupportable misery.
+
+�The sun rose; I heard the voices of men and knew that it was
+
+impossible to return to my retreat during that day. Accordingly I hid
+
+myself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours
+
+to reflection on my situation.
+
+�The pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some
+
+degree of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the
+
+cottage, I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my
+
+conclusions. I had certainly acted imprudently. It was apparent that
+
+my conversation had interested the father in my behalf, and I was a
+
+fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children. I
+
+ought to have familiarised the old De Lacey to me, and by degrees to
+
+have discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have
+
+been prepared for my approach. But I did not believe my errors to be
+
+irretrievable, and after much consideration I resolved to return to the
+
+cottage, seek the old man, and by my representations win him to my
+
+party.
+
+�These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profound
+
+sleep; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by
+
+peaceful dreams. The horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever
+
+acting before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged Felix
+
+tearing me from his father�s feet. I awoke exhausted, and finding that
+
+it was already night, I crept forth from my hiding-place, and went in
+
+search of food.
+
+�When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the
+
+well-known path that conducted to the cottage. All there was at peace.
+
+I crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the
+
+accustomed hour when the family arose. That hour passed, the sun
+
+mounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers did not appear. I
+
+trembled violently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune. The inside
+
+of the cottage was dark, and I heard no motion; I cannot describe the
+
+agony of this suspense.
+
+�Presently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the cottage, they
+
+entered into conversation, using violent gesticulations; but I did not
+
+understand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country,
+
+which differed from that of my protectors. Soon after, however, Felix
+
+approached with another man; I was surprised, as I knew that he had not
+
+quitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover from
+
+his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances.
+
+��Do you consider,� said his companion to him,
+
+�that you will be obliged to pay three months� rent and to lose
+
+the produce of your garden? I do not wish to take any unfair advantage, and
+
+I beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your
+
+determination.�
+
+��It is utterly useless,� replied Felix; �we can
+
+never again inhabit your cottage. The life of my father is in the greatest
+
+danger, owing to the dreadful circumstance that I have related. My wife and
+
+my sister will never recover from their horror. I entreat you not to reason
+
+with me any more. Take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this
+
+place.�
+
+�Felix trembled violently as he said this. He and his companion
+
+entered the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and then
+
+departed. I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more.
+
+�I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of
+
+utter and stupid despair. My protectors had departed and had broken
+
+the only link that held me to the world. For the first time the
+
+feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to
+
+control them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I
+
+bent my mind towards injury and death. When I thought of my friends,
+
+of the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the
+
+exquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished and a gush of
+
+tears somewhat soothed me. But again when I reflected that they had
+
+spurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to
+
+injure anything human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects. As
+
+night advanced, I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage,
+
+and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden,
+
+I waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my
+
+operations.
+
+�As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly
+
+dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast tore
+
+along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my
+
+spirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection. I lighted the
+
+dry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage,
+
+my eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon
+
+nearly touched. A part of its orb was at length hid, and I waved my
+
+brand; it sank, and with a loud scream I fired the straw, and heath,
+
+and bushes, which I had collected. The wind fanned the fire, and the
+
+cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to it and
+
+licked it with their forked and destroying tongues.
+
+�As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of
+
+the habitation, I quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods.
+
+�And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps? I
+
+resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated
+
+and despised, every country must be equally horrible. At length the
+
+thought of you crossed my mind. I learned from your papers that you
+
+were my father, my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness
+
+than to him who had given me life? Among the lessons that Felix had
+
+bestowed upon Safie, geography had not been omitted; I had learned from
+
+these the relative situations of the different countries of the earth.
+
+You had mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town, and towards
+
+this place I resolved to proceed.
+
+�But how was I to direct myself? I knew that I must travel in a
+
+southwesterly direction to reach my destination, but the sun was my
+
+only guide. I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass
+
+through, nor could I ask information from a single human being; but I
+
+did not despair. From you only could I hope for succour, although
+
+towards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred. Unfeeling,
+
+heartless creator! You had endowed me with perceptions and passions
+
+and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind.
+
+But on you only had I any claim for pity and redress, and from you I
+
+determined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain from
+
+any other being that wore the human form.
+
+�My travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense. It was
+
+late in autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided.
+
+I travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a
+
+human being. Nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless;
+
+rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface
+
+of the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter. Oh,
+
+earth! How often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being! The
+
+mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall
+
+and bitterness. The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more
+
+deeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart. Snow
+
+fell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not. A few incidents
+
+now and then directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I
+
+often wandered wide from my path. The agony of my feelings allowed me
+
+no respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could
+
+not extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived
+
+on the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth
+
+and the earth again began to look green, confirmed in an especial
+
+manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings.
+
+�I generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was
+
+secured by night from the view of man. One morning, however, finding
+
+that my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey
+
+after the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring,
+
+cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of
+
+the air. I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long
+
+appeared dead, revive within me. Half surprised by the novelty of
+
+these sensations, I allowed myself to be borne away by them, and
+
+forgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy. Soft tears
+
+again bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with
+
+thankfulness towards the blessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon me.
+
+�I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its
+
+boundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many
+
+of the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring.
+
+Here I paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard
+
+the sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade
+
+of a cypress. I was scarcely hid when a young girl came running
+
+towards the spot where I was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from
+
+someone in sport. She continued her course along the precipitous sides
+
+of the river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the
+
+rapid stream. I rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour,
+
+from the force of the current, saved her and dragged her to shore. She
+
+was senseless, and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restore
+
+animation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic,
+
+who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled. On
+
+seeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms,
+
+hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood. I followed speedily, I
+
+hardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun,
+
+which he carried, at my body and fired. I sank to the ground, and my
+
+injurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood.
+
+�This was then the reward of my benevolence! I had saved a human being
+
+from destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable
+
+pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone. The feelings of
+
+kindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments
+
+before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth. Inflamed by
+
+pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind. But the
+
+agony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I fainted.
+
+�For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to
+
+cure the wound which I had received. The ball had entered my shoulder,
+
+and I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any
+
+rate I had no means of extracting it. My sufferings were augmented
+
+also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their
+
+infliction. My daily vows rose for revenge�a deep and deadly revenge,
+
+such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had
+
+endured.
+
+�After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey. The
+
+labours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or
+
+gentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery which insulted my
+
+desolate state and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for
+
+the enjoyment of pleasure.
+
+�But my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time I
+
+reached the environs of Geneva.
+
+�It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among
+
+the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I should apply
+
+to you. I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to
+
+enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting
+
+behind the stupendous mountains of Jura.
+
+�At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection,
+
+which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came
+
+running into the recess I had chosen, with all the sportiveness of
+
+infancy. Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me that this
+
+little creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have
+
+imbibed a horror of deformity. If, therefore, I could seize him and
+
+educate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in
+
+this peopled earth.
+
+�Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed and drew him
+
+towards me. As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before
+
+his eyes and uttered a shrill scream; I drew his hand forcibly from his
+
+face and said, �Child, what is the meaning of this? I do not intend to
+
+hurt you; listen to me.�
+
+�He struggled violently. �Let me go,� he cried;
+
+�monster! Ugly wretch! You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces. You
+
+are an ogre. Let me go, or I will tell my papa.�
+
+��Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.�
+
+��Hideous monster! Let me go. My papa is a syndic�he is M.
+
+Frankenstein�he will punish you. You dare not keep me.�
+
+��Frankenstein! you belong then to my enemy�to him towards whom I have
+
+sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.�
+
+�The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried
+
+despair to my heart; I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a
+
+moment he lay dead at my feet.
+
+�I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish
+
+triumph; clapping my hands, I exclaimed, �I too can create desolation;
+
+my enemy is not invulnerable; this death will carry despair to him, and
+
+a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him.�
+
+�As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his
+
+breast. I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman. In spite
+
+of my malignity, it softened and attracted me. For a few moments I
+
+gazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her
+
+lovely lips; but presently my rage returned; I remembered that I was
+
+for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could
+
+bestow and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would, in
+
+regarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one
+
+expressive of disgust and affright.
+
+�Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage? I only
+
+wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in
+
+exclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind and perish in the
+
+attempt to destroy them.
+
+�While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had
+
+committed the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I
+
+entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty. A woman was
+
+sleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her
+
+whose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the
+
+loveliness of youth and health. Here, I thought, is one of those whose
+
+joy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me. And then I bent over
+
+her and whispered, �Awake, fairest, thy lover is near�he who would
+
+give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my
+
+beloved, awake!�
+
+�The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me. Should she
+
+indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer? Thus
+
+would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me.
+
+The thought was madness; it stirred the fiend within me�not I, but
+
+she, shall suffer; the murder I have committed because I am for ever
+
+robbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone. The crime had
+
+its source in her; be hers the punishment! Thanks to the lessons of
+
+Felix and the sanguinary laws of man, I had learned now to work
+
+mischief. I bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of
+
+the folds of her dress. She moved again, and I fled.
+
+�For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place,
+
+sometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and
+
+its miseries for ever. At length I wandered towards these mountains,
+
+and have ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning
+
+passion which you alone can gratify. We may not part until you have
+
+promised to comply with my requisition. I am alone and miserable; man
+
+will not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself
+
+would not deny herself to me. My companion must be of the same species
+
+and have the same defects. This being you must create.�

+Chapter 20
+
+I sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was just
+
+rising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment, and I
+
+remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my
+
+labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention
+
+to it. As I sat, a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to
+
+consider the effects of what I was now doing. Three years before, I was
+
+engaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled
+
+barbarity had desolated my heart and filled it for ever with the bitterest
+
+remorse. I was now about to form another being of whose dispositions I was
+
+alike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her
+
+mate and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness. He had
+
+sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts, but she
+
+had not; and she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and
+
+reasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before her
+
+creation. They might even hate each other; the creature who already lived
+
+loathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence
+
+for it when it came before his eyes in the female form? She also might turn
+
+with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him,
+
+and he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of being
+
+deserted by one of his own species.
+
+Even if they were to leave Europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world,
+
+yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the d�mon
+
+thirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon
+
+the earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a
+
+condition precarious and full of terror. Had I right, for my own benefit,
+
+to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations? I had before been moved
+
+by the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck senseless by
+
+his fiendish threats; but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my
+
+promise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me
+
+as their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at
+
+the price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race.
+
+I trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, I saw by
+
+the light of the moon the d�mon at the casement. A ghastly grin
+
+wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task
+
+which he had allotted to me. Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he
+
+had loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide
+
+and desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the
+
+fulfilment of my promise.
+
+As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of
+
+malice and treachery. I thought with a sensation of madness on my
+
+promise of creating another like to him, and trembling with passion,
+
+tore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged. The wretch saw me
+
+destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for
+
+happiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.
+
+I left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own
+
+heart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I
+
+sought my own apartment. I was alone; none were near me to dissipate
+
+the gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most
+
+terrible reveries.
+
+Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea;
+
+it was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature
+
+reposed under the eye of the quiet moon. A few fishing vessels alone
+
+specked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound
+
+of voices as the fishermen called to one another. I felt the silence,
+
+although I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear
+
+was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a
+
+person landed close to my house.
+
+In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one
+
+endeavoured to open it softly. I trembled from head to foot; I felt a
+
+presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who
+
+dwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensation
+
+of helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain
+
+endeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot.
+
+Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door
+
+opened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared. Shutting the door, he
+
+approached me and said in a smothered voice,
+
+�You have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you
+
+intend? Do you dare to break your promise? I have endured toil and misery;
+
+I left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, among
+
+its willow islands and over the summits of its hills. I have dwelt many
+
+months in the heaths of England and among the deserts of Scotland. I have
+
+endured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy my
+
+hopes?�
+
+�Begone! I do break my promise; never will I create another like
+
+yourself, equal in deformity and wickedness.�
+
+�Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself
+
+unworthy of my condescension. Remember that I have power; you believe
+
+yourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of
+
+day will be hateful to you. You are my creator, but I am your master;
+
+obey!�
+
+�The hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your power is
+
+arrived. Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but
+
+they confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in
+
+vice. Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a d�mon whose
+
+delight is in death and wretchedness? Begone! I am firm, and your
+
+words will only exasperate my rage.�
+
+The monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the
+
+impotence of anger. �Shall each man,� cried he, �find a
+
+wife for his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone? I had
+
+feelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn.
+
+Man! You may hate, but beware! Your hours will pass in dread and misery,
+
+and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for
+
+ever. Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of my
+
+wretchedness? You can blast my other passions, but revenge
+
+remains�revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food! I may die, but
+
+first you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your
+
+misery. Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful. I will watch with
+
+the wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom. Man, you shall
+
+repent of the injuries you inflict.�
+
+�Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice.
+
+I have declared my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend
+
+beneath words. Leave me; I am inexorable.�
+
+�It is well. I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your
+
+wedding-night.�
+
+I started forward and exclaimed, �Villain! Before you sign my
+
+death-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe.�
+
+I would have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house with
+
+precipitation. In a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shot
+
+across the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the
+
+waves.
+
+All was again silent, but his words rang in my ears. I burned with rage to
+
+pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean. I
+
+walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination
+
+conjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me. Why had I not
+
+followed him and closed with him in mortal strife? But I had suffered him
+
+to depart, and he had directed his course towards the mainland. I shuddered
+
+to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge.
+
+And then I thought again of his words��_I will be with you on
+
+your wedding-night._� That, then, was the period fixed for the
+
+fulfilment of my destiny. In that hour I should die and at once satisfy and
+
+extinguish his malice. The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I
+
+thought of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow, when she
+
+should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her, tears, the first I
+
+had shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall
+
+before my enemy without a bitter struggle.
+
+The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became
+
+calmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into
+
+the depths of despair. I left the house, the horrid scene of the last
+
+night�s contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I
+
+almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow
+
+creatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me. I
+
+desired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is true,
+
+but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery. If I returned, it was to
+
+be sacrificed or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a
+
+d�mon whom I had myself created.
+
+I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it
+
+loved and miserable in the separation. When it became noon, and the
+
+sun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep
+
+sleep. I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves
+
+were agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery. The sleep
+
+into which I now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as
+
+if I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to
+
+reflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the
+
+words of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appeared
+
+like a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality.
+
+The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my
+
+appetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a
+
+fishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet;
+
+it contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me to
+
+join him. He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where
+
+he was, that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired
+
+his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his
+
+Indian enterprise. He could not any longer delay his departure; but as
+
+his journey to London might be followed, even sooner than he now
+
+conjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much of
+
+my society on him as I could spare. He besought me, therefore, to
+
+leave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we might proceed
+
+southwards together. This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and
+
+I determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days.
+
+Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered
+
+to reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose I
+
+must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must
+
+handle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me. The next
+
+morning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door
+
+of my laboratory. The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had
+
+destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had
+
+mangled the living flesh of a human being. I paused to collect myself and
+
+then entered the chamber. With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments
+
+out of the room, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my
+
+work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordingly
+
+put them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them
+
+up, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the
+
+meantime I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my
+
+chemical apparatus.
+
+Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place
+
+in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the d�mon. I had
+
+before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with
+
+whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film
+
+had been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw
+
+clearly. The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur
+
+to me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not
+
+reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it. I had resolved in
+
+my own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made
+
+would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and I
+
+banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different
+
+conclusion.
+
+Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my
+
+basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore.
+
+The scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land,
+
+but I sailed away from them. I felt as if I was about the commission of a
+
+dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my
+
+fellow creatures. At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was
+
+suddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of
+
+darkness and cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound
+
+as it sank and then sailed away from the spot. The sky became clouded, but
+
+the air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then
+
+rising. But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations
+
+that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a
+
+direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. Clouds hid the
+
+moon, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat as its
+
+keel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I
+
+slept soundly.
+
+I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I
+
+found that the sun had already mounted considerably. The wind was high, and
+
+the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. I found
+
+that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from
+
+which I had embarked. I endeavoured to change my course but quickly found
+
+that if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with
+
+water. Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind. I
+
+confess that I felt a few sensations of terror. I had no compass with me
+
+and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the
+
+world that the sun was of little benefit to me. I might be driven into the
+
+wide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in
+
+the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me. I had already
+
+been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to
+
+my other sufferings. I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds
+
+that flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; I looked upon the
+
+sea; it was to be my grave. �Fiend,� I exclaimed, �your
+
+task is already fulfilled!� I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and
+
+of Clerval�all left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his
+
+sanguinary and merciless passions. This idea plunged me into a reverie so
+
+despairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point of
+
+closing before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it.
+
+Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the
+
+horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became
+
+free from breakers. But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick
+
+and hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high
+
+land towards the south.
+
+Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured
+
+for several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of
+
+warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.
+
+How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have
+
+of life even in the excess of misery! I constructed another sail with a
+
+part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land. It had a
+
+wild and rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily perceived
+
+the traces of cultivation. I saw vessels near the shore and found myself
+
+suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man. I
+
+carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at
+
+length saw issuing from behind a small promontory. As I was in a state of
+
+extreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place
+
+where I could most easily procure nourishment. Fortunately I had money with
+
+me. As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good
+
+harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected
+
+escape.
+
+As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several
+
+people crowded towards the spot. They seemed much surprised at my
+
+appearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered
+
+together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me
+
+a slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that they
+
+spoke English, and I therefore addressed them in that language. �My
+
+good friends,� said I, �will you be so kind as to tell me the name of
+
+this town and inform me where I am?�
+
+�You will know that soon enough,� replied a man with a hoarse voice.
+
+�Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste,
+
+but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you.�
+
+I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a
+
+stranger, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and
+
+angry countenances of his companions. �Why do you answer me so
+
+roughly?� I replied. �Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to
+
+receive strangers so inhospitably.�
+
+�I do not know,� said the man, �what the custom of the
+
+English may be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains.�
+
+While this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly
+
+increase. Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which
+
+annoyed and in some degree alarmed me. I inquired the way to the inn, but
+
+no one replied. I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the
+
+crowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man
+
+approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, �Come, sir, you must
+
+follow me to Mr. Kirwin�s to give an account of yourself.�
+
+�Who is Mr. Kirwin? Why am I to give an account of myself? Is not
+
+this a free country?�
+
+�Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks. Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate,
+
+and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was
+
+found murdered here last night.�
+
+This answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself. I was innocent;
+
+that could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my conductor in silence
+
+and was led to one of the best houses in the town. I was ready to sink from
+
+fatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic
+
+to rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into
+
+apprehension or conscious guilt. Little did I then expect the calamity that
+
+was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair
+
+all fear of ignominy or death.
+
+I must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of
+
+the frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to my
+
+recollection.

+Letter 1
+
+_To Mrs. Saville, England._
+
+St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17�.
+
+You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the
+
+commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil
+
+forebodings. I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure
+
+my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success
+
+of my undertaking.
+
+I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of
+
+Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which
+
+braces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this
+
+feeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards
+
+which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.
+
+Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent
+
+and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of
+
+frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the
+
+region of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever
+
+visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a
+
+perpetual splendour. There�for with your leave, my sister, I will put
+
+some trust in preceding navigators�there snow and frost are banished;
+
+and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in
+
+wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable
+
+globe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the
+
+phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered
+
+solitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I
+
+may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may
+
+regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this
+
+voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I
+
+shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world
+
+never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by
+
+the foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to
+
+conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this
+
+laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little
+
+boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his
+
+native river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you
+
+cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all
+
+mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole
+
+to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are
+
+requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at
+
+all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.
+
+These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my
+
+letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me
+
+to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as
+
+a steady purpose�a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual
+
+eye. This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I
+
+have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have
+
+been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean
+
+through the seas which surround the pole. You may remember that a
+
+history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the
+
+whole of our good Uncle Thomas� library. My education was neglected,
+
+yet I was passionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study
+
+day and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which
+
+I had felt, as a child, on learning that my father�s dying injunction
+
+had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.
+
+These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets
+
+whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven. I also
+
+became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation;
+
+I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the
+
+names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated. You are well
+
+acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment.
+
+But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my
+
+thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.
+
+Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I
+
+can, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this
+
+great enterprise. I commenced by inuring my body to hardship. I
+
+accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea;
+
+I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often
+
+worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my
+
+nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those
+
+branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive
+
+the greatest practical advantage. Twice I actually hired myself as an
+
+under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I
+
+must own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second
+
+dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest
+
+earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.
+
+And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?
+
+My life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to
+
+every enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging
+
+voice would answer in the affirmative! My courage and my resolution is
+
+firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. I am
+
+about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which
+
+will demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits
+
+of others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.
+
+This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly
+
+quickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in
+
+my opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach. The
+
+cold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs�a dress which I have
+
+already adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the
+
+deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise
+
+prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins. I have no
+
+ambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and
+
+Archangel.
+
+I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my
+
+intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the
+
+insurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary
+
+among those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend to
+
+sail until the month of June; and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how
+
+can I answer this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years,
+
+will pass before you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon,
+
+or never.
+
+Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down blessings on you,
+
+and save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your
+
+love and kindness.
+
+Your affectionate brother,
+
+R. Walton

+Chapter 7
+
+On my return, I found the following letter from my father:�
+
+�My dear Victor,
+
+�You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of
+
+your return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few
+
+lines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you. But
+
+that would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it. What would be
+
+your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to
+
+behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness? And how, Victor, can
+
+I relate our misfortune? Absence cannot have rendered you callous to
+
+our joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent
+
+son? I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is
+
+impossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words
+
+which are to convey to you the horrible tidings.
+
+�William is dead!�that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed
+
+my heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay! Victor, he is murdered!
+
+�I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the
+
+circumstances of the transaction.
+
+�Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to
+
+walk in Plainpalais. The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged
+
+our walk farther than usual. It was already dusk before we thought of
+
+returning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone
+
+on before, were not to be found. We accordingly rested on a seat until
+
+they should return. Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen
+
+his brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that William
+
+had run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and
+
+afterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return.
+
+�This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him
+
+until night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have
+
+returned to the house. He was not there. We returned again, with
+
+torches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had
+
+lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night;
+
+Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish. About five in the morning I
+
+discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming and
+
+active in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless; the
+
+print of the murder�s finger was on his neck.
+
+�He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my
+
+countenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth. She was very earnest to
+
+see the corpse. At first I attempted to prevent her but she persisted,
+
+and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the
+
+victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, �O God! I have murdered my
+
+darling child!�
+
+�She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When she again
+
+lived, it was only to weep and sigh. She told me, that that same
+
+evening William had teased her to let him wear a very valuable
+
+miniature that she possessed of your mother. This picture is gone, and
+
+was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed. We
+
+have no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover him
+
+are unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved William!
+
+�Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth. She weeps
+
+continually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death;
+
+her words pierce my heart. We are all unhappy; but will not that be an
+
+additional motive for you, my son, to return and be our comforter?
+
+Your dear mother! Alas, Victor! I now say, Thank God she did not live
+
+to witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!
+
+�Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin,
+
+but with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of
+
+festering, the wounds of our minds. Enter the house of mourning, my
+
+friend, but with kindness and affection for those who love you, and not
+
+with hatred for your enemies.
+
+�Your affectionate and afflicted father,
+
+�Alphonse Frankenstein.
+
+�Geneva, May 12th, 17�.�
+
+Clerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was
+
+surprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy I at first
+
+expressed on receiving new from my friends. I threw the letter on the
+
+table, and covered my face with my hands.
+
+�My dear Frankenstein,� exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me
+
+weep with bitterness, �are you always to be unhappy? My dear friend,
+
+what has happened?�
+
+I motioned him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the
+
+room in the extremest agitation. Tears also gushed from the eyes of
+
+Clerval, as he read the account of my misfortune.
+
+�I can offer you no consolation, my friend,� said he;
+
+�your disaster is irreparable. What do you intend to do?�
+
+�To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses.�
+
+During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation;
+
+he could only express his heartfelt sympathy. �Poor William!� said he,
+
+�dear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother! Who that had
+
+seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his
+
+untimely loss! To die so miserably; to feel the murderer�s grasp! How
+
+much more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence! Poor little
+
+fellow! one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep, but
+
+he is at rest. The pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for ever.
+
+A sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain. He can no longer
+
+be a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable
+
+survivors.�
+
+Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words
+
+impressed themselves on my mind and I remembered them afterwards in
+
+solitude. But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a
+
+cabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend.
+
+My journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed
+
+to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when I
+
+drew near my native town, I slackened my progress. I could hardly sustain
+
+the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. I passed through
+
+scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years.
+
+How altered every thing might be during that time! One sudden and
+
+desolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances
+
+might have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although they were
+
+done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive. Fear overcame me; I
+
+dared no advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble,
+
+although I was unable to define them.
+
+I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind. I
+
+contemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the
+
+snowy mountains, �the palaces of nature,� were not changed. By
+
+degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journey
+
+towards Geneva.
+
+The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I
+
+approached my native town. I discovered more distinctly the black
+
+sides of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Blanc. I wept like a
+
+child. �Dear mountains! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome your
+
+wanderer? Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and
+
+placid. Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?�
+
+I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on
+
+these preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative
+
+happiness, and I think of them with pleasure. My country, my beloved
+
+country! who but a native can tell the delight I took in again
+
+beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely
+
+lake!
+
+Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. Night also
+
+closed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still
+
+more gloomily. The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I
+
+foresaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human
+
+beings. Alas! I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single
+
+circumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not
+
+conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.
+
+It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates
+
+of the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at
+
+Secheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city. The sky
+
+was serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot
+
+where my poor William had been murdered. As I could not pass through the
+
+town, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais.
+
+During this short voyage I saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont
+
+Blanc in the most beautiful figures. The storm appeared to approach
+
+rapidly, and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its
+
+progress. It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain
+
+coming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.
+
+I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm
+
+increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash
+
+over my head. It was echoed from Sal�ve, the Juras, and the Alps of
+
+Savoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the
+
+lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant
+
+every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself
+
+from the preceding flash. The storm, as is often the case in
+
+Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The
+
+most violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the
+
+lake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of
+
+Cop�t. Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another
+
+darkened and sometimes disclosed the M�le, a peaked mountain to the
+
+east of the lake.
+
+While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with
+
+a hasty step. This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my
+
+hands, and exclaimed aloud, �William, dear angel! this is thy
+
+funeral, this thy dirge!� As I said these words, I perceived in the
+
+gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood
+
+fixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning
+
+illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its
+
+gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs
+
+to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy
+
+d�mon, to whom I had given life. What did he there? Could he be (I
+
+shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? No sooner did that
+
+idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth
+
+chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support. The figure
+
+passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. Nothing in human shape could
+
+have destroyed the fair child. _He_ was the murderer! I could not
+
+doubt it. The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the
+
+fact. I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for
+
+another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly
+
+perpendicular ascent of Mont Sal�ve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the
+
+south. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.
+
+I remained motionless. The thunder ceased; but the rain still
+
+continued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. I
+
+revolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget:
+
+the whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of
+
+the works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure. Two years had
+
+now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and
+
+was this his first crime? Alas! I had turned loose into the world a
+
+depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not
+
+murdered my brother?
+
+No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the
+
+night, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did not
+
+feel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in
+
+scenes of evil and despair. I considered the being whom I had cast
+
+among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes
+
+of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light
+
+of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced
+
+to destroy all that was dear to me.
+
+Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town. The gates were
+
+open, and I hastened to my father�s house. My first thought was to
+
+discover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be
+
+made. But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell. A
+
+being whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at
+
+midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain. I
+
+remembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at
+
+the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of
+
+delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable. I well knew that
+
+if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have
+
+looked upon it as the ravings of insanity. Besides, the strange nature
+
+of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited
+
+as to persuade my relatives to commence it. And then of what use would
+
+be pursuit? Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the
+
+overhanging sides of Mont Sal�ve? These reflections determined me, and
+
+I resolved to remain silent.
+
+It was about five in the morning when I entered my father�s house. I
+
+told the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library
+
+to attend their usual hour of rising.
+
+Six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and I
+
+stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my
+
+departure for Ingolstadt. Beloved and venerable parent! He still remained
+
+to me. I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the
+
+mantel-piece. It was an historical subject, painted at my father�s
+
+desire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling
+
+by the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale;
+
+but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the
+
+sentiment of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my
+
+tears flowed when I looked upon it. While I was thus engaged, Ernest
+
+entered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me:
+
+�Welcome, my dearest Victor,� said he. �Ah! I wish you
+
+had come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and
+
+delighted. You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can
+
+alleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seems
+
+sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor
+
+Elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.�Poor
+
+William! he was our darling and our pride!�
+
+Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother�s eyes; a sense of mortal
+
+agony crept over my frame. Before, I had only imagined the
+
+wretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and
+
+a not less terrible, disaster. I tried to calm Ernest; I enquired more
+
+minutely concerning my father, and here I named my cousin.
+
+�She most of all,� said Ernest, �requires consolation; she accused
+
+herself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her
+
+very wretched. But since the murderer has been discovered��
+
+�The murderer discovered! Good God! how can that be? who could attempt
+
+to pursue him? It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the
+
+winds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw. I saw him too; he
+
+was free last night!�
+
+�I do not know what you mean,� replied my brother, in accents of
+
+wonder, �but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery. No
+
+one would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not be
+
+convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence. Indeed, who would credit
+
+that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family,
+
+could suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?�
+
+�Justine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the accused? But it is
+
+wrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?�
+
+�No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have
+
+almost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so
+
+confused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear,
+
+leaves no hope for doubt. But she will be tried today, and you will
+
+then hear all.�
+
+He then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William
+
+had been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her
+
+bed for several days. During this interval, one of the servants,
+
+happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the
+
+murder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which
+
+had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer. The servant
+
+instantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to
+
+any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition,
+
+Justine was apprehended. On being charged with the fact, the poor girl
+
+confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of
+
+manner.
+
+This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied
+
+earnestly, �You are all mistaken; I know the murderer. Justine, poor,
+
+good Justine, is innocent.�
+
+At that instant my father entered. I saw unhappiness deeply impressed
+
+on his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and,
+
+after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced
+
+some other topic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed,
+
+�Good God, papa! Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of
+
+poor William.�
+
+�We do also, unfortunately,� replied my father, �for indeed I had
+
+rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much
+
+depravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly.�
+
+�My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.�
+
+�If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. She is to be
+
+tried today, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.�
+
+This speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own mind that
+
+Justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder. I
+
+had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be
+
+brought forward strong enough to convict her. My tale was not one to
+
+announce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as
+
+madness by the vulgar. Did any one indeed exist, except I, the
+
+creator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the
+
+existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance
+
+which I had let loose upon the world?
+
+We were soon joined by Elizabeth. Time had altered her since I last
+
+beheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of
+
+her childish years. There was the same candour, the same vivacity, but
+
+it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect.
+
+She welcomed me with the greatest affection. �Your arrival, my dear
+
+cousin,� said she, �fills me with hope. You perhaps will find some
+
+means to justify my poor guiltless Justine. Alas! who is safe, if she
+
+be convicted of crime? I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do
+
+upon my own. Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only
+
+lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely
+
+love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate. If she is condemned, I
+
+never shall know joy more. But she will not, I am sure she will not;
+
+and then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little
+
+William.�
+
+�She is innocent, my Elizabeth,� said I, �and that shall
+
+be proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance
+
+of her acquittal.�
+
+�How kind and generous you are! every one else believes in her guilt,
+
+and that made me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible: and to
+
+see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me
+
+hopeless and despairing.� She wept.
+
+�Dearest niece,� said my father, �dry your tears. If she
+
+is, as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the
+
+activity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of
+
+partiality.�

+Frankenstein;or, the Modern Prometheusby Mary Wollstonecraft (Godwin) ShelleyCONTENTSLetter 1Letter 2Letter 3Letter 4Chapter 1Chapter 2Chapter 3Chapter 4Chapter 5Chapter 6Chapter 7Chapter 8Chapter 9Chapter 10Chapter 11Chapter 12Chapter 13Chapter 14Chapter 15Chapter 16Chapter 17Chapter 18Chapter 19Chapter 20Chapter 21Chapter 22Chapter 23Chapter 24Letter 1_To Mrs. Saville, England._St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17—.You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied thecommencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evilforebodings. I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assuremy dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the successof my undertaking.I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets ofPetersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, whichbraces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand thisfeeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towardswhich I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more ferventand vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat offrost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as theregion of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for evervisible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing aperpetual splendour. There—for with your leave, my sister, I will putsome trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished;and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing inwonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitableglobe. Its productions and features may be without example, as thephenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscoveredsolitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? Imay there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and mayregulate a thousand celestial observations that require only thisvoyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. Ishall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the worldnever before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted bythe foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient toconquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence thislaborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a littleboat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up hisnative river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, youcannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on allmankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the poleto those countries, to reach which at present so many months arerequisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if atall possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began myletter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates meto heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind asa steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectualeye. This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. Ihave read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which havebeen made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Oceanthrough the seas which surround the pole. You may remember that ahistory of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed thewhole of our good Uncle Thomas’ library. My education was neglected,yet I was passionately fond of reading. These volumes were my studyday and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret whichI had felt, as a child, on learning that my father’s dying injunctionhad forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poetswhose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven. I alsobecame a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation;I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where thenames of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated. You are wellacquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment.But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and mythoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. Ican, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to thisgreat enterprise. I commenced by inuring my body to hardship. Iaccompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea;I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I oftenworked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted mynights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and thosebranches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derivethe greatest practical advantage. Twice I actually hired myself as anunder-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. Imust own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the seconddignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatestearnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?My life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory toevery enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some encouragingvoice would answer in the affirmative! My courage and my resolution isfirm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. I amabout to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of whichwill demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spiritsof others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They flyquickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, inmy opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach. Thecold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs—a dress which I havealready adopted, for there is a great difference between walking thedeck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exerciseprevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins. I have noambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh andArchangel.I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and myintention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying theinsurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessaryamong those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend tosail until the month of June; and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, howcan I answer this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years,will pass before you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon,or never.Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down blessings on you,and save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all yourlove and kindness.Your affectionate brother,R. WaltonLetter 2_To Mrs. Saville, England._Archangel, 28th March, 17—.How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow!Yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired avessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I havealready engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainlypossessed of dauntless courage.But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and theabsence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have nofriend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, therewill be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, noone will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughtsto paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication offeeling. I desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me, whoseeyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but Ibitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yetcourageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whosetastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such afriend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in executionand too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to methat I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wildon a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas’ books of voyages.At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our owncountry; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive itsmost important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived thenecessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my nativecountry. Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than manyschoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more and that mydaydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painterscall it) _keeping;_ and I greatly need a friend who would have senseenough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me toendeavour to regulate my mind.Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on thewide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yetsome feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in theserugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courageand enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrasemore characteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is anEnglishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices,unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments ofhumanity. I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel;finding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assistin my enterprise.The master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in theship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. Thiscircumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, mademe very desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best yearsspent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined thegroundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste tothe usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to benecessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindlinessof heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I feltmyself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I heardof him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him thehappiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story. Some years ago he loveda young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerablesum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. He sawhis mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed intears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her,confessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor,and that her father would never consent to the union. My generous friendreassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover,instantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with hismoney, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but hebestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of hisprize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the youngwoman’s father to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the oldman decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who,when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returneduntil he heard that his former mistress was married according to herinclinations. “What a noble fellow!” you will exclaim. He isso; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kindof ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conductthe more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy whichotherwise he would command.Yet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I canconceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I amwavering in my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyageis only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. Thewinter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and itis considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sailsooner than I expected. I shall do nothing rashly: you know mesufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever thesafety of others is committed to my care.I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of myundertaking. It is impossible to communicate to you a conception ofthe trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with whichI am preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions, to “theland of mist and snow,” but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do notbe alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn andwoeful as the “Ancient Mariner.” You will smile at my allusion, but Iwill disclose a secret. I have often attributed my attachment to, mypassionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to thatproduction of the most imaginative of modern poets. There is somethingat work in my soul which I do not understand. I am practicallyindustrious—painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance andlabour—but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a beliefin the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me outof the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisitedregions I am about to explore.But to return to dearer considerations. Shall I meet you again, afterhaving traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape ofAfrica or America? I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear tolook on the reverse of the picture. Continue for the present to write tome by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions whenI need them most to support my spirits. I love you very tenderly. Remember me with affection, should you never hear from me again.Your affectionate brother,Robert WaltonLetter 3_To Mrs. Saville, England._July 7th, 17—.My dear Sister,I write a few lines in haste to say that I am safe—and well advancedon my voyage. This letter will reach England by a merchantman now onits homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may notsee my native land, perhaps, for many years. I am, however, in goodspirits: my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose, nor do thefloating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangersof the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them. Wehave already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height ofsummer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales,which blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desireto attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had notexpected.No incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in aletter. One or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak areaccidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record, andI shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage.Adieu, my dear Margaret. Be assured that for my own sake, as well asyours, I will not rashly encounter danger. I will be cool,persevering, and prudent.But success _shall_ crown my endeavours. Wherefore not? Thus far Ihave gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas, the very starsthemselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph. Why notstill proceed over the untamed yet obedient element? What can stop thedetermined heart and resolved will of man?My swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus. But I mustfinish. Heaven bless my beloved sister!R.W.Letter 4_To Mrs. Saville, England._August 5th, 17—.So strange an accident has happened to us that I cannot forbearrecording it, although it is very probable that you will see me beforethese papers can come into your possession.Last Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closedin the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in whichshe floated. Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as wewere compassed round by a very thick fog. We accordingly lay to,hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.About two o’clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched outin every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed tohave no end. Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began togrow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenlyattracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our ownsituation. We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn bydogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; abeing which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature,sat in the sledge and guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progressof the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among thedistant inequalities of the ice.This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as we believed,many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote thatit was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, byice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with thegreatest attention.About two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and beforenight the ice broke and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until themorning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses whichfloat about after the breaking up of the ice. I profited of this time torest for a few hours.In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck andfound all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparentlytalking to someone in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that wehad seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a largefragment of ice. Only one dog remained alive; but there was a humanbeing within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant ofsome undiscovered island, but a European. When I appeared on deck themaster said, “Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perishon the open sea.”On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with aforeign accent. “Before I come on board your vessel,” said he,“will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?”You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressedto me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should havesupposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would nothave exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford. Ireplied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards thenorthern pole.Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board.Good God! Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated forhis safety, your surprise would have been boundless. His limbs werenearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue andsuffering. I never saw a man in so wretched a condition. We attemptedto carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the freshair he fainted. We accordingly brought him back to the deck andrestored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him toswallow a small quantity. As soon as he showed signs of life wewrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of thekitchen stove. By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup,which restored him wonderfully.Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I oftenfeared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding. When hehad in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin andattended on him as much as my duty would permit. I never saw a moreinteresting creature: his eyes have generally an expression ofwildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyoneperforms an act of kindness towards him or does him any the mosttrifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, witha beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled. But heis generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes histeeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.When my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep offthe men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would notallow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of bodyand mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.Once, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the icein so strange a vehicle.His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, andhe replied, “To seek one who fled from me.”“And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?”“Yes.”“Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up wesaw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.”This aroused the stranger’s attention, and he asked a multitude ofquestions concerning the route which the dæmon, as he called him, hadpursued. Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, “I have,doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these goodpeople; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.”“Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me totrouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.”“And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you havebenevolently restored me to life.”Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of theice had destroyed the other sledge. I replied that I could not answerwith any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until nearmidnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safetybefore that time; but of this I could not judge.From this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of thestranger. He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch forthe sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain inthe cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere.I have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instantnotice if any new object should appear in sight.Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to thepresent day. The stranger has gradually improved in health but is verysilent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin.Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are allinterested in him, although they have had very little communicationwith him. For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and hisconstant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion. He musthave been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreckso attractive and amiable.I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friendon the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had beenbroken by misery, I should have been happy to have possessed as the brotherof my heart.I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals,should I have any fresh incidents to record.August 13th, 17—.My affection for my guest increases every day. He excites at once myadmiration and my pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see sonoble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignantgrief? He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, andwhen he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art,yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.He is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck,apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, althoughunhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that heinterests himself deeply in the projects of others. He has frequentlyconversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him withoutdisguise. He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of myeventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had takento secure it. I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use thelanguage of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my souland to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I wouldsacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of myenterprise. One man’s life or death were but a small price to pay forthe acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I shouldacquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race. As I spoke, adark gloom spread over my listener’s countenance. At first Iperceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands beforehis eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears tricklefast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast. Ipaused; at length he spoke, in broken accents: “Unhappy man! Do youshare my madness? Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught? Hear me;let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!”Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but theparoxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakenedpowers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation werenecessary to restore his composure.Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despisehimself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny ofdespair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally. He askedme the history of my earlier years. The tale was quickly told, but itawakened various trains of reflection. I spoke of my desire of finding afriend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind thanhad ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man couldboast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.“I agree with you,” replied the stranger; “we areunfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer thanourselves—such a friend ought to be—do not lend his aid toperfectionate our weak and faulty natures. I once had a friend, the mostnoble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respectingfriendship. You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause fordespair. But I—I have lost everything and cannot begin lifeanew.”As he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settledgrief that touched me to the heart. But he was silent and presentlyretired to his cabin.Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than hedoes the beauties of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every sightafforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power ofelevating his soul from earth. Such a man has a double existence: hemay suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when hehas retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has ahalo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divinewanderer? You would not if you saw him. You have been tutored andrefined by books and retirement from the world, and you are thereforesomewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit toappreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man. Sometimes Ihave endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses thatelevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew. Ibelieve it to be an intuitive discernment, a quick but never-failingpower of judgment, a penetration into the causes of things, unequalledfor clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression and avoice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.August 19th, 17—.Yesterday the stranger said to me, “You may easily perceive, CaptainWalton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. I haddetermined at one time that the memory of these evils should die withme, but you have won me to alter my determination. You seek forknowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that thegratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as minehas been. I do not know that the relation of my disasters will beuseful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the samecourse, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered mewhat I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale, onethat may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console youin case of failure. Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usuallydeemed marvellous. Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I mightfear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many thingswill appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which wouldprovoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powersof nature; nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its seriesinternal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed.”You may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offeredcommunication, yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief bya recital of his misfortunes. I felt the greatest eagerness to hearthe promised narrative, partly from curiosity and partly from a strongdesire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power. I expressedthese feelings in my answer.“I thank you,” he replied, “for your sympathy, but it isuseless; my fate is nearly fulfilled. I wait but for one event, and then Ishall repose in peace. I understand your feeling,” continued he,perceiving that I wished to interrupt him; “but you are mistaken, myfriend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter mydestiny; listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it isdetermined.”He then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when Ishould be at leisure. This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. I haveresolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties, torecord, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related duringthe day. If I should be engaged, I will at least make notes. Thismanuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure; but to me, whoknow him, and who hear it from his own lips—with what interest andsympathy shall I read it in some future day! Even now, as I commence mytask, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on mewith all their melancholy sweetness; I see his thin hand raised inanimation, while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soulwithin. Strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the storm whichembraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it—thus!Chapter 1I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the mostdistinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many yearscounsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several publicsituations with honour and reputation. He was respected by all whoknew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to publicbusiness. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by theaffairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented hismarrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became ahusband and the father of a family.As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannotrefrain from relating them. One of his most intimate friends was amerchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerousmischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of aproud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in povertyand oblivion in the same country where he had formerly beendistinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts,therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with hisdaughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and inwretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship andwas deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conductso little worthy of the affection that united them. He lost no time inendeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to beginthe world again through his credit and assistance.Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was tenmonths before my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery,he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near theReuss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. Beauforthad saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, butit was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and inthe meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in amerchant’s house. The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction;his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure forreflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the endof three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she sawwith despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and thatthere was no other prospect of support. But Caroline Beaufortpossessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to supporther in her adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw andby various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient tosupport life.Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her timewas more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistencedecreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leavingher an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her, and she kneltby Beaufort’s coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered thechamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, whocommitted herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend heconducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of arelation. Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, butthis circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devotedaffection. There was a sense of justice in my father’s upright mindwhich rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to lovestrongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from thelate-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to seta greater value on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude andworship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from thedoting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for hervirtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensingher for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible graceto his behaviour to her. Everything was made to yield to her wishesand her convenience. He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic issheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround herwith all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft andbenevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hithertoconstant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through. Duringthe two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father hadgradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately aftertheir union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the changeof scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders,as a restorative for her weakened frame.From Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was bornat Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remainedfor several years their only child. Much as they were attached to eachother, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a verymine of love to bestow them upon me. My mother’s tender caresses andmy father’s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are myfirst recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and somethingbetter—their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed onthem by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was intheir hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilledtheir duties towards me. With this deep consciousness of what they owedtowards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spiritof tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while duringevery hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity,and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed butone train of enjoyment to me.For a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desired to have adaughter, but I continued their single offspring. When I was about fiveyears old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, theypassed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como. Their benevolentdisposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor. This, to mymother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, apassion—remembering what she had suffered, and how she had beenrelieved—for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to theafflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a valeattracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the numberof half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worstshape. One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother,accompanied by me, visited this abode. She found a peasant and his wife,hard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal tofive hungry babes. Among these there was one which attracted my mother farabove all the rest. She appeared of a different stock. The four others weredark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair. Herhair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of herclothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head. Her brow wasclear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding ofher face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could beholdher without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent,and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder andadmiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. She wasnot her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother was aGerman and had died on giving her birth. The infant had been placed withthese good people to nurse: they were better off then. They had not beenlong married, and their eldest child was but just born. The father of theircharge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique gloryof Italy—one among the _schiavi ognor frementi,_ who exertedhimself to obtain the liberty of his country. He became the victim of itsweakness. Whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austriawas not known. His property was confiscated; his child became an orphan anda beggar. She continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rudeabode, fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall ofour villa a child fairer than pictured cherub—a creature who seemedto shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighterthan the chamois of the hills. The apparition was soon explained. With hispermission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield theircharge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence had seemeda blessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in povertyand want when Providence afforded her such powerful protection. Theyconsulted their village priest, and the result was that Elizabeth Lavenzabecame the inmate of my parents’ house—my more thansister—the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations andmy pleasures.Everyone loved Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverentialattachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, mypride and my delight. On the evening previous to her being brought tomy home, my mother had said playfully, “I have a pretty present for myVictor—tomorrow he shall have it.” And when, on the morrow, shepresented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childishseriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon Elizabethas mine—mine to protect, love, and cherish. All praises bestowed onher I received as made to a possession of my own. We called each otherfamiliarly by the name of cousin. No word, no expression could bodyforth the kind of relation in which she stood to me—my more thansister, since till death she was to be mine only.Chapter 2We were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference inour ages. I need not say that we were strangers to any species ofdisunion or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, andthe diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew usnearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrateddisposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intenseapplication and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge.She busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets;and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swisshome —the sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons,tempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence ofour Alpine summers—she found ample scope for admiration and delight.While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit themagnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating theircauses. The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine.Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature,gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among theearliest sensations I can remember.On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gaveup entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their nativecountry. We possessed a house in Geneva, and a _campagne_ on Belrive,the eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than aleague from the city. We resided principally in the latter, and thelives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion. It was mytemper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few. I wasindifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but I unitedmyself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them. HenryClerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of singulartalent and fancy. He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger forits own sake. He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance. Hecomposed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment andknightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays and to enter intomasquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes ofRoncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalroustrain who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the handsof the infidels.No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. Myparents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence.We felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according totheir caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delightswhich we enjoyed. When I mingled with other families I distinctlydiscerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assistedthe development of filial love.My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by somelaw in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuitsbut to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all thingsindiscriminately. I confess that neither the structure of languages,nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various statespossessed attractions for me. It was the secrets of heaven and earththat I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance ofthings or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of manthat occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical,or in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moralrelations of things. The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes,and the actions of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream wasto become one among those whose names are recorded in story as thegallant and adventurous benefactors of our species. The saintly soulof Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home.Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance ofher celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us. She wasthe living spirit of love to soften and attract; I might have becomesullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but thatshe was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness. AndClerval—could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval? Yethe might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in hisgenerosity, so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion foradventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness ofbeneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaringambition.I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood,before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions ofextensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self. Besides,in drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those events whichled, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when I wouldaccount to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled mydestiny I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almostforgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrentwhich, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.Natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire,therefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to mypredilection for that science. When I was thirteen years of age we all wenton a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon; the inclemency of theweather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In this house Ichanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa. I opened itwith apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderfulfacts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm. A newlight seemed to dawn upon my mind, and bounding with joy, I communicated mydiscovery to my father. My father looked carelessly at the title page of mybook and said, “Ah! Cornelius Agrippa! My dear Victor, do not wasteyour time upon this; it is sad trash.”If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to methat the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modernsystem of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powersthan the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, whilethose of the former were real and practical, under such circumstances Ishould certainly have thrown Agrippa aside and have contented myimagination, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to myformer studies. It is even possible that the train of my ideas would neverhave received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin. But the cursory glancemy father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he wasacquainted with its contents, and I continued to read with the greatestavidity.When I returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of thisauthor, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read andstudied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to metreasures known to few besides myself. I have described myself as alwayshaving been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets ofnature. In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modernphilosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied.Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child pickingup shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth. Those of hissuccessors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquaintedappeared even to my boy’s apprehensions as tyros engaged in the samepursuit.The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquaintedwith their practical uses. The most learned philosopher knew littlemore. He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortallineaments were still a wonder and a mystery. He might dissect,anatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causesin their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him. Ihad gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keephuman beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly andignorantly I had repined.But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knewmore. I took their word for all that they averred, and I became theirdisciple. It may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenthcentury; but while I followed the routine of education in the schools ofGeneva, I was, to a great degree, self-taught with regard to my favouritestudies. My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with achild’s blindness, added to a student’s thirst for knowledge.Under the guidance of my new preceptors I entered with the greatestdiligence into the search of the philosopher’s stone and the elixirof life; but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention. Wealth was aninferior object, but what glory would attend the discovery if I couldbanish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any buta violent death!Nor were these my only visions. The raising of ghosts or devils was apromise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of whichI most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, Iattributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to awant of skill or fidelity in my instructors. And thus for a time I wasoccupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousandcontradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough ofmultifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childishreasoning, till an accident again changed the current of my ideas.When I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house nearBelrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm. Itadvanced from behind the mountains of Jura, and the thunder burst at oncewith frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. I remained,while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight.As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from anold and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; and sosoon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothingremained but a blasted stump. When we visited it the next morning, we foundthe tree shattered in a singular manner. It was not splintered by theshock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood. I never beheldanything so utterly destroyed.Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws ofelectricity. On this occasion a man of great research in naturalphilosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered onthe explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject ofelectricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me.All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa,Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but bysome fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue myaccustomed studies. It seemed to me as if nothing would or could everbe known. All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grewdespicable. By one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhapsmost subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my formeroccupations, set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformedand abortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for awould-be science which could never even step within the threshold ofreal knowledge. In this mood of mind I betook myself to themathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science asbeing built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration.Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligamentsare we bound to prosperity or ruin. When I look back, it seems to meas if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was theimmediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life—the last effortmade by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was eventhen hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me. Her victory wasannounced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul whichfollowed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormentingstudies. It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil withtheir prosecution, happiness with their disregard.It was a strong effort of the spirit of good, but it was ineffectual.Destiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter andterrible destruction.Chapter 3When I had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that Ishould become a student at the university of Ingolstadt. I hadhitherto attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought itnecessary for the completion of my education that I should be madeacquainted with other customs than those of my native country. Mydeparture was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the dayresolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my lifeoccurred—an omen, as it were, of my future misery.Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she wasin the greatest danger. During her illness many arguments had been urged topersuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her. She had at firstyielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of herfavourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety. Sheattended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignityof the distemper—Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of thisimprudence were fatal to her preserver. On the third day my mothersickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and thelooks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event. On herdeathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not deserther. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself. “Mychildren,” she said, “my firmest hopes of future happiness wereplaced on the prospect of your union. This expectation will now be theconsolation of your father. Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place tomy younger children. Alas! I regret that I am taken from you; and, happyand beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all? But these arenot thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully todeath and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.”She died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death.I need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rentby that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to thesoul, and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance. It is solong before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every dayand whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departedfor ever—that the brightness of a beloved eye can have beenextinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the earcan be hushed, never more to be heard. These are the reflections ofthe first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of theevil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences. Yet from whom hasnot that rude hand rent away some dear connection? And why should Idescribe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel? The time atlength arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; andthe smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed asacrilege, is not banished. My mother was dead, but we had stillduties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course with therest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom thespoiler has not seized.My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events,was now again determined upon. I obtained from my father a respite ofsome weeks. It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose,akin to death, of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick oflife. I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me. I wasunwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me, and aboveall, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled.She indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all.She looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage andzeal. She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to callher uncle and cousins. Never was she so enchanting as at this time,when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us.She forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget.The day of my departure at length arrived. Clerval spent the lastevening with us. He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permithim to accompany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain. Hisfather was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in theaspirations and ambition of his son. Henry deeply felt the misfortuneof being debarred from a liberal education. He said little, but whenhe spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance arestrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable detailsof commerce.We sat late. We could not tear ourselves away from each other norpersuade ourselves to say the word “Farewell!” It was said, and weretired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that theother was deceived; but when at morning’s dawn I descended to thecarriage which was to convey me away, they were all there—my fatheragain to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth torenew her entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the lastfeminine attentions on her playmate and friend.I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged inthe most melancholy reflections. I, who had ever been surrounded byamiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutualpleasure—I was now alone. In the university whither I was going Imust form my own friends and be my own protector. My life had hithertobeen remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invinciblerepugnance to new countenances. I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, andClerval; these were “old familiar faces,” but I believed myselftotally unfitted for the company of strangers. Such were my reflections asI commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. Iardently desired the acquisition of knowledge. I had often, when at home,thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and hadlonged to enter the world and take my station among other human beings. Now my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly torepent.I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during myjourney to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing. At length thehigh white steeple of the town met my eyes. I alighted and wasconducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as I pleased.The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit tosome of the principal professors. Chance—or rather the evilinfluence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over mefrom the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father’sdoor—led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy. Hewas an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science. Heasked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branchesof science appertaining to natural philosophy. I replied carelessly, andpartly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principalauthors I had studied. The professor stared. “Have you,” hesaid, “really spent your time in studying such nonsense?”I replied in the affirmative. “Every minute,” continued M. Krempe withwarmth, “every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterlyand entirely lost. You have burdened your memory with exploded systemsand useless names. Good God! In what desert land have you lived,where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which youhave so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as theyare ancient? I little expected, in this enlightened and scientificage, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dearsir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.”So saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several bookstreating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, anddismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the followingweek he intended to commence a course of lectures upon naturalphilosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellowprofessor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that heomitted.I returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had longconsidered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but Ireturned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in anyshape. M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and arepulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me infavour of his pursuits. In rather a too philosophical and connected astrain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had cometo concerning them in my early years. As a child I had not beencontent with the results promised by the modern professors of naturalscience. With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by myextreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod thesteps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged thediscoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists.Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy.It was very different when the masters of the science soughtimmortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but nowthe scene was changed. The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limititself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest inscience was chiefly founded. I was required to exchange chimeras ofboundless grandeur for realities of little worth.Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of myresidence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becomingacquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my newabode. But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the informationwhich M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures. And although Icould not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliversentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M.Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.Partly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturingroom, which M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was veryunlike his colleague. He appeared about fifty years of age, but with anaspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered histemples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black. His personwas short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard.He began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry andthe various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncingwith fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers. He then tooka cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many ofits elementary terms. After having made a few preparatory experiments, heconcluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which Ishall never forget:“The ancient teachers of this science,” said he,“promised impossibilities and performed nothing. The modern masterspromise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and thatthe elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seemonly made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope orcrucible, have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into the recessesof nature and show how she works in her hiding-places. They ascend into theheavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature ofthe air we breathe. They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers;they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and evenmock the invisible world with its own shadows.”Such were the professor’s words—rather let me say such the words ofthe fate—enounced to destroy me. As he went on I felt as if my soulwere grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys weretouched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord wassounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception,one purpose. So much has been done, exclaimed the soul ofFrankenstein—more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the stepsalready marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, andunfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.I closed not my eyes that night. My internal being was in a state ofinsurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but Ihad no power to produce it. By degrees, after the morning’s dawn,sleep came. I awoke, and my yesternight’s thoughts were as a dream.There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and todevote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess anatural talent. On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit. Hismanners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public,for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which inhis own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness. Igave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I hadgiven to his fellow professor. He heard with attention the littlenarration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of CorneliusAgrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe hadexhibited. He said that “These were men to whose indefatigable zealmodern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of theirknowledge. They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new namesand arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in agreat degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. Thelabours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely everfail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.” Ilistened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumptionor affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed myprejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measuredterms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to hisinstructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would havemade me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intendedlabours. I requested his advice concerning the books I ought toprocure.“I am happy,” said M. Waldman, “to have gained adisciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt ofyour success. Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which thegreatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account thatI have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have notneglected the other branches of science. A man would make but a very sorrychemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone. If yourwish is to become really a man of science and not merely a pettyexperimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of naturalphilosophy, including mathematics.”He then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of hisvarious machines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure andpromising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough inthe science not to derange their mechanism. He also gave me the list ofbooks which I had requested, and I took my leave.Thus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.Chapter 4From this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in themost comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation.I read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination,which modern inquirers have written on these subjects. I attended thelectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of theuniversity, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound senseand real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsivephysiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable. InM. Waldman I found a true friend. His gentleness was never tinged bydogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness andgood nature that banished every idea of pedantry. In a thousand wayshe smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruseinquiries clear and facile to my apprehension. My application was atfirst fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded andsoon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in thelight of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progresswas rapid. My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, andmy proficiency that of the masters. Professor Krempe often asked me,with a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldmanexpressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress. Two yearspassed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but wasengaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which Ihoped to make. None but those who have experienced them can conceiveof the enticements of science. In other studies you go as far asothers have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but ina scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.A mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study mustinfallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, whocontinually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and wassolely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of twoyears I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemicalinstruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at theuniversity. When I had arrived at this point and had become as wellacquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy asdepended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, myresidence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thoughtof returning to my friends and my native town, when an incidenthappened that protracted my stay.One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention wasthe structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued withlife. Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?It was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as amystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becomingacquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain ourinquiries. I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determinedthenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches ofnatural philosophy which relate to physiology. Unless I had beenanimated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to thisstudy would have been irksome and almost intolerable. To examine thecauses of life, we must first have recourse to death. I becameacquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; Imust also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body.In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that mymind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do not everremember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have fearedthe apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, anda churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived oflife, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had becomefood for the worm. Now I was led to examine the cause and progress ofthis decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults andcharnel-houses. My attention was fixed upon every object the mostinsupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. I saw how thefine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption ofdeath succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worminherited the wonders of the eye and brain. I paused, examining andanalysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the changefrom life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of thisdarkness a sudden light broke in upon me—a light so brilliant andwondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensityof the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among somany men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the samescience, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing asecret.Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. The sun does notmore certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm istrue. Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of thediscovery were distinct and probable. After days and nights ofincredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause ofgeneration and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowinganimation upon lifeless matter.The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discoverysoon gave place to delight and rapture. After so much time spent inpainful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was themost gratifying consummation of my toils. But this discovery was sogreat and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had beenprogressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result.What had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creationof the world was now within my grasp. Not that, like a magic scene, itall opened upon me at once: the information I had obtained was of anature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point themtowards the object of my search than to exhibit that object alreadyaccomplished. I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the deadand found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seeminglyineffectual light.I see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyesexpress, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret withwhich I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the endof my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon thatsubject. I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was,to your destruction and infallible misery. Learn from me, if not by myprecepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement ofknowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native townto be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his naturewill allow.When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitateda long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it.Although I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet toprepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies offibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivabledifficulty and labour. I doubted at first whether I should attempt thecreation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but myimagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me todoubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderfulas man. The materials at present within my command hardly appearedadequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I shouldultimately succeed. I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; myoperations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work beimperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takesplace in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my presentattempts would at least lay the foundations of future success. Norcould I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as anyargument of its impracticability. It was with these feelings that Ibegan the creation of a human being. As the minuteness of the partsformed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my firstintention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say,about eight feet in height, and proportionably large. After havingformed this determination and having spent some months in successfullycollecting and arranging my materials, I began.No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, likea hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success. Life and deathappeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, andpour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new species would blessme as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures wouldowe their being to me. No father could claim the gratitude of hischild so completely as I should deserve theirs. Pursuing thesereflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifelessmatter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible)renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertakingwith unremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale with study, and myperson had become emaciated with confinement. Sometimes, on the verybrink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which thenext day or the next hour might realise. One secret which I alonepossessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moongazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathlesseagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places. Who shall conceivethe horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed dampsof the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifelessclay? My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; butthen a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemedto have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit. It wasindeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewedacuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I hadreturned to my old habits. I collected bones from charnel-houses anddisturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the humanframe. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house,and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase,I kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting fromtheir sockets in attending to the details of my employment. Thedissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials;and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation,whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, Ibrought my work near to a conclusion.The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, inone pursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the fieldsbestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriantvintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature. And thesame feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me alsoto forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I hadnot seen for so long a time. I knew my silence disquieted them, and Iwell remembered the words of my father: “I know that while you arepleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shallhear regularly from you. You must pardon me if I regard anyinterruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other dutiesare equally neglected.”I knew well therefore what would be my father’s feelings, but I couldnot tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but whichhad taken an irresistible hold of my imagination. I wished, as itwere, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affectionuntil the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature,should be completed.I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglectto vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he wasjustified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free fromblame. A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm andpeaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire todisturb his tranquillity. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledgeis an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply yourselfhas a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste forthose simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then thatstudy is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the humanmind. If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuitwhatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domesticaffections, Greece had not been enslaved, Cæsar would have spared hiscountry, America would have been discovered more gradually, and theempires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.But I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of mytale, and your looks remind me to proceed.My father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of mysilence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before.Winter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did notwatch the blossom or the expanding leaves—sights which before alwaysyielded me supreme delight—so deeply was I engrossed in myoccupation. The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew nearto a close, and now every day showed me more plainly how well I hadsucceeded. But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appearedrather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any otherunwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment.Every night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a mostpainful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellowcreatures as if I had been guilty of a crime. Sometimes I grew alarmed atthe wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose alonesustained me: my labours would soon end, and I believed that exercise andamusement would then drive away incipient disease; and I promised myselfboth of these when my creation should be complete.Chapter 5It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishmentof my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, Icollected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse aspark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It wasalready one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against thepanes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of thehalf-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creatureopen; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineatethe wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured toform? His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features asbeautiful. Beautiful! Great God! His yellow skin scarcely coveredthe work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrousblack, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but theseluxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes,that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in whichthey were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelingsof human nature. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the solepurpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I haddeprived myself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardourthat far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beautyof the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled myheart. Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, Irushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing mybed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep. At length lassitudesucceeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on thebed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.But it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildestdreams. I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking inthe streets of Ingolstadt. Delighted and surprised, I embraced her,but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid withthe hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that Iheld the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped herform, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel.I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, myteeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim andyellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the windowshutters, I beheld the wretch—the miserable monster whom I hadcreated. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes theymay be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and he muttered someinarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might havespoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly todetain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs. I took refuge in thecourtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remainedduring the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatestagitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as ifit were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which Ihad so miserably given life.Oh! No mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A mummyagain endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. Ihad gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when thosemuscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thingsuch as even Dante could not have conceived.I passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly andhardly that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearlysank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness. Mingled withthis horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that hadbeen my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become ahell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to mysleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steepleand clock, which indicated the sixth hour. The porter opened the gatesof the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I issued intothe streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid thewretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to myview. I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, butfelt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which pouredfrom a black and comfortless sky.I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring bybodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. Itraversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was orwhat I was doing. My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear, and Ihurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me:Like one who, on a lonely road,Doth walk in fear and dread,And, having once turned round, walks on,And turns no more his head;Because he knows a frightful fiendDoth close behind him tread.[Coleridge’s “Ancient Mariner.”]Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the variousdiligences and carriages usually stopped. Here I paused, I knew not why;but I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was comingtowards me from the other end of the street. As it drew nearer I observedthat it was the Swiss diligence; it stopped just where I was standing, andon the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me,instantly sprung out. “My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed he,“how glad I am to see you! How fortunate that you should be here atthe very moment of my alighting!”Nothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought backto my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so dearto my recollection. I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horrorand misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months,calm and serene joy. I welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordialmanner, and we walked towards my college. Clerval continued talking forsome time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in beingpermitted to come to Ingolstadt. “You may easily believe,” saidhe, “how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that allnecessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping;and, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his constantanswer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutchschoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield: ‘I have ten thousand florinsa year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.’ But hisaffection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and he haspermitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land ofknowledge.”“It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you leftmy father, brothers, and Elizabeth.”“Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear fromyou so seldom. By the by, I mean to lecture you a little upon theiraccount myself. But, my dear Frankenstein,” continued he, stoppingshort and gazing full in my face, “I did not before remark how very illyou appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching forseveral nights.”“You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in oneoccupation that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see;but I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at anend and that I am at length free.”I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less toallude to, the occurrences of the preceding night. I walked with aquick pace, and we soon arrived at my college. I then reflected, andthe thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in myapartment might still be there, alive and walking about. I dreaded tobehold this monster, but I feared still more that Henry should see him.Entreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of thestairs, I darted up towards my own room. My hand was already on thelock of the door before I recollected myself. I then paused, and acold shivering came over me. I threw the door forcibly open, aschildren are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand inwaiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared. I steppedfearfully in: the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freedfrom its hideous guest. I could hardly believe that so great a goodfortune could have befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemyhad indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval.We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast;but I was unable to contain myself. It was not joy only that possessedme; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulsebeat rapidly. I was unable to remain for a single instant in the sameplace; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud.Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival,but when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyesfor which he could not account, and my loud, unrestrained, heartlesslaughter frightened and astonished him.“My dear Victor,” cried he, “what, for God’s sake,is the matter? Do not laugh in that manner. How ill you are! What is thecause of all this?”“Do not ask me,” cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for Ithought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; “_he_ cantell. Oh, save me! Save me!” I imagined that the monster seized me;I struggled furiously and fell down in a fit.Poor Clerval! What must have been his feelings? A meeting, which heanticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness. But Iwas not the witness of his grief, for I was lifeless and did notrecover my senses for a long, long time.This was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me forseveral months. During all that time Henry was my only nurse. Iafterwards learned that, knowing my father’s advanced age and unfitnessfor so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would makeElizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of mydisorder. He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentivenurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, hedid not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindestaction that he could towards them.But I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded andunremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life.The form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for everbefore my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him. Doubtless mywords surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderingsof my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which Icontinually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorderindeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed andgrieved my friend, I recovered. I remember the first time I becamecapable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, Iperceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the youngbuds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window. It wasa divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to myconvalescence. I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive inmy bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became ascheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion.“Dearest Clerval,” exclaimed I, “how kind, how very goodyou are to me. This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as youpromised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room. How shall I everrepay you? I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which Ihave been the occasion, but you will forgive me.”“You will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself, but getwell as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, Imay speak to you on one subject, may I not?”I trembled. One subject! What could it be? Could he allude to an object onwhom I dared not even think?“Compose yourself,” said Clerval, who observed my change ofcolour, “I will not mention it if it agitates you; but your fatherand cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in yourown handwriting. They hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy atyour long silence.”“Is that all, my dear Henry? How could you suppose that my firstthought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love andwho are so deserving of my love?”“If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be gladto see a letter that has been lying here some days for you; it is fromyour cousin, I believe.”Chapter 6Clerval then put the following letter into my hands. It was from myown Elizabeth:“My dearest Cousin,“You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dearkind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account. You areforbidden to write—to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor,is necessary to calm our apprehensions. For a long time I have thoughtthat each post would bring this line, and my persuasions haverestrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt. I haveprevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of solong a journey, yet how often have I regretted not being able toperform it myself! I figure to myself that the task of attending onyour sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could neverguess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection ofyour poor cousin. Yet that is over now: Clerval writes that indeedyou are getting better. I eagerly hope that you will confirm thisintelligence soon in your own handwriting.“Get well—and return to us. You will find a happy, cheerful home andfriends who love you dearly. Your father’s health is vigorous, and heasks but to see you, but to be assured that you are well; and not acare will ever cloud his benevolent countenance. How pleased you wouldbe to remark the improvement of our Ernest! He is now sixteen and fullof activity and spirit. He is desirous to be a true Swiss and to enterinto foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until hiselder brother returns to us. My uncle is not pleased with the idea ofa military career in a distant country, but Ernest never had yourpowers of application. He looks upon study as an odious fetter; histime is spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on thelake. I fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the pointand permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.“Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has takenplace since you left us. The blue lake and snow-clad mountains—theynever change; and I think our placid home and our contented hearts areregulated by the same immutable laws. My trifling occupations take upmy time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeingnone but happy, kind faces around me. Since you left us, but onechange has taken place in our little household. Do you remember onwhat occasion Justine Moritz entered our family? Probably you do not;I will relate her history, therefore in a few words. Madame Moritz,her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was thethird. This girl had always been the favourite of her father, butthrough a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, andafter the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill. My aunt observedthis, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her motherto allow her to live at our house. The republican institutions of ourcountry have produced simpler and happier manners than those whichprevail in the great monarchies that surround it. Hence there is lessdistinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and thelower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners aremore refined and moral. A servant in Geneva does not mean the samething as a servant in France and England. Justine, thus received inour family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in ourfortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and asacrifice of the dignity of a human being.“Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and Irecollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, oneglance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason thatAriosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica—she looked sofrank-hearted and happy. My aunt conceived a great attachment for her,by which she was induced to give her an education superior to thatwhich she had at first intended. This benefit was fully repaid;Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world: I do notmean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, butyou could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.Although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate,yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt. Shethought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate herphraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.“When my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their owngrief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illnesswith the most anxious affection. Poor Justine was very ill; but othertrials were reserved for her.“One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with theexception of her neglected daughter, was left childless. Theconscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that thedeaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise herpartiality. She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessorconfirmed the idea which she had conceived. Accordingly, a few monthsafter your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by herrepentant mother. Poor girl! She wept when she quitted our house; shewas much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softnessand a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkablefor vivacity. Nor was her residence at her mother’s house of a natureto restore her gaiety. The poor woman was very vacillating in herrepentance. She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness,but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of herbrothers and sister. Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritzinto a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she isnow at peace for ever. She died on the first approach of cold weather,at the beginning of this last winter. Justine has just returned to us;and I assure you I love her tenderly. She is very clever and gentle,and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and herexpression continually remind me of my dear aunt.“I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darlingWilliam. I wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, withsweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair. When hesmiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy withhealth. He has already had one or two little _wives,_ but Louisa Bironis his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age.“Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a littlegossip concerning the good people of Geneva. The pretty Miss Mansfieldhas already received the congratulatory visits on her approachingmarriage with a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq. Her uglysister, Manon, married M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn. Yourfavourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several misfortunessince the departure of Clerval from Geneva. But he has alreadyrecovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying alively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier. She is a widow, and mucholder than Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite witheverybody.“I have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxietyreturns upon me as I conclude. Write, dearest Victor,—one line—oneword will be a blessing to us. Ten thousand thanks to Henry for hiskindness, his affection, and his many letters; we are sincerelygrateful. Adieu! my cousin; take care of yourself; and, I entreatyou, write!“Elizabeth Lavenza.“Geneva, March 18th, 17—.”“Dear, dear Elizabeth!” I exclaimed, when I had read herletter: “I will write instantly and relieve them from the anxietythey must feel.” I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; butmy convalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly. In anotherfortnight I was able to leave my chamber.One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to theseveral professors of the university. In doing this, I underwent akind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind hadsustained. Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and thebeginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy evento the name of natural philosophy. When I was otherwise quite restoredto health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agonyof my nervous symptoms. Henry saw this, and had removed all myapparatus from my view. He had also changed my apartment; for heperceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which hadpreviously been my laboratory. But these cares of Clerval were made ofno avail when I visited the professors. M. Waldman inflicted torturewhen he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress Ihad made in the sciences. He soon perceived that I disliked thesubject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings tomodesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the scienceitself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out. Whatcould I do? He meant to please, and he tormented me. I felt as if hehad placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments whichwere to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death. Iwrithed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt.Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning thesensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, histotal ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn. Ithanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak. I saw plainlythat he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret fromme; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverencethat knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide inhim that event which was so often present to my recollection, but whichI feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply.M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, ofalmost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me evenmore pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman. “D—nthe fellow!” cried he; “why, M. Clerval, I assure you he hasoutstript us all. Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true. Ayoungster who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmlyas in the gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and ifhe is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.—Ay,ay,” continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering,“M. Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man.Young men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval: I wasmyself when young; but that wears out in a very short time.”M. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turnedthe conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.Clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science; and hisliterary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me. Hecame to the university with the design of making himself completemaster of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field forthe plan of life he had marked out for himself. Resolved to pursue noinglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affordingscope for his spirit of enterprise. The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskritlanguages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter onthe same studies. Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that Iwished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I feltgreat relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found notonly instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists. Idid not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, forI did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporaryamusement. I read merely to understand their meaning, and they wellrepaid my labours. Their melancholy is soothing, and their joyelevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors ofany other country. When you read their writings, life appears toconsist in a warm sun and a garden of roses,—in the smiles and frownsof a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart. Howdifferent from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva wasfixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by severalaccidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable,and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring. I felt thisdelay very bitterly; for I longed to see my native town and my belovedfriends. My return had only been delayed so long, from anunwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had becomeacquainted with any of its inhabitants. The winter, however, was spentcheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it cameits beauty compensated for its dilatoriness.The month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter dailywhich was to fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed apedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt, that I might bid apersonal farewell to the country I had so long inhabited. I accededwith pleasure to this proposition: I was fond of exercise, and Clervalhad always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this naturethat I had taken among the scenes of my native country.We passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and spiritshad long been restored, and they gained additional strength from thesalubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, andthe conversation of my friend. Study had before secluded me from theintercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; butClerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taughtme to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children.Excellent friend! how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour toelevate my mind until it was on a level with your own. A selfishpursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness andaffection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creaturewho, a few years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care.When happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the mostdelightful sensations. A serene sky and verdant fields filled me withecstasy. The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of springbloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud. Iwas undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressedupon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with aninvincible burden.Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: heexerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filledhis soul. The resources of his mind on this occasion were trulyastonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, inimitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderfulfancy and passion. At other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drewme out into arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity.We returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants weredancing, and every one we met appeared gay and happy. My own spirits werehigh, and I bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity.Chapter 7On my return, I found the following letter from my father:—“My dear Victor,“You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date ofyour return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a fewlines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you. Butthat would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it. What would beyour surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, tobehold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness? And how, Victor, canI relate our misfortune? Absence cannot have rendered you callous toour joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absentson? I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it isimpossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the wordswhich are to convey to you the horrible tidings.“William is dead!—that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmedmy heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay! Victor, he is murdered!“I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate thecircumstances of the transaction.“Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went towalk in Plainpalais. The evening was warm and serene, and we prolongedour walk farther than usual. It was already dusk before we thought ofreturning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had goneon before, were not to be found. We accordingly rested on a seat untilthey should return. Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seenhis brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that Williamhad run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, andafterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return.“This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for himuntil night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might havereturned to the house. He was not there. We returned again, withtorches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy hadlost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night;Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish. About five in the morning Idiscovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming andactive in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless; theprint of the murder’s finger was on his neck.“He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in mycountenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth. She was very earnest tosee the corpse. At first I attempted to prevent her but she persisted,and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of thevictim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, ‘O God! I have murdered mydarling child!’“She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When she againlived, it was only to weep and sigh. She told me, that that sameevening William had teased her to let him wear a very valuableminiature that she possessed of your mother. This picture is gone, andwas doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed. Wehave no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover himare unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved William!“Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth. She weepscontinually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death;her words pierce my heart. We are all unhappy; but will not that be anadditional motive for you, my son, to return and be our comforter?Your dear mother! Alas, Victor! I now say, Thank God she did not liveto witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!“Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin,but with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead offestering, the wounds of our minds. Enter the house of mourning, myfriend, but with kindness and affection for those who love you, and notwith hatred for your enemies.“Your affectionate and afflicted father,“Alphonse Frankenstein.“Geneva, May 12th, 17—.”Clerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, wassurprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy I at firstexpressed on receiving new from my friends. I threw the letter on thetable, and covered my face with my hands.“My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed Henry, when he perceived meweep with bitterness, “are you always to be unhappy? My dear friend,what has happened?”I motioned him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down theroom in the extremest agitation. Tears also gushed from the eyes ofClerval, as he read the account of my misfortune.“I can offer you no consolation, my friend,” said he;“your disaster is irreparable. What do you intend to do?”“To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses.”During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation;he could only express his heartfelt sympathy. “Poor William!” said he,“dear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother! Who that hadseen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over hisuntimely loss! To die so miserably; to feel the murderer’s grasp! Howmuch more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence! Poor littlefellow! one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep, buthe is at rest. The pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for ever.A sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain. He can no longerbe a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserablesurvivors.”Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the wordsimpressed themselves on my mind and I remembered them afterwards insolitude. But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into acabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend.My journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on, for I longedto console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when Idrew near my native town, I slackened my progress. I could hardly sustainthe multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. I passed throughscenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years.How altered every thing might be during that time! One sudden anddesolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstancesmight have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although they weredone more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive. Fear overcame me; Idared no advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble,although I was unable to define them.I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind. Icontemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and thesnowy mountains, “the palaces of nature,” were not changed. Bydegrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journeytowards Geneva.The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as Iapproached my native town. I discovered more distinctly the blacksides of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Blanc. I wept like achild. “Dear mountains! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome yourwanderer? Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue andplacid. Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?”I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling onthese preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparativehappiness, and I think of them with pleasure. My country, my belovedcountry! who but a native can tell the delight I took in againbeholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovelylake!Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. Night alsoclosed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt stillmore gloomily. The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and Iforesaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of humanbeings. Alas! I prophesied truly, and failed only in one singlecircumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did notconceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gatesof the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night atSecheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city. The skywas serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spotwhere my poor William had been murdered. As I could not pass through thetown, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais.During this short voyage I saw the lightning playing on the summit of MontBlanc in the most beautiful figures. The storm appeared to approachrapidly, and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe itsprogress. It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the raincoming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and stormincreased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crashover my head. It was echoed from Salêve, the Juras, and the Alps ofSavoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating thelake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instantevery thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itselffrom the preceding flash. The storm, as is often the case inSwitzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. Themost violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of thelake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village ofCopêt. Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and anotherdarkened and sometimes disclosed the Môle, a peaked mountain to theeast of the lake.While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on witha hasty step. This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped myhands, and exclaimed aloud, “William, dear angel! this is thyfuneral, this thy dirge!” As I said these words, I perceived in thegloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stoodfixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightningilluminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; itsgigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongsto humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthydæmon, to whom I had given life. What did he there? Could he be (Ishuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? No sooner did thatidea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teethchattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support. The figurepassed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. Nothing in human shape couldhave destroyed the fair child. _He_ was the murderer! I could notdoubt it. The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of thefact. I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, foranother flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearlyperpendicular ascent of Mont Salêve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on thesouth. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.I remained motionless. The thunder ceased; but the rain stillcontinued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. Irevolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget:the whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance ofthe works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure. Two years hadnow nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; andwas this his first crime? Alas! I had turned loose into the world adepraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he notmurdered my brother?No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of thenight, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did notfeel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy inscenes of evil and despair. I considered the being whom I had castamong mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposesof horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the lightof my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forcedto destroy all that was dear to me.Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town. The gates wereopen, and I hastened to my father’s house. My first thought was todiscover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to bemade. But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell. Abeing whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me atmidnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain. Iremembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just atthe time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air ofdelirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable. I well knew thatif any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should havelooked upon it as the ravings of insanity. Besides, the strange natureof the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far creditedas to persuade my relatives to commence it. And then of what use wouldbe pursuit? Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling theoverhanging sides of Mont Salêve? These reflections determined me, andI resolved to remain silent.It was about five in the morning when I entered my father’s house. Itold the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the libraryto attend their usual hour of rising.Six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and Istood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before mydeparture for Ingolstadt. Beloved and venerable parent! He still remainedto me. I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over themantel-piece. It was an historical subject, painted at my father’sdesire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneelingby the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale;but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted thesentiment of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of William; and mytears flowed when I looked upon it. While I was thus engaged, Ernestentered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me:“Welcome, my dearest Victor,” said he. “Ah! I wish youhad come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous anddelighted. You come to us now to share a misery which nothing canalleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seemssinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poorElizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.—PoorWilliam! he was our darling and our pride!”Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother’s eyes; a sense of mortalagony crept over my frame. Before, I had only imagined thewretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, anda not less terrible, disaster. I tried to calm Ernest; I enquired moreminutely concerning my father, and here I named my cousin.“She most of all,” said Ernest, “requires consolation; she accusedherself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made hervery wretched. But since the murderer has been discovered—”“The murderer discovered! Good God! how can that be? who could attemptto pursue him? It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake thewinds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw. I saw him too; hewas free last night!”“I do not know what you mean,” replied my brother, in accents ofwonder, “but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery. Noone would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not beconvinced, notwithstanding all the evidence. Indeed, who would creditthat Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family,could suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?”“Justine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the accused? But it iswrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?”“No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that havealmost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been soconfused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear,leaves no hope for doubt. But she will be tried today, and you willthen hear all.”He then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor Williamhad been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to herbed for several days. During this interval, one of the servants,happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of themurder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, whichhad been judged to be the temptation of the murderer. The servantinstantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word toany of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition,Justine was apprehended. On being charged with the fact, the poor girlconfirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion ofmanner.This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I repliedearnestly, “You are all mistaken; I know the murderer. Justine, poor,good Justine, is innocent.”At that instant my father entered. I saw unhappiness deeply impressedon his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and,after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introducedsome other topic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed,“Good God, papa! Victor says that he knows who was the murderer ofpoor William.”“We do also, unfortunately,” replied my father, “for indeed I hadrather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so muchdepravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly.”“My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.”“If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. She is to betried today, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.”This speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own mind thatJustine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder. Ihad no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could bebrought forward strong enough to convict her. My tale was not one toannounce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon asmadness by the vulgar. Did any one indeed exist, except I, thecreator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in theexistence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorancewhich I had let loose upon the world?We were soon joined by Elizabeth. Time had altered her since I lastbeheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty ofher childish years. There was the same candour, the same vivacity, butit was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect.She welcomed me with the greatest affection. “Your arrival, my dearcousin,” said she, “fills me with hope. You perhaps will find somemeans to justify my poor guiltless Justine. Alas! who is safe, if shebe convicted of crime? I rely on her innocence as certainly as I doupon my own. Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not onlylost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerelylove, is to be torn away by even a worse fate. If she is condemned, Inever shall know joy more. But she will not, I am sure she will not;and then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my littleWilliam.”“She is innocent, my Elizabeth,” said I, “and that shallbe proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assuranceof her acquittal.”“How kind and generous you are! every one else believes in her guilt,and that made me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible: and tosee every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered mehopeless and despairing.” She wept.“Dearest niece,” said my father, “dry your tears. If sheis, as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and theactivity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow ofpartiality.”Chapter 8We passed a few sad hours until eleven o’clock, when the trial was tocommence. My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attendas witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. During the whole ofthis wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture. It was tobe decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices wouldcause the death of two of my fellow beings: one a smiling babe full ofinnocence and joy, the other far more dreadfully murdered, with everyaggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.Justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promisedto render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in anignominious grave, and I the cause! A thousand times rather would Ihave confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but Iwas absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would havebeen considered as the ravings of a madman and would not haveexculpated her who suffered through me.The appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning, andher countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of herfeelings, exquisitely beautiful. Yet she appeared confident ininnocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated bythousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise haveexcited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by theimagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed. Shewas tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and asher confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, sheworked up her mind to an appearance of courage. When she entered thecourt she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we wereseated. A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quicklyrecovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attesther utter guiltlessness.The trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated thecharge, several witnesses were called. Several strange facts combinedagainst her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proofof her innocence as I had. She had been out the whole of the night onwhich the murder had been committed and towards morning had beenperceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of themurdered child had been afterwards found. The woman asked her what shedid there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confusedand unintelligible answer. She returned to the house about eighto’clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, shereplied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestlyif anything had been heard concerning him. When shown the body, shefell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days. Thepicture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket;and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the samewhich, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed roundhis neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.Justine was called on for her defence. As the trial had proceeded, hercountenance had altered. Surprise, horror, and misery were stronglyexpressed. Sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she wasdesired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audiblealthough variable voice.“God knows,” she said, “how entirely I am innocent. But Ido not pretend that my protestations should acquit me; I rest my innocenceon a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adducedagainst me, and I hope the character I have always borne will incline myjudges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appearsdoubtful or suspicious.”She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passedthe evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at thehouse of an aunt at Chêne, a village situated at about a league fromGeneva. On her return, at about nine o’clock, she met a man who askedher if she had seen anything of the child who was lost. She wasalarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him,when the gates of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remainseveral hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, beingunwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known. Mostof the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed thatshe slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke.It was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavourto find my brother. If she had gone near the spot where his body lay,it was without her knowledge. That she had been bewildered whenquestioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passeda sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain.Concerning the picture she could give no account.“I know,” continued the unhappy victim, “how heavily andfatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power ofexplaining it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only leftto conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have beenplaced in my pocket. But here also I am checked. I believe that I have noenemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy mewantonly. Did the murderer place it there? I know of no opportunityafforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why should he have stolen thejewel, to part with it again so soon?“I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room forhope. I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning mycharacter, and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposedguilt, I must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on myinnocence.”Several witnesses were called who had known her for many years, andthey spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which theysupposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to comeforward. Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellentdispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused,when, although violently agitated, she desired permission to addressthe court.“I am,” said she, “the cousin of the unhappy child whowas murdered, or rather his sister, for I was educated by and have livedwith his parents ever since and even long before his birth. It maytherefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion, butwhen I see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of herpretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what Iknow of her character. I am well acquainted with the accused. I have livedin the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearlytwo years. During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable andbenevolent of human creatures. She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, inher last illness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwardsattended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excitedthe admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in myuncle’s house, where she was beloved by all the family. She waswarmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like amost affectionate mother. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that,notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and relyon her perfect innocence. She had no temptation for such an action; as tothe bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it,I should have willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem and valueher.”A murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth’s simple and powerfulappeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not infavour of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned withrenewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude. Sheherself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer. My ownagitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial. I believedin her innocence; I knew it. Could the dæmon who had (I did not for aminute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport havebetrayed the innocent to death and ignominy? I could not sustain thehorror of my situation, and when I perceived that the popular voice andthe countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim,I rushed out of the court in agony. The tortures of the accused didnot equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs ofremorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold.I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. In the morning I went tothe court; my lips and throat were parched. I dared not ask the fatalquestion, but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of myvisit. The ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justinewas condemned.I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. I had beforeexperienced sensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to bestow uponthem adequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of theheart-sickening despair that I then endured. The person to whom Iaddressed myself added that Justine had already confessed her guilt.“That evidence,” he observed, “was hardly required in so glaring acase, but I am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our judges like tocondemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever sodecisive.”This was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean? Hadmy eyes deceived me? And was I really as mad as the whole world wouldbelieve me to be if I disclosed the object of my suspicions? Ihastened to return home, and Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result.“My cousin,” replied I, “it is decided as you may have expected; alljudges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guiltyshould escape. But she has confessed.”This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness uponJustine’s innocence. “Alas!” said she. “How shall Iever again believe in human goodness? Justine, whom I loved and esteemed asmy sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray?Her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and yet she hascommitted a murder.”Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see mycousin. My father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her ownjudgment and feelings to decide. “Yes,” said Elizabeth,“I will go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompanyme; I cannot go alone.” The idea of this visit was torture to me, yetI could not refuse.We entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld Justine sitting on somestraw at the farther end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested onher knees. She rose on seeing us enter, and when we were left alone withher, she threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly. Mycousin wept also.“Oh, Justine!” said she. “Why did you rob me of my last consolation?I relied on your innocence, and although I was then very wretched, Iwas not so miserable as I am now.”“And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked? Do you alsojoin with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer?” Hervoice was suffocated with sobs.“Rise, my poor girl,” said Elizabeth; “why do you kneel,if you are innocent? I am not one of your enemies, I believed youguiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you hadyourself declared your guilt. That report, you say, is false; and beassured, dear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for amoment, but your own confession.”“I did confess, but I confessed a lie. I confessed, that I mightobtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart thanall my other sins. The God of heaven forgive me! Ever since I wascondemned, my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced,until I almost began to think that I was the monster that he said Iwas. He threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments ifI continued obdurate. Dear lady, I had none to support me; all lookedon me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition. What could I do?In an evil hour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I trulymiserable.”She paused, weeping, and then continued, “I thought with horror, mysweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom your blessedaunt had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capableof a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated.Dear William! dearest blessed child! I soon shall see you again inheaven, where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as Iam to suffer ignominy and death.”“Oh, Justine! Forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you.Why did you confess? But do not mourn, dear girl. Do not fear. Iwill proclaim, I will prove your innocence. I will melt the stonyhearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers. You shall not die!You, my playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold!No! No! I never could survive so horrible a misfortune.”Justine shook her head mournfully. “I do not fear to die,” she said;“that pang is past. God raises my weakness and gives me courage toendure the worst. I leave a sad and bitter world; and if you rememberme and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, I am resigned to thefate awaiting me. Learn from me, dear lady, to submit in patience tothe will of heaven!”During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison room,where I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me. Despair!Who dared talk of that? The poor victim, who on the morrow was to passthe awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as I did, suchdeep and bitter agony. I gnashed my teeth and ground them together,uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul. Justine started. Whenshe saw who it was, she approached me and said, “Dear sir, you are verykind to visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am guilty?”I could not answer. “No, Justine,” said Elizabeth; “he is moreconvinced of your innocence than I was, for even when he heard that youhad confessed, he did not credit it.”“I truly thank him. In these last moments I feel the sincerestgratitude towards those who think of me with kindness. How sweet isthe affection of others to such a wretch as I am! It removes more thanhalf my misfortune, and I feel as if I could die in peace now that myinnocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin.”Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself. She indeedgained the resignation she desired. But I, the true murderer, felt thenever-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope orconsolation. Elizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also wasthe misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fairmoon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness. Anguish anddespair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell withinme which nothing could extinguish. We stayed several hours withJustine, and it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could tearherself away. “I wish,” cried she, “that I were to die with you; Icannot live in this world of misery.”Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficultyrepressed her bitter tears. She embraced Elizabeth and said in a voiceof half-suppressed emotion, “Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth,my beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless andpreserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will eversuffer! Live, and be happy, and make others so.”And on the morrow Justine died. Elizabeth’s heart-rending eloquencefailed to move the judges from their settled conviction in thecriminality of the saintly sufferer. My passionate and indignantappeals were lost upon them. And when I received their cold answersand heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposedavowal died away on my lips. Thus I might proclaim myself a madman,but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim. Sheperished on the scaffold as a murderess!From the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep andvoiceless grief of my Elizabeth. This also was my doing! And myfather’s woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home all wasthe work of my thrice-accursed hands! Ye weep, unhappy ones, but theseare not your last tears! Again shall you raise the funeral wail, andthe sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard!Frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; hewho would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has nothought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dearcountenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his lifein serving you—he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyondhis hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destructionpause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments!Thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair,I beheld those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William andJustine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts.Chapter 9Nothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings havebeen worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness ofinaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hopeand fear. Justine died, she rested, and I was alive. The blood flowedfreely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on myheart which nothing could remove. Sleep fled from my eyes; I wanderedlike an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief beyonddescription horrible, and more, much more (I persuaded myself) was yetbehind. Yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue.I had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the momentwhen I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellowbeings. Now all was blasted; instead of that serenity of consciencewhich allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, andfrom thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse andthe sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense torturessuch as no language can describe.This state of mind preyed upon my health, which had perhaps neverentirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained. I shunnedthe face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me;solitude was my only consolation—deep, dark, deathlike solitude.My father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my dispositionand habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of hisserene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude andawaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me.“Do you think, Victor,” said he, “that I do not sufferalso? No one could love a child more than I loved yourbrother”—tears came into his eyes as he spoke—“butis it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmentingtheir unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief? It is also a dutyowed to yourself, for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment,or even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no man is fit forsociety.”This advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; Ishould have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends ifremorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with myother sensations. Now I could only answer my father with a look ofdespair and endeavour to hide myself from his view.About this time we retired to our house at Belrive. This change wasparticularly agreeable to me. The shutting of the gates regularly atten o’clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after thathour had rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksometo me. I was now free. Often, after the rest of the family hadretired for the night, I took the boat and passed many hours upon thewater. Sometimes, with my sails set, I was carried by the wind; andsometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, I left the boat topursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections. Iwas often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the onlyunquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful andheavenly—if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh andinterrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shore—often,I say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the watersmight close over me and my calamities for ever. But I was restrained,when I thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderlyloved, and whose existence was bound up in mine. I thought also of myfather and surviving brother; should I by my base desertion leave themexposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let looseamong them?At these moments I wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit mymind only that I might afford them consolation and happiness. But thatcould not be. Remorse extinguished every hope. I had been the author ofunalterable evils, and I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I hadcreated should perpetrate some new wickedness. I had an obscure feelingthat all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime,which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past.There was always scope for fear so long as anything I loved remainedbehind. My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived. When I thought ofhim I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently wished toextinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed. When Ireflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all boundsof moderation. I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of theAndes, could I, when there, have precipitated him to their base. I wishedto see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on hishead and avenge the deaths of William and Justine.Our house was the house of mourning. My father’s health was deeplyshaken by the horror of the recent events. Elizabeth was sad anddesponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; allpleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears shethen thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blastedand destroyed. She was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youthwandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of ourfuture prospects. The first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us fromthe earth had visited her, and its dimming influence quenched her dearestsmiles.“When I reflect, my dear cousin,” said she, “on the miserable death ofJustine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works as they beforeappeared to me. Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice andinjustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of ancientdays or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar toreason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and menappear to me as monsters thirsting for each other’s blood. Yet I amcertainly unjust. Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty; andif she could have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredlyshe would have been the most depraved of human creatures. For the sakeof a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend,a child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as ifit had been her own! I could not consent to the death of any humanbeing, but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit toremain in the society of men. But she was innocent. I know, I feelshe was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me.Alas! Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who canassure themselves of certain happiness? I feel as if I were walking onthe edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding andendeavouring to plunge me into the abyss. William and Justine wereassassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free,and perhaps respected. But even if I were condemned to suffer on thescaffold for the same crimes, I would not change places with such awretch.”I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony. I, not in deed,but in effect, was the true murderer. Elizabeth read my anguish in mycountenance, and kindly taking my hand, said, “My dearest friend, youmust calm yourself. These events have affected me, God knows howdeeply; but I am not so wretched as you are. There is an expression ofdespair, and sometimes of revenge, in your countenance that makes metremble. Dear Victor, banish these dark passions. Remember thefriends around you, who centre all their hopes in you. Have we lostthe power of rendering you happy? Ah! While we love, while we aretrue to each other, here in this land of peace and beauty, your nativecountry, we may reap every tranquil blessing—what can disturb ourpeace?”And could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before everyother gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in myheart? Even as she spoke I drew near to her, as if in terror, lest atthat very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her.Thus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor ofheaven, could redeem my soul from woe; the very accents of love wereineffectual. I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficialinfluence could penetrate. The wounded deer dragging its faintinglimbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which hadpierced it, and to die, was but a type of me.Sometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me, butsometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodilyexercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerablesensations. It was during an access of this kind that I suddenly leftmy home, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys, soughtin the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself andmy ephemeral, because human, sorrows. My wanderings were directedtowards the valley of Chamounix. I had visited it frequently during myboyhood. Six years had passed since then: _I_ was a wreck, but noughthad changed in those savage and enduring scenes.I performed the first part of my journey on horseback. I afterwardshired a mule, as the more sure-footed and least liable to receiveinjury on these rugged roads. The weather was fine; it was about themiddle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death ofJustine, that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe. Theweight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper inthe ravine of Arve. The immense mountains and precipices that overhungme on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, andthe dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty asOmnipotence—and I ceased to fear or to bend before any being lessalmighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, heredisplayed in their most terrific guise. Still, as I ascended higher,the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character.Ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains, theimpetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth fromamong the trees formed a scene of singular beauty. But it wasaugmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white andshining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to anotherearth, the habitations of another race of beings.I passed the bridge of Pélissier, where the ravine, which the riverforms, opened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain thatoverhangs it. Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix. Thisvalley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful andpicturesque as that of Servox, through which I had just passed. Thehigh and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but I saw nomore ruined castles and fertile fields. Immense glaciers approachedthe road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche andmarked the smoke of its passage. Mont Blanc, the supreme andmagnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the surrounding _aiguilles_,and its tremendous _dôme_ overlooked the valley.A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during thisjourney. Some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived andrecognised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with thelighthearted gaiety of boyhood. The very winds whispered in soothingaccents, and maternal Nature bade me weep no more. Then again thekindly influence ceased to act—I found myself fettered again to griefand indulging in all the misery of reflection. Then I spurred on myanimal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all,myself—or, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted and threw myself onthe grass, weighed down by horror and despair.At length I arrived at the village of Chamounix. Exhaustion succeededto the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which I had endured.For a short space of time I remained at the window watching the pallidlightnings that played above Mont Blanc and listening to the rushing ofthe Arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath. The same lulling soundsacted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; when I placed my headupon my pillow, sleep crept over me; I felt it as it came and blessedthe giver of oblivion.Chapter 10I spent the following day roaming through the valley. I stood besidethe sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, thatwith slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills tobarricade the valley. The abrupt sides of vast mountains were beforeme; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines werescattered around; and the solemn silence of this gloriouspresence-chamber of imperial Nature was broken only by the brawlingwaves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of theavalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of theaccumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws,was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything intheir hands. These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me thegreatest consolation that I was capable of receiving. They elevated mefrom all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove mygrief, they subdued and tranquillised it. In some degree, also, theydiverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for thelast month. I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were,waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which Ihad contemplated during the day. They congregated round me; theunstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods,and ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds—they allgathered round me and bade me be at peace.Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke? All ofsoul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded everythought. The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid thesummits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of thosemighty friends. Still I would penetrate their misty veil and seek themin their cloudy retreats. What were rain and storm to me? My mule wasbrought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit ofMontanvert. I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendousand ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it.It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to thesoul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy.The sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always theeffect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget the passingcares of life. I determined to go without a guide, for I was wellacquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy thesolitary grandeur of the scene.The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and shortwindings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of themountain. It is a scene terrifically desolate. In a thousand spotsthe traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees liebroken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent,leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely uponother trees. The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravinesof snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them isparticularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speakingin a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to drawdestruction upon the head of the speaker. The pines are not tall orluxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene.I looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the riverswhich ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the oppositemountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rainpoured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression Ireceived from the objects around me. Alas! Why does man boast ofsensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only rendersthem more necessary beings. If our impulses were confined to hunger,thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved byevery wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word mayconvey to us.We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.We rise; one wand’ring thought pollutes the day.We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;It is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow,The path of its departure still is free.Man’s yesterday may ne’er be like his morrow;Nought may endure but mutability!It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent. For sometime I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. A mist coveredboth that and the surrounding mountains. Presently a breeze dissipatedthe cloud, and I descended upon the glacier. The surface is veryuneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, andinterspersed by rifts that sink deep. The field of ice is almost aleague in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it. Theopposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock. From the side where Inow stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league;and above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty. I remained in a recessof the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene. The sea,or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains,whose aerial summits hung over its recesses. Their icy and glitteringpeaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds. My heart, which wasbefore sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed,“Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrowbeds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion,away from the joys of life.”As I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance,advancing towards me with superhuman speed. He bounded over thecrevices in the ice, among which I had walked with caution; hisstature, also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that of man. I wastroubled; a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me,but I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains. Iperceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred!)that it was the wretch whom I had created. I trembled with rage andhorror, resolving to wait his approach and then close with him inmortal combat. He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish,combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly uglinessrendered it almost too horrible for human eyes. But I scarcelyobserved this; rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance,and I recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furiousdetestation and contempt.“Devil,” I exclaimed, “do you dare approach me? And donot you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head?Begone, vile insect! Or rather, stay, that I may trample you to dust! And,oh! That I could, with the extinction of your miserable existence, restorethose victims whom you have so diabolically murdered!”“I expected this reception,” said the dæmon. “All men hate thewretched; how, then, must I be hated, who am miserable beyond allliving things! Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature,to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation ofone of us. You purpose to kill me. How dare you sport thus with life?Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest ofmankind. If you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them andyou at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until itbe satiated with the blood of your remaining friends.”“Abhorred monster! Fiend that thou art! The tortures of hell are toomild a vengeance for thy crimes. Wretched devil! You reproach me withyour creation, come on, then, that I may extinguish the spark which Iso negligently bestowed.”My rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all thefeelings which can arm one being against the existence of another.He easily eluded me and said,“Be calm! I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatredon my devoted head. Have I not suffered enough, that you seek toincrease my misery? Life, although it may only be an accumulation ofanguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it. Remember, thou hast mademe more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine, myjoints more supple. But I will not be tempted to set myself inopposition to thee. I am thy creature, and I will be even mild anddocile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part,the which thou owest me. Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to everyother and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thyclemency and affection, is most due. Remember that I am thy creature;I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thoudrivest from joy for no misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from which Ialone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery mademe a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.”“Begone! I will not hear you. There can be no community between youand me; we are enemies. Begone, or let us try our strength in a fight,in which one must fall.”“How can I move thee? Will no entreaties cause thee to turn afavourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness andcompassion? Believe me, Frankenstein, I was benevolent; my soul glowedwith love and humanity; but am I not alone, miserably alone? You, mycreator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures,who owe me nothing? They spurn and hate me. The desert mountains anddreary glaciers are my refuge. I have wandered here many days; thecaves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and theonly one which man does not grudge. These bleak skies I hail, for theyare kinder to me than your fellow beings. If the multitude of mankindknew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves formy destruction. Shall I not then hate them who abhor me? I will keepno terms with my enemies. I am miserable, and they shall share mywretchedness. Yet it is in your power to recompense me, and deliverthem from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, thatnot only you and your family, but thousands of others, shall beswallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage. Let your compassion bemoved, and do not disdain me. Listen to my tale; when you have heardthat, abandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge that I deserve.But hear me. The guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as theyare, to speak in their own defence before they are condemned. Listento me, Frankenstein. You accuse me of murder, and yet you would, witha satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature. Oh, praise theeternal justice of man! Yet I ask you not to spare me; listen to me,and then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your hands.”“Why do you call to my remembrance,” I rejoined, “circumstances ofwhich I shudder to reflect, that I have been the miserable origin andauthor? Cursed be the day, abhorred devil, in which you first sawlight! Cursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that formed you!You have made me wretched beyond expression. You have left me no powerto consider whether I am just to you or not. Begone! Relieve me fromthe sight of your detested form.”“Thus I relieve thee, my creator,” he said, and placed his hated handsbefore my eyes, which I flung from me with violence; “thus I take fromthee a sight which you abhor. Still thou canst listen to me and grantme thy compassion. By the virtues that I once possessed, I demand thisfrom you. Hear my tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature ofthis place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut uponthe mountain. The sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descendsto hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate anotherworld, you will have heard my story and can decide. On you it rests,whether I quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmlesslife, or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author ofyour own speedy ruin.”As he said this he led the way across the ice; I followed. My heartwas full, and I did not answer him, but as I proceeded, I weighed thevarious arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen tohis tale. I was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed myresolution. I had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of mybrother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion.For the first time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator towardshis creature were, and that I ought to render him happy before Icomplained of his wickedness. These motives urged me to comply withhis demand. We crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the oppositerock. The air was cold, and the rain again began to descend; weentered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavyheart and depressed spirits. But I consented to listen, and seatingmyself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted, he thus beganhis tale.Chapter 11“It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era ofmy being; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct.A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard,and smelt at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before Ilearned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses. Bydegrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that Iwas obliged to shut my eyes. Darkness then came over me and troubledme, but hardly had I felt this when, by opening my eyes, as I nowsuppose, the light poured in upon me again. I walked and, I believe,descended, but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations.Before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to mytouch or sight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, withno obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid. The lightbecame more and more oppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as Iwalked, I sought a place where I could receive shade. This was theforest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook restingfrom my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst. Thisroused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which Ifound hanging on the trees or lying on the ground. I slaked my thirstat the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.“It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half frightened, as itwere, instinctively, finding myself so desolate. Before I had quittedyour apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with someclothes, but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews ofnight. I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and coulddistinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, I satdown and wept.“Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation ofpleasure. I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among thetrees. [The moon] I gazed with a kind of wonder. It moved slowly,but it enlightened my path, and I again went out in search of berries.I was still cold when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, withwhich I covered myself, and sat down upon the ground. No distinctideas occupied my mind; all was confused. I felt light, and hunger,and thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my ears, and onall sides various scents saluted me; the only object that I coulddistinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that withpleasure.“Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night hadgreatly lessened, when I began to distinguish my sensations from eachother. I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me withdrink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage. I was delightedwhen I first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted myears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who hadoften intercepted the light from my eyes. I began also to observe,with greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me and to perceive theboundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me. Sometimes Itried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable.Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but theuncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me intosilence again.“The moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessenedform, showed itself, while I still remained in the forest. Mysensations had by this time become distinct, and my mind received everyday additional ideas. My eyes became accustomed to the light and toperceive objects in their right forms; I distinguished the insect fromthe herb, and by degrees, one herb from another. I found that thesparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird andthrush were sweet and enticing.“One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had beenleft by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at thewarmth I experienced from it. In my joy I thrust my hand into the liveembers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain. How strange,I thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects! Iexamined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to becomposed of wood. I quickly collected some branches, but they were wetand would not burn. I was pained at this and sat still watching theoperation of the fire. The wet wood which I had placed near the heatdried and itself became inflamed. I reflected on this, and by touchingthe various branches, I discovered the cause and busied myself incollecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it and have aplentiful supply of fire. When night came on and brought sleep withit, I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished. Icovered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branchesupon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and sankinto sleep.“It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire.I uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame. Iobserved this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused theembers when they were nearly extinguished. When night came again Ifound, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and thatthe discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for I foundsome of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, andtasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees. Itried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it onthe live embers. I found that the berries were spoiled by thisoperation, and the nuts and roots much improved.“Food, however, became scarce, and I often spent the whole daysearching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. WhenI found this, I resolved to quit the place that I had hithertoinhabited, to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would bemore easily satisfied. In this emigration I exceedingly lamented theloss of the fire which I had obtained through accident and knew not howto reproduce it. I gave several hours to the serious consideration ofthis difficulty, but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supplyit, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the woodtowards the setting sun. I passed three days in these rambles and atlength discovered the open country. A great fall of snow had takenplace the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white; theappearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the colddamp substance that covered the ground.“It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food andshelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, whichhad doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd. Thiswas a new sight to me, and I examined the structure with greatcuriosity. Finding the door open, I entered. An old man sat in it,near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast. He turned onhearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting thehut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated formhardly appeared capable. His appearance, different from any I had everbefore seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me. But I was enchantedby the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could notpenetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisiteand divine a retreat as Pandæmonium appeared to the dæmons of hellafter their sufferings in the lake of fire. I greedily devoured theremnants of the shepherd’s breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese,milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like. Then, overcome byfatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep.“It was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, whichshone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence mytravels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant’s breakfast in awallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, untilat sunset I arrived at a village. How miraculous did this appear! Thehuts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration byturns. The vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I sawplaced at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite. Oneof the best of these I entered, but I had hardly placed my foot withinthe door before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted.The whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until,grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, Iescaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel,quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I hadbeheld in the village. This hovel however, joined a cottage of a neatand pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, Idared not enter it. My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but solow that I could with difficulty sit upright in it. No wood, however,was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; andalthough the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it anagreeable asylum from the snow and rain.“Here, then, I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter,however miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still morefrom the barbarity of man. As soon as morning dawned I crept from mykennel, that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I couldremain in the habitation I had found. It was situated against the backof the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pigsty and a clear pool of water. One part was open, and by that I hadcrept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceivedwith stones and wood, yet in such a manner that I might move them onoccasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty, andthat was sufficient for me.“Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, Iretired, for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I rememberedtoo well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power. Ihad first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day by a loafof coarse bread, which I purloined, and a cup with which I could drinkmore conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed bymy retreat. The floor was a little raised, so that it was keptperfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it wastolerably warm.“Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel untilsomething should occur which might alter my determination. It wasindeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence,the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth. I ate my breakfast withpleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a littlewater when I heard a step, and looking through a small chink, I behelda young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel. Thegirl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since foundcottagers and farmhouse servants to be. Yet she was meanly dressed, acoarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fairhair was plaited but not adorned: she looked patient yet sad. I lostsight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearingthe pail, which was now partly filled with milk. As she walked along,seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whosecountenance expressed a deeper despondence. Uttering a few sounds withan air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to thecottage himself. She followed, and they disappeared. Presently I sawthe young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the fieldbehind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in thehouse and sometimes in the yard.“On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of thecottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had beenfilled up with wood. In one of these was a small and almostimperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate.Through this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and cleanbut very bare of furniture. In one corner, near a small fire, sat anold man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude. Theyoung girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently shetook something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she satdown beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to playand to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or thenightingale. It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who hadnever beheld aught beautiful before. The silver hair and benevolentcountenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentlemanners of the girl enticed my love. He played a sweet mournful airwhich I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, ofwhich the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he thenpronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, kneltat his feet. He raised her and smiled with such kindness and affectionthat I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they werea mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never before experienced,either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from thewindow, unable to bear these emotions.“Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders aload of wood. The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him ofhis burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it onthe fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage,and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese. She seemedpleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which sheplaced in water, and then upon the fire. She afterwards continued herwork, whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busilyemployed in digging and pulling up roots. After he had been employedthus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they entered thecottage together.“The old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearanceof his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down toeat. The meal was quickly dispatched. The young woman was againoccupied in arranging the cottage, the old man walked before thecottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth.Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellentcreatures. One was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beamingwith benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in hisfigure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry, yet hiseyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency. Theold man returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools differentfrom those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across thefields.“Night quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, I found that thecottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers, and wasdelighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to thepleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours. In the eveningthe young girl and her companion were employed in various occupationswhich I did not understand; and the old man again took up theinstrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me inthe morning. So soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play,but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling theharmony of the old man’s instrument nor the songs of the birds; I sincefound that he read aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of thescience of words or letters.“The family, after having been thus occupied for a short time,extinguished their lights and retired, as I conjectured, to rest.”Chapter 12“I lay on my straw, but I could not sleep. I thought of theoccurrences of the day. What chiefly struck me was the gentle mannersof these people, and I longed to join them, but dared not. Iremembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before fromthe barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct Imight hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present I wouldremain quietly in my hovel, watching and endeavouring to discover themotives which influenced their actions.“The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun. The young womanarranged the cottage and prepared the food, and the youth departedafter the first meal.“This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it.The young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl invarious laborious occupations within. The old man, whom I soonperceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument orin contemplation. Nothing could exceed the love and respect which theyounger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion. Theyperformed towards him every little office of affection and duty withgentleness, and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles.“They were not entirely happy. The young man and his companion oftenwent apart and appeared to weep. I saw no cause for their unhappiness,but I was deeply affected by it. If such lovely creatures weremiserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being,should be wretched. Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy? Theypossessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and everyluxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viandswhen hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more,they enjoyed one another’s company and speech, interchanging each daylooks of affection and kindness. What did their tears imply? Did theyreally express pain? I was at first unable to solve these questions,but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances whichwere at first enigmatic.“A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes ofthe uneasiness of this amiable family: it was poverty, and theysuffered that evil in a very distressing degree. Their nourishmentconsisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk ofone cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masterscould scarcely procure food to support it. They often, I believe,suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the twoyounger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the oldman when they reserved none for themselves.“This trait of kindness moved me sensibly. I had been accustomed,during the night, to steal a part of their store for my ownconsumption, but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain onthe cottagers, I abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, androots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood.“I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assisttheir labours. I found that the youth spent a great part of each dayin collecting wood for the family fire, and during the night I oftentook his tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought homefiring sufficient for the consumption of several days.“I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when sheopened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a greatpile of wood on the outside. She uttered some words in a loud voice, and theyouth joined her, who also expressed surprise. I observed, with pleasure,that he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing thecottage and cultivating the garden.“By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment. I found thatthese people possessed a method of communicating their experience andfeelings to one another by articulate sounds. I perceived that the wordsthey spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in theminds and countenances of the hearers. This was indeed a godlike science,and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it. But I was baffled inevery attempt I made for this purpose. Their pronunciation was quick, andthe words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visibleobjects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel themystery of their reference. By great application, however, and after havingremained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, Idiscovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects ofdiscourse; I learned and applied the words, _fire, milk, bread,_ and_wood._ I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves. The youthand his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had onlyone, which was _father._ The girl was called _sister_ or_Agatha,_ and the youth _Felix, brother,_ or _son_. I cannotdescribe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each ofthese sounds and was able to pronounce them. I distinguished several otherwords without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as _good,dearest, unhappy._“I spent the winter in this manner. The gentle manners and beauty ofthe cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, Ifelt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathised in their joys. I sawfew human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter thecottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me thesuperior accomplishments of my friends. The old man, I could perceive,often endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found thathe called them, to cast off their melancholy. He would talk in acheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasureeven upon me. Agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filledwith tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but Igenerally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful afterhaving listened to the exhortations of her father. It was not thuswith Felix. He was always the saddest of the group, and even to myunpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than hisfriends. But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was morecheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the oldman.“I could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, markedthe dispositions of these amiable cottagers. In the midst of povertyand want, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first littlewhite flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground. Early inthe morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow thatobstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, andbrought the wood from the outhouse, where, to his perpetualastonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisiblehand. In the day, I believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouringfarmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner,yet brought no wood with him. At other times he worked in the garden,but as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the oldman and Agatha.“This reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees Idiscovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as whenhe talked. I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signsfor speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehendthese also; but how was that possible when I did not even understandthe sounds for which they stood as signs? I improved, however,sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind ofconversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour, for Ieasily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself tothe cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first becomemaster of their language, which knowledge might enable me to make themoverlook the deformity of my figure, for with this also the contrastperpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.“I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers—their grace, beauty,and delicate complexions; but how was I terrified when I viewed myselfin a transparent pool! At first I started back, unable to believe thatit was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I becamefully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I wasfilled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification.Alas! I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserabledeformity.“As the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snowvanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth. From thistime Felix was more employed, and the heart-moving indications ofimpending famine disappeared. Their food, as I afterwards found, wascoarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it.Several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which theydressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the seasonadvanced.“The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it didnot rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth itswaters. This frequently took place, but a high wind quickly dried theearth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been.“My mode of life in my hovel was uniform. During the morning Iattended the motions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed invarious occupations, I slept; the remainder of the day was spent inobserving my friends. When they had retired to rest, if there was anymoon or the night was star-light, I went into the woods and collectedmy own food and fuel for the cottage. When I returned, as often as itwas necessary, I cleared their path from the snow and performed thoseoffices that I had seen done by Felix. I afterwards found that theselabours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; andonce or twice I heard them, on these occasions, utter the words _goodspirit, wonderful_; but I did not then understand the significationof these terms.“My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover themotives and feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive toknow why Felix appeared so miserable and Agatha so sad. I thought(foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to restore happiness tothese deserving people. When I slept or was absent, the forms of thevenerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felixflitted before me. I looked upon them as superior beings who would bethe arbiters of my future destiny. I formed in my imagination athousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception ofme. I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentledemeanour and conciliating words, I should first win their favour andafterwards their love.“These thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour tothe acquiring the art of language. My organs were indeed harsh, butsupple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of theirtones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease.It was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whoseintentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deservedbetter treatment than blows and execration.“The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered theaspect of the earth. Men who before this change seemed to have beenhid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts ofcultivation. The birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leavesbegan to bud forth on the trees. Happy, happy earth! Fit habitationfor gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, andunwholesome. My spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance ofnature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil,and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy.”Chapter 13“I now hasten to the more moving part of my story. I shall relateevents that impressed me with feelings which, from what I had been,have made me what I am.“Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine and the skiescloudless. It surprised me that what before was desert and gloomyshould now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure. Mysenses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight anda thousand sights of beauty.“It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically restedfrom labour—the old man played on his guitar, and the childrenlistened to him—that I observed the countenance of Felix wasmelancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently, and once his fatherpaused in his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he inquiredthe cause of his son’s sorrow. Felix replied in a cheerful accent, andthe old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door.“It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a guide.The lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick blackveil. Agatha asked a question, to which the stranger only replied bypronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix. Her voice wasmusical but unlike that of either of my friends. On hearing this word,Felix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up herveil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression. Herhair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes weredark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regularproportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged witha lovely pink.“Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait ofsorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree ofecstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; hiseyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment Ithought him as beautiful as the stranger. She appeared affected bydifferent feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she heldout her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously and called her, aswell as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian. She did not appear tounderstand him, but smiled. He assisted her to dismount, anddismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage. Someconversation took place between him and his father, and the youngstranger knelt at the old man’s feet and would have kissed his hand,but he raised her and embraced her affectionately.“I soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate soundsand appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understoodby nor herself understood the cottagers. They made many signs which Idid not comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladnessthrough the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates themorning mists. Felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles ofdelight welcomed his Arabian. Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissedthe hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to her brother, madesigns which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until shecame. Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances,expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend. Presently Ifound, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the strangerrepeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language;and the idea instantly occurred to me that I should make use of thesame instructions to the same end. The stranger learned about twentywords at the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those which I hadbefore understood, but I profited by the others.“As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early. When theyseparated Felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said, ‘Good nightsweet Safie.’ He sat up much longer, conversing with his father, andby the frequent repetition of her name I conjectured that their lovelyguest was the subject of their conversation. I ardently desired tounderstand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but foundit utterly impossible.“The next morning Felix went out to his work, and after the usualoccupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of theold man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancinglybeautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from myeyes. She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling ordying away like a nightingale of the woods.“When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at firstdeclined it. She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it insweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. The oldman appeared enraptured and said some words which Agatha endeavoured toexplain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that shebestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.“The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alterationthat joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends.Safie was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in theknowledge of language, so that in two months I began to comprehend mostof the words uttered by my protectors.“In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, andthe green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to thescent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods;the sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnalrambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerablyshortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun, for I neverventured abroad during daylight, fearful of meeting with the sametreatment I had formerly endured in the first village which I entered.“My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedilymaster the language; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly thanthe Arabian, who understood very little and conversed in brokenaccents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word thatwas spoken.“While I improved in speech, I also learned the science of letters asit was taught to the stranger, and this opened before me a wide fieldfor wonder and delight.“The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney’s _Ruinsof Empires_. I should not have understood the purport of this book had notFelix, in reading it, given very minute explanations. He had chosen thiswork, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of theEastern authors. Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of historyand a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gaveme an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the differentnations of the earth. I heard of the slothful Asiatics, of the stupendousgenius and mental activity of the Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtueof the early Romans—of their subsequent degenerating—of thedecline of that mighty empire, of chivalry, Christianity, and kings. I heardof the discovery of the American hemisphere and wept with Safie over thehapless fate of its original inhabitants.“These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. Wasman, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet sovicious and base? He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evilprinciple and at another as all that can be conceived of noble andgodlike. To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honourthat can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many onrecord have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition moreabject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm. For a long time Icould not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, oreven why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details ofvice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust andloathing.“Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me.While I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon theArabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me. Iheard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalidpoverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood.“The words induced me to turn towards myself. I learned that thepossessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high andunsullied descent united with riches. A man might be respected withonly one of these advantages, but without either he was considered,except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed towaste his powers for the profits of the chosen few! And what was I? Ofmy creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew that Ipossessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. I was, besides,endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not evenof the same nature as man. I was more agile than they and couldsubsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold withless injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs. When I lookedaround I saw and heard of none like me. Was I, then, a monster, a blotupon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?“I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflictedupon me; I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased withknowledge. Oh, that I had for ever remained in my native wood, norknown nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat!“Of what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings to the mind when ithas once seized on it like a lichen on the rock. I wished sometimes toshake off all thought and feeling, but I learned that there was but onemeans to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death—a statewhich I feared yet did not understand. I admired virtue and goodfeelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of mycottagers, but I was shut out from intercourse with them, exceptthrough means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen andunknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had ofbecoming one among my fellows. The gentle words of Agatha and theanimated smiles of the charming Arabian were not for me. The mildexhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the lovedFelix were not for me. Miserable, unhappy wretch!“Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply. I heard of thedifference of sexes, and the birth and growth of children, how thefather doted on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of theolder child, how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped upin the precious charge, how the mind of youth expanded and gainedknowledge, of brother, sister, and all the various relationships whichbind one human being to another in mutual bonds.“But where were my friends and relations? No father had watched myinfant days, no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or ifthey had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which Idistinguished nothing. From my earliest remembrance I had been as Ithen was in height and proportion. I had never yet seen a beingresembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me. What was I? Thequestion again recurred, to be answered only with groans.“I will soon explain to what these feelings tended, but allow me now toreturn to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such variousfeelings of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminatedin additional love and reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, inan innocent, half-painful self-deceit, to call them).”Chapter 14“Some time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends. It wasone which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfoldingas it did a number of circumstances, each interesting and wonderful toone so utterly inexperienced as I was.“The name of the old man was De Lacey. He was descended from a goodfamily in France, where he had lived for many years in affluence,respected by his superiors and beloved by his equals. His son was bredin the service of his country, and Agatha had ranked with ladies of thehighest distinction. A few months before my arrival they had lived ina large and luxurious city called Paris, surrounded by friends andpossessed of every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of intellect, ortaste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford.“The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin. He was aTurkish merchant and had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for somereason which I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government.He was seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived fromConstantinople to join him. He was tried and condemned to death. Theinjustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant;and it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crimealleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation.“Felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror andindignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of thecourt. He made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him and thenlooked around for the means. After many fruitless attempts to gainadmittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in anunguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of theunfortunate Muhammadan, who, loaded with chains, waited in despair theexecution of the barbarous sentence. Felix visited the grate at nightand made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour. The Turk,amazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his delivererby promises of reward and wealth. Felix rejected his offers withcontempt, yet when he saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visither father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude, theyouth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possesseda treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard.“The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had madeon the heart of Felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely inhis interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as heshould be conveyed to a place of safety. Felix was too delicate toaccept this offer, yet he looked forward to the probability of theevent as to the consummation of his happiness.“During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward forthe escape of the merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by severalletters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means toexpress her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an oldman, a servant of her father who understood French. She thanked him inthe most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent, andat the same time she gently deplored her own fate.“I have copies of these letters, for I found means, during my residencein the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letterswere often in the hands of Felix or Agatha. Before I depart I willgive them to you; they will prove the truth of my tale; but at present,as the sun is already far declined, I shall only have time to repeatthe substance of them to you.“Safie related that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and made aslave by the Turks; recommended by her beauty, she had won the heart ofthe father of Safie, who married her. The young girl spoke in high andenthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in freedom, spurned thebondage to which she was now reduced. She instructed her daughter inthe tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers ofintellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the femalefollowers of Muhammad. This lady died, but her lessons were indeliblyimpressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of againreturning to Asia and being immured within the walls of a harem,allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill-suited tothe temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a nobleemulation for virtue. The prospect of marrying a Christian andremaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank insociety was enchanting to her.“The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed, but on the nightprevious to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distantmany leagues from Paris. Felix had procured passports in the name ofhis father, sister, and himself. He had previously communicated hisplan to the former, who aided the deceit by quitting his house, underthe pretence of a journey and concealed himself, with his daughter, inan obscure part of Paris.“Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons and across MontCenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourableopportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions.“Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of hisdeparture, before which time the Turk renewed his promise that sheshould be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them inexpectation of that event; and in the meantime he enjoyed the societyof the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderestaffection. They conversed with one another through the means of aninterpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and Safiesang to him the divine airs of her native country.“The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopesof the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far otherplans. He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to aChristian, but he feared the resentment of Felix if he should appearlukewarm, for he knew that he was still in the power of his delivererif he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which theyinhabited. He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabledto prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, andsecretly to take his daughter with him when he departed. His planswere facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris.“The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of theirvictim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer. Theplot of Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha werethrown into prison. The news reached Felix and roused him from hisdream of pleasure. His blind and aged father and his gentle sister layin a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society ofher whom he loved. This idea was torture to him. He quickly arrangedwith the Turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunityfor escape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as aboarder at a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian,he hastened to Paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of thelaw, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding.“He did not succeed. They remained confined for five months before thetrial took place, the result of which deprived them of their fortuneand condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country.“They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where Idiscovered them. Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, forwhom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, ondiscovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin,became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted Italy withhis daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money to aid him,as he said, in some plan of future maintenance.“Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix and renderedhim, when I first saw him, the most miserable of his family. He couldhave endured poverty, and while this distress had been the meed of hisvirtue, he gloried in it; but the ingratitude of the Turk and the lossof his beloved Safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable. Thearrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul.“When the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his wealthand rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of herlover, but to prepare to return to her native country. The generousnature of Safie was outraged by this command; she attempted toexpostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating histyrannical mandate.“A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter’s apartment and toldher hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghornhad been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to theFrench government; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him toConstantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours. Heintended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidentialservant, to follow at her leisure with the greater part of hisproperty, which had not yet arrived at Leghorn.“When alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that itwould become her to pursue in this emergency. A residence in Turkeywas abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike averseto it. By some papers of her father which fell into her hands sheheard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot wherehe then resided. She hesitated some time, but at length she formed herdetermination. Taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and asum of money, she quitted Italy with an attendant, a native of Leghorn,but who understood the common language of Turkey, and departed forGermany.“She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottageof De Lacey, when her attendant fell dangerously ill. Safie nursed herwith the most devoted affection, but the poor girl died, and theArabian was left alone, unacquainted with the language of the countryand utterly ignorant of the customs of the world. She fell, however,into good hands. The Italian had mentioned the name of the spot forwhich they were bound, and after her death the woman of the house inwhich they had lived took care that Safie should arrive in safety atthe cottage of her lover.”Chapter 15“Such was the history of my beloved cottagers. It impressed me deeply.I learned, from the views of social life which it developed, to admiretheir virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind.“As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil, benevolence andgenerosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire tobecome an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualitieswere called forth and displayed. But in giving an account of theprogress of my intellect, I must not omit a circumstance which occurredin the beginning of the month of August of the same year.“One night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where Icollected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors, I found onthe ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress andsome books. I eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel. Fortunately the books were written in the language, the elements of which Ihad acquired at the cottage; they consisted of _Paradise Lost_, a volumeof _Plutarch’s Lives_, and the _Sorrows of Werter_. Thepossession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I now continuallystudied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends wereemployed in their ordinary occupations.“I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books. They producedin me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised meto ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. Inthe _Sorrows of Werter_, besides the interest of its simple and affectingstory, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown uponwhat had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it anever-ending source of speculation and astonishment. The gentle anddomestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments andfeelings, which had for their object something out of self, accordedwell with my experience among my protectors and with the wants whichwere for ever alive in my own bosom. But I thought Werter himself amore divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his charactercontained no pretension, but it sank deep. The disquisitions upondeath and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder. I did notpretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towardsthe opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without preciselyunderstanding it.“As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings andcondition. I found myself similar yet at the same time strangelyunlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation Iwas a listener. I sympathised with and partly understood them, but Iwas unformed in mind; I was dependent on none and related to none.‘The path of my departure was free,’ and there was none to lament myannihilation. My person was hideous and my stature gigantic. What didthis mean? Who was I? What was I? Whence did I come? What was mydestination? These questions continually recurred, but I was unable tosolve them.“The volume of _Plutarch’s Lives_ which I possessed contained thehistories of the first founders of the ancient republics. This bookhad a far different effect upon me from the _Sorrows of Werter_. Ilearned from Werter’s imaginations despondency and gloom, but Plutarchtaught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of myown reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages. Manythings I read surpassed my understanding and experience. I had a veryconfused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers,and boundless seas. But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns andlarge assemblages of men. The cottage of my protectors had been theonly school in which I had studied human nature, but this bookdeveloped new and mightier scenes of action. I read of men concernedin public affairs, governing or massacring their species. I felt thegreatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, asfar as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as theywere, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone. Induced by thesefeelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa,Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus. Thepatriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take afirm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity hadbeen made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I shouldhave been imbued with different sensations.“But _Paradise Lost_ excited different and far deeper emotions. I readit, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, asa true history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that thepicture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable ofexciting. I often referred the several situations, as their similaritystruck me, to my own. Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link toany other being in existence; but his state was far different from minein every other respect. He had come forth from the hands of God aperfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care ofhis Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge frombeings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone.Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, foroften, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bittergall of envy rose within me.“Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings. Soonafter my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket ofthe dress which I had taken from your laboratory. At first I hadneglected them, but now that I was able to decipher the characters inwhich they were written, I began to study them with diligence. It wasyour journal of the four months that preceded my creation. Youminutely described in these papers every step you took in the progressof your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domesticoccurrences. You doubtless recollect these papers. Here they are.Everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursedorigin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstanceswhich produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odiousand loathsome person is given, in language which painted your ownhorrors and rendered mine indelible. I sickened as I read. ‘Hatefulday when I received life!’ I exclaimed in agony. ‘Accursed creator!Why did you form a monster so hideous that even _you_ turned from me indisgust? God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his ownimage; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from thevery resemblance. Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admireand encourage him, but I am solitary and abhorred.’“These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude;but when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable andbenevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they shouldbecome acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they wouldcompassionate me and overlook my personal deformity. Could they turnfrom their door one, however monstrous, who solicited their compassionand friendship? I resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every wayto fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate. Ipostponed this attempt for some months longer, for the importanceattached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail.Besides, I found that my understanding improved so much with everyday’s experience that I was unwilling to commence this undertakinguntil a few more months should have added to my sagacity.“Several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage. Thepresence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and I alsofound that a greater degree of plenty reigned there. Felix and Agathaspent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted intheir labours by servants. They did not appear rich, but they werecontented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful, whilemine became every day more tumultuous. Increase of knowledge onlydiscovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was. Icherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when I beheld my personreflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frailimage and that inconstant shade.“I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trialwhich in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed mythoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, anddared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with myfeelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breathedsmiles of consolation. But it was all a dream; no Eve soothed mysorrows nor shared my thoughts; I was alone. I remembered Adam’ssupplication to his Creator. But where was mine? He had abandoned me,and in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him.“Autumn passed thus. I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decayand fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance ithad worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon. Yet I didnot heed the bleakness of the weather; I was better fitted by myconformation for the endurance of cold than heat. But my chiefdelights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gayapparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with more attentiontowards the cottagers. Their happiness was not decreased by theabsence of summer. They loved and sympathised with one another; andtheir joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by thecasualties that took place around them. The more I saw of them, thegreater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; myheart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures; to seetheir sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmostlimit of my ambition. I dared not think that they would turn them fromme with disdain and horror. The poor that stopped at their door werenever driven away. I asked, it is true, for greater treasures than alittle food or rest: I required kindness and sympathy; but I did notbelieve myself utterly unworthy of it.“The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had takenplace since I awoke into life. My attention at this time was solelydirected towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of myprotectors. I revolved many projects, but that on which I finallyfixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone.I had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of myperson was the chief object of horror with those who had formerlybeheld me. My voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; Ithought, therefore, that if in the absence of his children I could gainthe good will and mediation of the old De Lacey, I might by his meansbe tolerated by my younger protectors.“One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the groundand diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha,and Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his owndesire, was left alone in the cottage. When his children had departed,he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, moresweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before. At first hiscountenance was illuminated with pleasure, but as he continued,thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside theinstrument, he sat absorbed in reflection.“My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, whichwould decide my hopes or realise my fears. The servants were gone to aneighbouring fair. All was silent in and around the cottage; it was anexcellent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, mylimbs failed me and I sank to the ground. Again I rose, and exertingall the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I hadplaced before my hovel to conceal my retreat. The fresh air revivedme, and with renewed determination I approached the door of theircottage.“I knocked. ‘Who is there?’ said the old man. ‘Come in.’“I entered. ‘Pardon this intrusion,’ said I; ‘I ama traveller in want of a little rest; you would greatly oblige me if youwould allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire.’“‘Enter,’ said De Lacey, ‘and I will try in whatmanner I can to relieve your wants; but, unfortunately, my children arefrom home, and as I am blind, I am afraid I shall find it difficult toprocure food for you.’“‘Do not trouble yourself, my kind host; I have food; it iswarmth and rest only that I need.’“I sat down, and a silence ensued. I knew that every minute wasprecious to me, yet I remained irresolute in what manner to commencethe interview, when the old man addressed me.‘By your language, stranger, I suppose you are my countryman; are youFrench?’“‘No; but I was educated by a French family and understand thatlanguage only. I am now going to claim the protection of some friends,whom I sincerely love, and of whose favour I have some hopes.’“‘Are they Germans?’“‘No, they are French. But let us change the subject. I am anunfortunate and deserted creature, I look around and I have no relationor friend upon earth. These amiable people to whom I go have neverseen me and know little of me. I am full of fears, for if I failthere, I am an outcast in the world for ever.’“‘Do not despair. To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate, butthe hearts of men, when unprejudiced by any obvious self-interest, arefull of brotherly love and charity. Rely, therefore, on your hopes;and if these friends are good and amiable, do not despair.’“‘They are kind—they are the most excellent creatures in the world;but, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me. I have gooddispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degreebeneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes, and where theyought to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold only a detestablemonster.’“‘That is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless, cannotyou undeceive them?’“‘I am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account that Ifeel so many overwhelming terrors. I tenderly love these friends; Ihave, unknown to them, been for many months in the habits of dailykindness towards them; but they believe that I wish to injure them, andit is that prejudice which I wish to overcome.’“‘Where do these friends reside?’“‘Near this spot.’“The old man paused and then continued, ‘If you will unreservedlyconfide to me the particulars of your tale, I perhaps may be of use inundeceiving them. I am blind and cannot judge of your countenance, butthere is something in your words which persuades me that you aresincere. I am poor and an exile, but it will afford me true pleasureto be in any way serviceable to a human creature.’“‘Excellent man! I thank you and accept your generous offer. Youraise me from the dust by this kindness; and I trust that, by your aid,I shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellowcreatures.’“‘Heaven forbid! Even if you were really criminal, for that can onlydrive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue. I also amunfortunate; I and my family have been condemned, although innocent;judge, therefore, if I do not feel for your misfortunes.’“‘How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor? From your lipsfirst have I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; I shallbe for ever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of successwith those friends whom I am on the point of meeting.’“‘May I know the names and residence of those friends?’“I paused. This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was torob me of or bestow happiness on me for ever. I struggled vainly forfirmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all myremaining strength; I sank on the chair and sobbed aloud. At thatmoment I heard the steps of my younger protectors. I had not a momentto lose, but seizing the hand of the old man, I cried, ‘Now is thetime! Save and protect me! You and your family are the friends whom Iseek. Do not you desert me in the hour of trial!’“‘Great God!’ exclaimed the old man. ‘Who are you?’“At that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix, Safie, andAgatha entered. Who can describe their horror and consternation onbeholding me? Agatha fainted, and Safie, unable to attend to herfriend, rushed out of the cottage. Felix darted forward, and withsupernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung, ina transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground and struck me violentlywith a stick. I could have torn him limb from limb, as the lion rendsthe antelope. But my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness, andI refrained. I saw him on the point of repeating his blow, when,overcome by pain and anguish, I quitted the cottage, and in the generaltumult escaped unperceived to my hovel.”Chapter 16“Cursed, cursed creator! Why did I live? Why, in that instant, did Inot extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonlybestowed? I know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; myfeelings were those of rage and revenge. I could with pleasure havedestroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself withtheir shrieks and misery.“When night came I quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood; andnow, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to myanguish in fearful howlings. I was like a wild beast that had brokenthe toils, destroying the objects that obstructed me and rangingthrough the wood with a stag-like swiftness. Oh! What a miserablenight I passed! The cold stars shone in mockery, and the bare treeswaved their branches above me; now and then the sweet voice of a birdburst forth amidst the universal stillness. All, save I, were at restor in enjoyment; I, like the arch-fiend, bore a hell within me, andfinding myself unsympathised with, wished to tear up the trees, spreadhavoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyedthe ruin.“But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I becamefatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass inthe sick impotence of despair. There was none among the myriads of menthat existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindnesstowards my enemies? No; from that moment I declared everlasting waragainst the species, and more than all, against him who had formed meand sent me forth to this insupportable misery.“The sun rose; I heard the voices of men and knew that it wasimpossible to return to my retreat during that day. Accordingly I hidmyself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hoursto reflection on my situation.“The pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to somedegree of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at thecottage, I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in myconclusions. I had certainly acted imprudently. It was apparent thatmy conversation had interested the father in my behalf, and I was afool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children. Iought to have familiarised the old De Lacey to me, and by degrees tohave discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should havebeen prepared for my approach. But I did not believe my errors to beirretrievable, and after much consideration I resolved to return to thecottage, seek the old man, and by my representations win him to myparty.“These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profoundsleep; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited bypeaceful dreams. The horrible scene of the preceding day was for everacting before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged Felixtearing me from his father’s feet. I awoke exhausted, and finding thatit was already night, I crept forth from my hiding-place, and went insearch of food.“When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards thewell-known path that conducted to the cottage. All there was at peace.I crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of theaccustomed hour when the family arose. That hour passed, the sunmounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers did not appear. Itrembled violently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune. The insideof the cottage was dark, and I heard no motion; I cannot describe theagony of this suspense.“Presently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the cottage, theyentered into conversation, using violent gesticulations; but I did notunderstand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country,which differed from that of my protectors. Soon after, however, Felixapproached with another man; I was surprised, as I knew that he had notquitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover fromhis discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances.“‘Do you consider,’ said his companion to him,‘that you will be obliged to pay three months’ rent and to losethe produce of your garden? I do not wish to take any unfair advantage, andI beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of yourdetermination.’“‘It is utterly useless,’ replied Felix; ‘we cannever again inhabit your cottage. The life of my father is in the greatestdanger, owing to the dreadful circumstance that I have related. My wife andmy sister will never recover from their horror. I entreat you not to reasonwith me any more. Take possession of your tenement and let me fly from thisplace.’“Felix trembled violently as he said this. He and his companionentered the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and thendeparted. I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more.“I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state ofutter and stupid despair. My protectors had departed and had brokenthe only link that held me to the world. For the first time thefeelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive tocontrol them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, Ibent my mind towards injury and death. When I thought of my friends,of the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and theexquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished and a gush oftears somewhat soothed me. But again when I reflected that they hadspurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable toinjure anything human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects. Asnight advanced, I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage,and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden,I waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence myoperations.“As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and quicklydispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast torealong like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in myspirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection. I lighted thedry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage,my eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moonnearly touched. A part of its orb was at length hid, and I waved mybrand; it sank, and with a loud scream I fired the straw, and heath,and bushes, which I had collected. The wind fanned the fire, and thecottage was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to it andlicked it with their forked and destroying tongues.“As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part ofthe habitation, I quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods.“And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps? Iresolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hatedand despised, every country must be equally horrible. At length thethought of you crossed my mind. I learned from your papers that youwere my father, my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitnessthan to him who had given me life? Among the lessons that Felix hadbestowed upon Safie, geography had not been omitted; I had learned fromthese the relative situations of the different countries of the earth.You had mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town, and towardsthis place I resolved to proceed.“But how was I to direct myself? I knew that I must travel in asouthwesterly direction to reach my destination, but the sun was myonly guide. I did not know the names of the towns that I was to passthrough, nor could I ask information from a single human being; but Idid not despair. From you only could I hope for succour, althoughtowards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred. Unfeeling,heartless creator! You had endowed me with perceptions and passionsand then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind.But on you only had I any claim for pity and redress, and from you Idetermined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain fromany other being that wore the human form.“My travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense. It waslate in autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided.I travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of ahuman being. Nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless;rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surfaceof the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter. Oh,earth! How often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being! Themildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to galland bitterness. The nearer I approached to your habitation, the moredeeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart. Snowfell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not. A few incidentsnow and then directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; but Ioften wandered wide from my path. The agony of my feelings allowed meno respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery couldnot extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrivedon the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmthand the earth again began to look green, confirmed in an especialmanner the bitterness and horror of my feelings.“I generally rested during the day and travelled only when I wassecured by night from the view of man. One morning, however, findingthat my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journeyafter the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring,cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess ofthe air. I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had longappeared dead, revive within me. Half surprised by the novelty ofthese sensations, I allowed myself to be borne away by them, andforgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy. Soft tearsagain bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes withthankfulness towards the blessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon me.“I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to itsboundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which manyof the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring.Here I paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heardthe sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shadeof a cypress. I was scarcely hid when a young girl came runningtowards the spot where I was concealed, laughing, as if she ran fromsomeone in sport. She continued her course along the precipitous sidesof the river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into therapid stream. I rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour,from the force of the current, saved her and dragged her to shore. Shewas senseless, and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restoreanimation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic,who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled. Onseeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms,hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood. I followed speedily, Ihardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun,which he carried, at my body and fired. I sank to the ground, and myinjurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood.“This was then the reward of my benevolence! I had saved a human beingfrom destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserablepain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone. The feelings ofkindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few momentsbefore gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth. Inflamed bypain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind. But theagony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I fainted.“For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring tocure the wound which I had received. The ball had entered my shoulder,and I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at anyrate I had no means of extracting it. My sufferings were augmentedalso by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of theirinfliction. My daily vows rose for revenge—a deep and deadly revenge,such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I hadendured.“After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey. Thelabours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun orgentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery which insulted mydesolate state and made me feel more painfully that I was not made forthe enjoyment of pleasure.“But my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time Ireached the environs of Geneva.“It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place amongthe fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I should applyto you. I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy toenjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun settingbehind the stupendous mountains of Jura.“At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection,which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who camerunning into the recess I had chosen, with all the sportiveness ofinfancy. Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me that thislittle creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to haveimbibed a horror of deformity. If, therefore, I could seize him andeducate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate inthis peopled earth.“Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed and drew himtowards me. As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands beforehis eyes and uttered a shrill scream; I drew his hand forcibly from hisface and said, ‘Child, what is the meaning of this? I do not intend tohurt you; listen to me.’“He struggled violently. ‘Let me go,’ he cried;‘monster! Ugly wretch! You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces. Youare an ogre. Let me go, or I will tell my papa.’“‘Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.’“‘Hideous monster! Let me go. My papa is a syndic—he is M.Frankenstein—he will punish you. You dare not keep me.’“‘Frankenstein! you belong then to my enemy—to him towards whom I havesworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.’“The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carrieddespair to my heart; I grasped his throat to silence him, and in amoment he lay dead at my feet.“I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hellishtriumph; clapping my hands, I exclaimed, ‘I too can create desolation;my enemy is not invulnerable; this death will carry despair to him, anda thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him.’“As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on hisbreast. I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman. In spiteof my malignity, it softened and attracted me. For a few moments Igazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and herlovely lips; but presently my rage returned; I remembered that I wasfor ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures couldbestow and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would, inregarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to oneexpressive of disgust and affright.“Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage? I onlywonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations inexclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind and perish in theattempt to destroy them.“While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I hadcommitted the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, Ientered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty. A woman wassleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as herwhose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in theloveliness of youth and health. Here, I thought, is one of those whosejoy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me. And then I bent overher and whispered, ‘Awake, fairest, thy lover is near—he who wouldgive his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; mybeloved, awake!’“The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me. Should sheindeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer? Thuswould she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me.The thought was madness; it stirred the fiend within me—not I, butshe, shall suffer; the murder I have committed because I am for everrobbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone. The crime hadits source in her; be hers the punishment! Thanks to the lessons ofFelix and the sanguinary laws of man, I had learned now to workmischief. I bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one ofthe folds of her dress. She moved again, and I fled.“For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place,sometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world andits miseries for ever. At length I wandered towards these mountains,and have ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burningpassion which you alone can gratify. We may not part until you havepromised to comply with my requisition. I am alone and miserable; manwill not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myselfwould not deny herself to me. My companion must be of the same speciesand have the same defects. This being you must create.”Chapter 17The being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in theexpectation of a reply. But I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable toarrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of hisproposition. He continued,“You must create a female for me with whom I can live in theinterchange of those sympathies necessary for my being. This you alonecan do, and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse toconcede.”The latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that haddied away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, andas he said this I could no longer suppress the rage that burned withinme.“I do refuse it,” I replied; “and no torture shall ever extort aconsent from me. You may render me the most miserable of men, but youshall never make me base in my own eyes. Shall I create another likeyourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world. Begone! Ihave answered you; you may torture me, but I will never consent.”“You are in the wrong,” replied the fiend; “and insteadof threatening, I am content to reason with you. I am malicious because Iam miserable. Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind? You, my creator,would tear me to pieces and triumph; remember that, and tell me why Ishould pity man more than he pities me? You would not call it murder if youcould precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts and destroy my frame, thework of your own hands. Shall I respect man when he condemns me? Let himlive with me in the interchange of kindness, and instead of injury I wouldbestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance.But that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to ourunion. Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery. I willrevenge my injuries; if I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear, andchiefly towards you my arch-enemy, because my creator, do I swearinextinguishable hatred. Have a care; I will work at your destruction, norfinish until I desolate your heart, so that you shall curse the hour ofyour birth.”A fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkledinto contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presentlyhe calmed himself and proceeded—“I intended to reason. This passion is detrimental to me, for you donot reflect that _you_ are the cause of its excess. If any being feltemotions of benevolence towards me, I should return them a hundred and ahundredfold; for that one creature’s sake I would make peace with thewhole kind! But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realised.What I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a creature ofanother sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but itis all that I can receive, and it shall content me. It is true, we shall bemonsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be moreattached to one another. Our lives will not be happy, but they will beharmless and free from the misery I now feel. Oh! My creator, make mehappy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit! Let me see that Iexcite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me myrequest!”I was moved. I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequencesof my consent, but I felt that there was some justice in his argument.His tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creatureof fine sensations, and did I not as his maker owe him all the portionof happiness that it was in my power to bestow? He saw my change offeeling and continued,“If you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever seeus again; I will go to the vast wilds of South America. My food is notthat of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite;acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment. My companion willbe of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare.We shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as onman and will ripen our food. The picture I present to you is peacefuland human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in thewantonness of power and cruelty. Pitiless as you have been towards me,I now see compassion in your eyes; let me seize the favourable momentand persuade you to promise what I so ardently desire.”“You propose,” replied I, “to fly from the habitations ofman, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be youronly companions. How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man,persevere in this exile? You will return and again seek their kindness, andyou will meet with their detestation; your evil passions will be renewed,and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction.This may not be; cease to argue the point, for I cannot consent.”“How inconstant are your feelings! But a moment ago you were moved bymy representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints?I swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me, thatwith the companion you bestow, I will quit the neighbourhood of man anddwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of places. My evil passionswill have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy! My life will flow quietlyaway, and in my dying moments I shall not curse my maker.”His words had a strange effect upon me. I compassionated him andsometimes felt a wish to console him, but when I looked upon him, whenI saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened and myfeelings were altered to those of horror and hatred. I tried to stiflethese sensations; I thought that as I could not sympathise with him, Ihad no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness whichwas yet in my power to bestow.“You swear,” I said, “to be harmless; but have you notalready shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrustyou? May not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph byaffording a wider scope for your revenge?”“How is this? I must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer. IfI have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion;the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shallbecome a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant. My vicesare the children of a forced solitude that I abhor, and my virtues willnecessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal. I shall feelthe affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain ofexistence and events from which I am now excluded.”I paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the variousarguments which he had employed. I thought of the promise of virtues whichhe had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blightof all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors hadmanifested towards him. His power and threats were not omitted in mycalculations; a creature who could exist in the ice-caves of the glaciersand hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipiceswas a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with. After along pause of reflection I concluded that the justice due both to him andmy fellow creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his request.Turning to him, therefore, I said,“I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe for ever,and every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shalldeliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile.”“I swear,” he cried, “by the sun, and by the blue sky ofheaven, and by the fire of love that burns my heart, that if you grant myprayer, while they exist you shall never behold me again. Depart to yourhome and commence your labours; I shall watch their progress withunutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready I shallappear.”Saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change inmy sentiments. I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed thanthe flight of an eagle, and quickly lost among the undulations of thesea of ice.His tale had occupied the whole day, and the sun was upon the verge ofthe horizon when he departed. I knew that I ought to hasten my descenttowards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but myheart was heavy, and my steps slow. The labour of winding among thelittle paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as I advancedperplexed me, occupied as I was by the emotions which the occurrencesof the day had produced. Night was far advanced when I came to thehalfway resting-place and seated myself beside the fountain. The starsshone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pinesrose before me, and every here and there a broken tree lay on theground; it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strangethoughts within me. I wept bitterly, and clasping my hands in agony, Iexclaimed, “Oh! stars and clouds and winds, ye are all about to mockme; if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become asnought; but if not, depart, depart, and leave me in darkness.”These were wild and miserable thoughts, but I cannot describe to youhow the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how Ilistened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on itsway to consume me.Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I took norest, but returned immediately to Geneva. Even in my own heart I couldgive no expression to my sensations—they weighed on me with amountain’s weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them.Thus I returned home, and entering the house, presented myself to thefamily. My haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm, but Ianswered no question, scarcely did I speak. I felt as if I were placedunder a ban—as if I had no right to claim their sympathies—as ifnever more might I enjoy companionship with them. Yet even thus Iloved them to adoration; and to save them, I resolved to dedicatemyself to my most abhorred task. The prospect of such an occupationmade every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream,and that thought only had to me the reality of life.Chapter 18Day after day, week after week, passed away on my return to Geneva; andI could not collect the courage to recommence my work. I feared thevengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome myrepugnance to the task which was enjoined me. I found that I could notcompose a female without again devoting several months to profoundstudy and laborious disquisition. I had heard of some discoverieshaving been made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which wasmaterial to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining myfather’s consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung toevery pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in anundertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute tome. A change indeed had taken place in me; my health, which hadhitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, whenunchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably. Myfather saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughtstowards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy,which every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouringblackness overcast the approaching sunshine. At these moments I tookrefuge in the most perfect solitude. I passed whole days on the lakealone in a little boat, watching the clouds and listening to therippling of the waves, silent and listless. But the fresh air andbright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure, andon my return I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smileand a more cheerful heart.It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father,calling me aside, thus addressed me,“I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your formerpleasures and seem to be returning to yourself. And yet you are stillunhappy and still avoid our society. For some time I was lost inconjecture as to the cause of this, but yesterday an idea struck me,and if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it. Reserve on such apoint would be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on us all.”I trembled violently at his exordium, and my father continued—“I confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to yourmarriage with our dear Elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and thestay of my declining years. You were attached to each other from yourearliest infancy; you studied together, and appeared, in dispositions andtastes, entirely suited to one another. But so blind is the experience ofman that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may haveentirely destroyed it. You, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without anywish that she might become your wife. Nay, you may have met with anotherwhom you may love; and considering yourself as bound in honour toElizabeth, this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appearto feel.”“My dear father, reassure yourself. I love my cousin tenderly andsincerely. I never saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth does, mywarmest admiration and affection. My future hopes and prospects areentirely bound up in the expectation of our union.”“The expression of your sentiments of this subject, my dear Victor,gives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced. If youfeel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may casta gloom over us. But it is this gloom which appears to have taken sostrong a hold of your mind that I wish to dissipate. Tell me,therefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of themarriage. We have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn usfrom that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities. Youare younger; yet I do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competentfortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any futureplans of honour and utility that you may have formed. Do not suppose,however, that I wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay onyour part would cause me any serious uneasiness. Interpret my wordswith candour and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence andsincerity.”I listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapableof offering any reply. I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude ofthoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion. Alas! To methe idea of an immediate union with my Elizabeth was one of horror anddismay. I was bound by a solemn promise which I had not yet fulfilledand dared not break, or if I did, what manifold miseries might notimpend over me and my devoted family! Could I enter into a festivalwith this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to theground? I must perform my engagement and let the monster depart withhis mate before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union fromwhich I expected peace.I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying toEngland or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophersof that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensableuse to me in my present undertaking. The latter method of obtainingthe desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, Ihad an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in myloathsome task in my father’s house while in habits of familiarintercourse with those I loved. I knew that a thousand fearfulaccidents might occur, the slightest of which would disclose a tale tothrill all connected with me with horror. I was aware also that Ishould often lose all self-command, all capacity of hiding theharrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of myunearthly occupation. I must absent myself from all I loved while thusemployed. Once commenced, it would quickly be achieved, and I might berestored to my family in peace and happiness. My promise fulfilled,the monster would depart for ever. Or (so my fond fancy imaged) someaccident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to myslavery for ever.These feelings dictated my answer to my father. I expressed a wish tovisit England, but concealing the true reasons of this request, Iclothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while Iurged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father tocomply. After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy thatresembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to findthat I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey,and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before myreturn, have restored me entirely to myself.The duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, orat most a year, was the period contemplated. One paternal kindprecaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion. Withoutpreviously communicating with me, he had, in concert with Elizabeth,arranged that Clerval should join me at Strasburgh. This interferedwith the solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my task; yet at thecommencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way bean impediment, and truly I rejoiced that thus I should be saved manyhours of lonely, maddening reflection. Nay, Henry might stand betweenme and the intrusion of my foe. If I were alone, would he not at timesforce his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or tocontemplate its progress?To England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my unionwith Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return. My father’sage rendered him extremely averse to delay. For myself, there was onereward I promised myself from my detested toils—one consolation for myunparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when,enfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth andforget the past in my union with her.I now made arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted mewhich filled me with fear and agitation. During my absence I shouldleave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy andunprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by mydeparture. But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go, andwould he not accompany me to England? This imagination was dreadful initself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends.I was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse ofthis might happen. But through the whole period during which I was theslave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses ofthe moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiendwould follow me and exempt my family from the danger of hismachinations.It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my nativecountry. My journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeththerefore acquiesced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea ofmy suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief. It hadbeen her care which provided me a companion in Clerval—and yet a manis blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a woman’ssedulous attention. She longed to bid me hasten my return; a thousandconflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful, silentfarewell.I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardlyknowing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around.I remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected onit, to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go withme. Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautifuland majestic scenes, but my eyes were fixed and unobserving. I couldonly think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupyme whilst they endured.After some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversedmany leagues, I arrived at Strasburgh, where I waited two days forClerval. He came. Alas, how great was the contrast between us! Hewas alive to every new scene, joyful when he saw the beauties of thesetting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a newday. He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape andthe appearances of the sky. “This is what it is to live,” he cried;“now I enjoy existence! But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore areyou desponding and sorrowful!” In truth, I was occupied by gloomythoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the goldensunrise reflected in the Rhine. And you, my friend, would be far moreamused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with aneye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections. I, amiserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue toenjoyment.We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasburgh toRotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London. During thisvoyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns.We stayed a day at Mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure fromStrasburgh, arrived at Mainz. The course of the Rhine below Mainzbecomes much more picturesque. The river descends rapidly and windsbetween hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms. We sawmany ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded byblack woods, high and inaccessible. This part of the Rhine, indeed,presents a singularly variegated landscape. In one spot you viewrugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, withthe dark Rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory,flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering riverand populous towns occupy the scene.We travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourersas we glided down the stream. Even I, depressed in mind, and my spiritscontinually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I lay at thebottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed todrink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger. And if thesewere my sensations, who can describe those of Henry? He felt as if he hadbeen transported to Fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted byman. “I have seen,” he said, “the most beautiful scenesof my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where thesnowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting blackand impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearancewere it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gayappearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind toreup whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must beon the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain,where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche andwhere their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of thenightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud;but this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders. Themountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is acharm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled.Look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on theisland, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and nowthat group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that villagehalf hid in the recess of the mountain. Oh, surely the spirit that inhabitsand guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those whopile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains ofour own country.”Clerval! Beloved friend! Even now it delights me to record your words andto dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving. He was abeing formed in the “very poetry of nature.” His wild andenthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart. Hissoul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of thatdevoted and wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach us to look for onlyin the imagination. But even human sympathies were not sufficient tosatisfy his eager mind. The scenery of external nature, which others regardonly with admiration, he loved with ardour:———The sounding cataractHaunted him like a passion: the tall rock,The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,Their colours and their forms, were then to himAn appetite; a feeling, and a love,That had no need of a remoter charm,By thought supplied, or any interestUnborrow’d from the eye.[Wordsworth’s “Tintern Abbey”.]And where does he now exist? Is this gentle and lovely being lostfor ever? Has this mind, so replete with ideas, imaginations fancifuland magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on thelife of its creator;—has this mind perished? Does it now only existin my memory? No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, andbeaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits andconsoles your unhappy friend.Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slighttribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart,overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates. I willproceed with my tale.Beyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; and we resolved topost the remainder of our way, for the wind was contrary and the stream ofthe river was too gentle to aid us.Our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery, but wearrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England.It was on a clear morning, in the latter days of December, that I first sawthe white cliffs of Britain. The banks of the Thames presented a new scene;they were flat but fertile, and almost every town was marked by theremembrance of some story. We saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the SpanishArmada, Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich—places which I had heardof even in my country.At length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St. Paul’s toweringabove all, and the Tower famed in English history.Chapter 19London was our present point of rest; we determined to remain severalmonths in this wonderful and celebrated city. Clerval desired theintercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at thistime, but this was with me a secondary object; I was principallyoccupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for thecompletion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters ofintroduction that I had brought with me, addressed to the mostdistinguished natural philosophers.If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness,it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure. But a blight hadcome over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake ofthe information they might give me on the subject in which my interestwas so terribly profound. Company was irksome to me; when alone, Icould fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice ofHenry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitorypeace. But busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair tomy heart. I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and myfellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William andJustine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filledmy soul with anguish.But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitiveand anxious to gain experience and instruction. The difference ofmanners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source ofinstruction and amusement. He was also pursuing an object he had longhad in view. His design was to visit India, in the belief that he hadin his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he hadtaken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress ofEuropean colonization and trade. In Britain only could he further theexecution of his plan. He was for ever busy, and the only check to hisenjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind. I tried to conceal thisas much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasuresnatural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed byany care or bitter recollection. I often refused to accompany him,alleging another engagement, that I might remain alone. I now alsobegan to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and thiswas to me like the torture of single drops of water continually fallingon the head. Every thought that was devoted to it was an extremeanguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lipsto quiver, and my heart to palpitate.After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person inScotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva. He mentioned thebeauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficientallurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth,where he resided. Clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation, and I,although I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams andall the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places.We had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was nowFebruary. We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards thenorth at the expiration of another month. In this expedition we did notintend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford,Matlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion ofthis tour about the end of July. I packed up my chemical instruments andthe materials I had collected, resolving to finish my labours in someobscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland.We quitted London on the 27th of March and remained a few days atWindsor, rambling in its beautiful forest. This was a new scene to usmountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds ofstately deer were all novelties to us.From thence we proceeded to Oxford. As we entered this city, our mindswere filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transactedthere more than a century and a half before. It was here that CharlesI. had collected his forces. This city had remained faithful to him,after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard ofParliament and liberty. The memory of that unfortunate king and hiscompanions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, andson, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which theymight be supposed to have inhabited. The spirit of elder days found adwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps. If thesefeelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance ofthe city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration.The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almostmagnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadowsof exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters,which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, anddomes, embosomed among aged trees.I enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by thememory of the past and the anticipation of the future. I was formedfor peaceful happiness. During my youthful days discontent nevervisited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by _ennui_, the sight of whatis beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime inthe productions of man could always interest my heart and communicateelasticity to my spirits. But I am a blasted tree; the bolt hasentered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit whatI shall soon cease to be—a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity,pitiable to others and intolerable to myself.We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environsand endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the mostanimating epoch of English history. Our little voyages of discoverywere often prolonged by the successive objects that presentedthemselves. We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and thefield on which that patriot fell. For a moment my soul was elevatedfrom its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideasof liberty and self-sacrifice of which these sights were the monumentsand the remembrancers. For an instant I dared to shake off my chainsand look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eateninto my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into mymiserable self.We left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock, which was our nextplace of rest. The country in the neighbourhood of this villageresembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; buteverything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown ofdistant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of mynative country. We visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinetsof natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the samemanner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix. The latter namemade me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quitMatlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.From Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months inCumberland and Westmorland. I could now almost fancy myself among theSwiss mountains. The little patches of snow which yet lingered on thenorthern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of therocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me. Here also wemade some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me intohappiness. The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater thanmine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he foundin his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could haveimagined himself to have possessed while he associated with hisinferiors. “I could pass my life here,” said he to me; “and amongthese mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine.”But he found that a traveller’s life is one that includes much painamidst its enjoyments. His feelings are for ever on the stretch; andwhen he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quitthat on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which againengages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorlandand conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the periodof our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left themto travel on. For my own part I was not sorry. I had now neglected mypromise for some time, and I feared the effects of the dæmon’sdisappointment. He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeanceon my relatives. This idea pursued me and tormented me at every momentfrom which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace. I waitedfor my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I wasmiserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and Isaw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared toread and ascertain my fate. Sometimes I thought that the fiendfollowed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion.When these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment,but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage ofhis destroyer. I felt as if I had committed some great crime, theconsciousness of which haunted me. I was guiltless, but I had indeeddrawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city mighthave interested the most unfortunate being. Clerval did not like it so wellas Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him.But the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romanticcastle and its environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthur’sSeat, St. Bernard’s Well, and the Pentland Hills, compensated him forthe change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration. But I wasimpatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrew’s, andalong the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us.But I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter intotheir feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; andaccordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotlandalone. “Do you,” said I, “enjoy yourself, and let this be ourrendezvous. I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere withmy motions, I entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a shorttime; and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, morecongenial to your own temper.”Henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased toremonstrate. He entreated me to write often. “I had rather be withyou,” he said, “in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotchpeople, whom I do not know; hasten, then, my dear friend, to return,that I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do inyour absence.”Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot ofScotland and finish my work in solitude. I did not doubt but that themonster followed me and would discover himself to me when I should havefinished, that he might receive his companion.With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one ofthe remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours. It was a placefitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides werecontinually beaten upon by the waves. The soil was barren, scarcelyaffording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for itsinhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbsgave tokens of their miserable fare. Vegetables and bread, when theyindulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured fromthe mainland, which was about five miles distant.On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one ofthese was vacant when I arrived. This I hired. It contained but tworooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserablepenury. The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and thedoor was off its hinges. I ordered it to be repaired, bought somefurniture, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless haveoccasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers beenbenumbed by want and squalid poverty. As it was, I lived ungazed atand unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clotheswhich I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensationsof men.In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening,when the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea tolisten to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet. It was amonotonous yet ever-changing scene. I thought of Switzerland; it wasfar different from this desolate and appalling landscape. Its hillsare covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in theplains. Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and whentroubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a livelyinfant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean.In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, butas I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible andirksome to me. Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter mylaboratory for several days, and at other times I toiled day and nightin order to complete my work. It was, indeed, a filthy process inwhich I was engaged. During my first experiment, a kind ofenthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; mymind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyeswere shut to the horror of my proceedings. But now I went to it incold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands.Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed ina solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention fromthe actual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; Igrew restless and nervous. Every moment I feared to meet mypersecutor. Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearingto raise them lest they should encounter the object which I so muchdreaded to behold. I feared to wander from the sight of my fellowcreatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion.In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerablyadvanced. I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eagerhope, which I dared not trust myself to question but which wasintermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sickenin my bosom.Chapter 20I sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was justrising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment, and Iremained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave mylabour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attentionto it. As I sat, a train of reflection occurred to me which led me toconsider the effects of what I was now doing. Three years before, I wasengaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleledbarbarity had desolated my heart and filled it for ever with the bitterestremorse. I was now about to form another being of whose dispositions I wasalike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than hermate and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness. He hadsworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts, but shehad not; and she, who in all probability was to become a thinking andreasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before hercreation. They might even hate each other; the creature who already livedloathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrencefor it when it came before his eyes in the female form? She also might turnwith disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him,and he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of beingdeserted by one of his own species.Even if they were to leave Europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world,yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the dæmonthirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated uponthe earth who might make the very existence of the species of man acondition precarious and full of terror. Had I right, for my own benefit,to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations? I had before been movedby the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck senseless byhis fiendish threats; but now, for the first time, the wickedness of mypromise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse meas their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace atthe price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race.I trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, I saw bythe light of the moon the dæmon at the casement. A ghastly grinwrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the taskwhich he had allotted to me. Yes, he had followed me in my travels; hehad loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wideand desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim thefulfilment of my promise.As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent ofmalice and treachery. I thought with a sensation of madness on mypromise of creating another like to him, and trembling with passion,tore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged. The wretch saw medestroy the creature on whose future existence he depended forhappiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.I left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my ownheart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, Isought my own apartment. I was alone; none were near me to dissipatethe gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the mostterrible reveries.Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea;it was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all naturereposed under the eye of the quiet moon. A few fishing vessels alonespecked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the soundof voices as the fishermen called to one another. I felt the silence,although I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my earwas suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and aperson landed close to my house.In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some oneendeavoured to open it softly. I trembled from head to foot; I felt apresentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants whodwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensationof helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vainendeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot.Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the dooropened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared. Shutting the door, heapproached me and said in a smothered voice,“You have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that youintend? Do you dare to break your promise? I have endured toil and misery;I left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, amongits willow islands and over the summits of its hills. I have dwelt manymonths in the heaths of England and among the deserts of Scotland. I haveendured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy myhopes?”“Begone! I do break my promise; never will I create another likeyourself, equal in deformity and wickedness.”“Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourselfunworthy of my condescension. Remember that I have power; you believeyourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light ofday will be hateful to you. You are my creator, but I am your master;obey!”“The hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your power isarrived. Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; butthey confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion invice. Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a dæmon whosedelight is in death and wretchedness? Begone! I am firm, and yourwords will only exasperate my rage.”The monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in theimpotence of anger. “Shall each man,” cried he, “find awife for his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone? I hadfeelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn.Man! You may hate, but beware! Your hours will pass in dread and misery,and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness forever. Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of mywretchedness? You can blast my other passions, but revengeremains—revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food! I may die, butfirst you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on yourmisery. Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful. I will watch withthe wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom. Man, you shallrepent of the injuries you inflict.”“Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice.I have declared my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bendbeneath words. Leave me; I am inexorable.”“It is well. I go; but remember, I shall be with you on yourwedding-night.”I started forward and exclaimed, “Villain! Before you sign mydeath-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe.”I would have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house withprecipitation. In a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shotacross the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst thewaves.All was again silent, but his words rang in my ears. I burned with rage topursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean. Iwalked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imaginationconjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me. Why had I notfollowed him and closed with him in mortal strife? But I had suffered himto depart, and he had directed his course towards the mainland. I shudderedto think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge.And then I thought again of his words—“_I will be with you onyour wedding-night._” That, then, was the period fixed for thefulfilment of my destiny. In that hour I should die and at once satisfy andextinguish his malice. The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when Ithought of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow, when sheshould find her lover so barbarously snatched from her, tears, the first Ihad shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fallbefore my enemy without a bitter struggle.The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings becamecalmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks intothe depths of despair. I left the house, the horrid scene of the lastnight’s contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which Ialmost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellowcreatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me. Idesired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is true,but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery. If I returned, it was tobe sacrificed or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of adæmon whom I had myself created.I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all itloved and miserable in the separation. When it became noon, and thesun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deepsleep. I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerveswere agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery. The sleepinto which I now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt asif I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began toreflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still thewords of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appearedlike a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality.The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying myappetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw afishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet;it contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me tojoin him. He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly wherehe was, that letters from the friends he had formed in London desiredhis return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for hisIndian enterprise. He could not any longer delay his departure; but ashis journey to London might be followed, even sooner than he nowconjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much ofmy society on him as I could spare. He besought me, therefore, toleave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we might proceedsouthwards together. This letter in a degree recalled me to life, andI determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days.Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shudderedto reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose Imust enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I musthandle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me. The nextmorning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the doorof my laboratory. The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I haddestroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I hadmangled the living flesh of a human being. I paused to collect myself andthen entered the chamber. With trembling hand I conveyed the instrumentsout of the room, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of mywork to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordinglyput them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying themup, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in themeantime I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging mychemical apparatus.Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken placein my feelings since the night of the appearance of the dæmon. I hadbefore regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, withwhatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a filmhad been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time sawclearly. The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occurto me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did notreflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it. I had resolved inmy own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first madewould be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and Ibanished from my mind every thought that could lead to a differentconclusion.Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting mybasket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore.The scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land,but I sailed away from them. I felt as if I was about the commission of adreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with myfellow creatures. At one time the moon, which had before been clear, wassuddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment ofdarkness and cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling soundas it sank and then sailed away from the spot. The sky became clouded, butthe air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was thenrising. But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensationsthat I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in adirect position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. Clouds hid themoon, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat as itskeel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time Islept soundly.I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke Ifound that the sun had already mounted considerably. The wind was high, andthe waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. I foundthat the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast fromwhich I had embarked. I endeavoured to change my course but quickly foundthat if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled withwater. Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind. Iconfess that I felt a few sensations of terror. I had no compass with meand was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of theworld that the sun was of little benefit to me. I might be driven into thewide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up inthe immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me. I had alreadybeen out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude tomy other sufferings. I looked on the heavens, which were covered by cloudsthat flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; I looked upon thesea; it was to be my grave. “Fiend,” I exclaimed, “yourtask is already fulfilled!” I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, andof Clerval—all left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy hissanguinary and merciless passions. This idea plunged me into a reverie sodespairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point ofclosing before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it.Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards thehorizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea becamefree from breakers. But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sickand hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of highland towards the south.Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I enduredfor several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood ofwarm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we haveof life even in the excess of misery! I constructed another sail with apart of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land. It had awild and rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily perceivedthe traces of cultivation. I saw vessels near the shore and found myselfsuddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man. Icarefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I atlength saw issuing from behind a small promontory. As I was in a state ofextreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a placewhere I could most easily procure nourishment. Fortunately I had money withme. As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a goodharbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpectedescape.As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, severalpeople crowded towards the spot. They seemed much surprised at myappearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whisperedtogether with gestures that at any other time might have produced in mea slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that theyspoke English, and I therefore addressed them in that language. “Mygood friends,” said I, “will you be so kind as to tell me the name ofthis town and inform me where I am?”“You will know that soon enough,” replied a man with a hoarse voice.“Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste,but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you.”I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from astranger, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning andangry countenances of his companions. “Why do you answer me soroughly?” I replied. “Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen toreceive strangers so inhospitably.”“I do not know,” said the man, “what the custom of theEnglish may be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains.”While this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidlyincrease. Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, whichannoyed and in some degree alarmed me. I inquired the way to the inn, butno one replied. I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from thecrowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking manapproaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, “Come, sir, you mustfollow me to Mr. Kirwin’s to give an account of yourself.”“Who is Mr. Kirwin? Why am I to give an account of myself? Is notthis a free country?”“Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks. Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate,and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who wasfound murdered here last night.”This answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself. I was innocent;that could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my conductor in silenceand was led to one of the best houses in the town. I was ready to sink fromfatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politicto rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed intoapprehension or conscious guilt. Little did I then expect the calamity thatwas in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despairall fear of ignominy or death.I must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory ofthe frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to myrecollection.Chapter 21I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an oldbenevolent man with calm and mild manners. He looked upon me, however,with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors,he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.About half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by themagistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before withhis son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o’clock,they observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put infor port. It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they didnot land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek abouttwo miles below. He walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle,and his companions followed him at some distance. As he was proceedingalong the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at hislength on the ground. His companions came up to assist him, and by thelight of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man,who was to all appearance dead. Their first supposition was that it was thecorpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by thewaves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and eventhat the body was not then cold. They instantly carried it to the cottageof an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore itto life. It appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twentyyears of age. He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign ofany violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck.The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, butwhen the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder ofmy brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and amist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair forsupport. The magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drewan unfavourable augury from my manner.The son confirmed his father’s account, but when Daniel Nugent wascalled he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, hesaw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore;and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the sameboat in which I had just landed.A woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the doorof her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hourbefore she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat withonly one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpsewas afterwards found.Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought thebody into her house; it was not cold. They put it into a bed andrubbed it, and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life wasquite gone.Several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreedthat, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, itwas very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had beenobliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed.Besides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the bodyfrom another place, and it was likely that as I did not appear to knowthe shore, I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distanceof the town of —— from the place where I had deposited the corpse.Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken intothe room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed whateffect the sight of it would produce upon me. This idea was probablysuggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of themurder had been described. I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrateand several other persons, to the inn. I could not help being struck by thestrange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but,knowing that I had been conversing with several persons in the island I hadinhabited about the time that the body had been found, I was perfectlytranquil as to the consequences of the affair.I entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin. Howcan I describe my sensations on beholding it? I feel yet parched withhorror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering andagony. The examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses,passed like a dream from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of HenryClerval stretched before me. I gasped for breath, and throwing myself onthe body, I exclaimed, “Have my murderous machinations deprived youalso, my dearest Henry, of life? Two I have already destroyed; othervictims await their destiny; but you, Clerval, my friend, mybenefactor—”The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, andI was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.A fever succeeded to this. I lay for two months on the point of death; myravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself themurderer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval. Sometimes I entreated myattendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I wastormented; and at others I felt the fingers of the monster already graspingmy neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror. Fortunately, as I spokemy native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures andbitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I notsink into forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many bloomingchildren, the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides andyouthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and thenext a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb! Of what materials was Imade that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning ofthe wheel, continually renewed the torture?But I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking froma dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded bygaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon.It was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I hadforgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if somegreat misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked aroundand saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which Iwas, all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly.This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair besideme. She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and hercountenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterisethat class. The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that ofpersons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery. Hertone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English,and the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings.“Are you better now, sir?” said she.I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, “I believe I am;but if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I amstill alive to feel this misery and horror.”“For that matter,” replied the old woman, “if you mean about thegentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if youwere dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you! However, that’s noneof my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I do my dutywith a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same.”I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling aspeech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I feltlanguid and unable to reflect on all that had passed. The whole seriesof my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed itwere all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the forceof reality.As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grewfeverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothedme with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me. Thephysician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman preparedthem for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and theexpression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of thesecond. Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but thehangman who would gain his fee?These were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin hadshown me extreme kindness. He had caused the best room in the prisonto be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he whohad provided a physician and a nurse. It is true, he seldom came tosee me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings ofevery human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies andmiserable ravings of a murderer. He came, therefore, sometimes to seethat I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with longintervals.One day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyeshalf open and my cheeks livid like those in death. I was overcome by gloomand misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire toremain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. At one time Iconsidered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer thepenalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been. Such were mythoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin entered.His countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close tomine and addressed me in French,“I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anything tomake you more comfortable?”“I thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the wholeearth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving.”“I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief toone borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune. But you will, Ihope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence caneasily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.”“That is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, becomethe most miserable of mortals. Persecuted and tortured as I am andhave been, can death be any evil to me?”“Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than thestrange chances that have lately occurred. You were thrown, by somesurprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality,seized immediately, and charged with murder. The first sight that waspresented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in sounaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend acrossyour path.”As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured onthis retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise atthe knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me. I suppose someastonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for Mr. Kirwin hastenedto say,“Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were onyour person were brought me, and I examined them that I might discover sometrace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfortuneand illness. I found several letters, and, among others, one which Idiscovered from its commencement to be from your father. I instantly wroteto Geneva; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter.But you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of anykind.”“This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event;tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I amnow to lament?”“Your family is perfectly well,” said Mr. Kirwin withgentleness; “and someone, a friend, is come to visit you.”I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but itinstantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at mymisery and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement forme to comply with his hellish desires. I put my hand before my eyes,and cried out in agony,“Oh! Take him away! I cannot see him; for God’s sake, do notlet him enter!”Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance. He could not helpregarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said inrather a severe tone,“I should have thought, young man, that the presence of your fatherwould have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.”“My father!” cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxedfrom anguish to pleasure. “Is my father indeed come? How kind, howvery kind! But where is he, why does he not hasten to me?”My change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps hethought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium,and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence. He rose andquitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.Nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than thearrival of my father. I stretched out my hand to him and cried,“Are you then safe—and Elizabeth—and Ernest?”My father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, bydwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise mydesponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode ofcheerfulness. “What a place is this that you inhabit, my son!”said he, looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearanceof the room. “You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seemsto pursue you. And poor Clerval—”The name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation toogreat to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears.“Alas! Yes, my father,” replied I; “some destiny of themost horrible kind hangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely Ishould have died on the coffin of Henry.”We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for theprecarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary thatcould ensure tranquillity. Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted that mystrength should not be exhausted by too much exertion. But theappearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and Igradually recovered my health.As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and blackmelancholy that nothing could dissipate. The image of Clerval wasfor ever before me, ghastly and murdered. More than once the agitationinto which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerousrelapse. Alas! Why did they preserve so miserable and detested alife? It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny, which is nowdrawing to a close. Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish thesethrobbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bearsme to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall alsosink to rest. Then the appearance of death was distant, although thewish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hoursmotionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution thatmight bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.The season of the assizes approached. I had already been three monthsin prison, and although I was still weak and in continual danger of arelapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the countrytown where the court was held. Mr. Kirwin charged himself with everycare of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence. I was sparedthe disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was notbrought before the court that decides on life and death. The grandjury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the OrkneyIslands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnightafter my removal I was liberated from prison.My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of acriminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the freshatmosphere and permitted to return to my native country. I did notparticipate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or apalace were alike hateful. The cup of life was poisoned for ever, andalthough the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, Isaw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated byno light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me. Sometimesthey were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the darkorbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringedthem; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as Ifirst saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt.My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection. He talkedof Geneva, which I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; butthese words only drew deep groans from me. Sometimes, indeed, I felt awish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my belovedcousin or longed, with a devouring _maladie du pays_, to see once morethe blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in earlychildhood; but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which aprison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; andthese fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish anddespair. At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to theexistence I loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilanceto restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence.Yet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finallytriumphed over my selfish despair. It was necessary that I shouldreturn without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of thoseI so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if anychance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again toblast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an end tothe existence of the monstrous image which I had endued with themockery of a soul still more monstrous. My father still desired todelay our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the fatigues of ajourney, for I was a shattered wreck—the shadow of a human being. Mystrength was gone. I was a mere skeleton, and fever night and daypreyed upon my wasted frame.Still, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatience,my father thought it best to yield. We took our passage on board a vesselbound for Havre-de-Grace and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores.It was midnight. I lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening tothe dashing of the waves. I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from mysight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I shouldsoon see Geneva. The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream;yet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detestedshore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forciblythat I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my friend and dearestcompanion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation. Irepassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residingwith my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure forIngolstadt. I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me onto the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night inwhich he first lived. I was unable to pursue the train of thought; athousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly.Ever since my recovery from the fever, I had been in the custom of takingevery night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was by means of this drugonly that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation oflife. Oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, I nowswallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly. But sleep didnot afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented athousand objects that scared me. Towards morning I was possessed by a kindof nightmare; I felt the fiend’s grasp in my neck and could not freemyself from it; groans and cries rang in my ears. My father, who waswatching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waveswere around, the cloudy sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense ofsecurity, a feeling that a truce was established between the present hourand the irresistible, disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calmforgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarlysusceptible.Chapter 22The voyage came to an end. We landed, and proceeded to Paris. I soonfound that I had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose before Icould continue my journey. My father’s care and attentions wereindefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings andsought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill. He wished me toseek amusement in society. I abhorred the face of man. Oh, notabhorred! They were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I feltattracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of anangelic nature and celestial mechanism. But I felt that I had no rightto share their intercourse. I had unchained an enemy among them whosejoy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans. How theywould, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world, did they knowmy unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me!My father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove byvarious arguments to banish my despair. Sometimes he thought that Ifelt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge ofmurder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.“Alas! My father,” said I, “how little do you know me. Human beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if sucha wretch as I felt pride. Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocentas I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the causeof this—I murdered her. William, Justine, and Henry—they alldied by my hands.”My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the sameassertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire anexplanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring ofdelirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presenteditself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved in myconvalescence. I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silenceconcerning the wretch I had created. I had a persuasion that I should besupposed mad, and this in itself would for ever have chained my tongue. But,besides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill myhearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates ofhis breast. I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy and wassilent when I would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret.Yet, still, words like those I have recorded would burst uncontrollablyfrom me. I could offer no explanation of them, but their truth in partrelieved the burden of my mysterious woe.Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder,“My dearest Victor, what infatuation is this? My dear son, I entreatyou never to make such an assertion again.”“I am not mad,” I cried energetically; “the sun and the heavens, whohave viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth. I am theassassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations.A thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to havesaved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could notsacrifice the whole human race.”The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas werederanged, and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation andendeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts. He wished as much aspossible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place inIreland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of mymisfortunes.As time passed away I became more calm; misery had her dwelling in myheart, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my owncrimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them. By the utmostself-violence I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, whichsometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world, and my mannerswere calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journeyto the sea of ice.A few days before we left Paris on our way to Switzerland, I received thefollowing letter from Elizabeth:“My dear Friend,“It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncledated at Paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and I mayhope to see you in less than a fortnight. My poor cousin, how much youmust have suffered! I expect to see you looking even more ill thanwhen you quitted Geneva. This winter has been passed most miserably,tortured as I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace inyour countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void ofcomfort and tranquillity.“Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserablea year ago, even perhaps augmented by time. I would not disturb you atthis period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you, but aconversation that I had with my uncle previous to his departure renderssome explanation necessary before we meet.Explanation! You may possibly say, What can Elizabeth have to explain? Ifyou really say this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied.But you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread and yetbe pleased with this explanation; and in a probability of this being thecase, I dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, Ihave often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin.“You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan ofyour parents ever since our infancy. We were told this when young, andtaught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly takeplace. We were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, Ibelieve, dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older. Butas brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards eachother without desiring a more intimate union, may not such also be ourcase? Tell me, dearest Victor. Answer me, I conjure you by our mutualhappiness, with simple truth—Do you not love another?“You have travelled; you have spent several years of your life atIngolstadt; and I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you lastautumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of everycreature, I could not help supposing that you might regret ourconnection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes ofyour parents, although they opposed themselves to your inclinations.But this is false reasoning. I confess to you, my friend, that I loveyou and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constantfriend and companion. But it is your happiness I desire as well as myown when I declare to you that our marriage would render me eternallymiserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice. Even nowI weep to think that, borne down as you are by the cruellestmisfortunes, you may stifle, by the word _honour_, all hope of thatlove and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself. I, whohave so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseriestenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes. Ah! Victor, be assuredthat your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to bemade miserable by this supposition. Be happy, my friend; and if youobey me in this one request, remain satisfied that nothing on earthwill have the power to interrupt my tranquillity.“Do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer tomorrow, or thenext day, or even until you come, if it will give you pain. My unclewill send me news of your health, and if I see but one smile on yourlips when we meet, occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine, Ishall need no other happiness.“Elizabeth Lavenza.“Geneva, May 18th, 17—”This letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat ofthe fiend—“_I will be with you on yourwedding-night!_” Such was my sentence, and on that night would thedæmon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse ofhappiness which promised partly to console my sufferings. On that night hehad determined to consummate his crimes by my death. Well, be it so; adeadly struggle would then assuredly take place, in which if he werevictorious I should be at peace and his power over me be at an end. If hewere vanquished, I should be a free man. Alas! What freedom? Such as thepeasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, hiscottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless,penniless, and alone, but free. Such would be my liberty except that in myElizabeth I possessed a treasure, alas, balanced by those horrors ofremorse and guilt which would pursue me until death.Sweet and beloved Elizabeth! I read and reread her letter, and somesoftened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacaldreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and theangel’s arm bared to drive me from all hope. Yet I would die to makeher happy. If the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet,again, I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate. Mydestruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner, but if my torturershould suspect that I postponed it, influenced by his menaces, he wouldsurely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge. He had vowed_to be with me on my wedding-night_, yet he did not consider thatthreat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show me thathe was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered Clerval immediatelyafter the enunciation of his threats. I resolved, therefore, that if myimmediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or myfather’s happiness, my adversary’s designs against my lifeshould not retard it a single hour.In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth. My letter was calm andaffectionate. “I fear, my beloved girl,” I said, “little happinessremains for us on earth; yet all that I may one day enjoy is centred inyou. Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I consecrate my lifeand my endeavours for contentment. I have one secret, Elizabeth, adreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame withhorror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will onlywonder that I survive what I have endured. I will confide this tale ofmisery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place,for, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us. Butuntil then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it. This I mostearnestly entreat, and I know you will comply.”In about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth’s letter we returnedto Geneva. The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears werein her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. I saw achange in her also. She was thinner and had lost much of that heavenlyvivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness and soft looks ofcompassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as Iwas.The tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure. Memory brought madnesswith it, and when I thought of what had passed, a real insanity possessedme; sometimes I was furious and burnt with rage, sometimes low anddespondent. I neither spoke nor looked at anyone, but sat motionless,bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me.Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voicewould soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with humanfeelings when sunk in torpor. She wept with me and for me. When reasonreturned, she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me withresignation. Ah! It is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for theguilty there is no peace. The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there isotherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief.Soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage withElizabeth. I remained silent.“Have you, then, some other attachment?”“None on earth. I love Elizabeth and look forward to our union withdelight. Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecratemyself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin.”“My dear Victor, do not speak thus. Heavy misfortunes have befallenus, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our lovefor those whom we have lost to those who yet live. Our circle will besmall but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune.And when time shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects ofcare will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruellydeprived.”Such were the lessons of my father. But to me the remembrance of thethreat returned; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend hadyet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him asinvincible, and that when he had pronounced the words “_I shall be withyou on your wedding-night_,” I should regard the threatened fate asunavoidable. But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth werebalanced with it, and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerfulcountenance, agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent, theceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined,the seal to my fate.Great God! If for one instant I had thought what might be the hellishintention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myselffor ever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast overthe earth than have consented to this miserable marriage. But, as ifpossessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his realintentions; and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death, Ihastened that of a far dearer victim.As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice ora prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me. But I concealed myfeelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to thecountenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicereye of Elizabeth. She looked forward to our union with placid contentment,not unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed,that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipateinto an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret.Preparations were made for the event, congratulatory visits were received,and all wore a smiling appearance. I shut up, as well as I could, in my ownheart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestnessinto the plans of my father, although they might only serve as thedecorations of my tragedy. Through my father’s exertions a part ofthe inheritance of Elizabeth had been restored to her by the Austriangovernment. A small possession on the shores of Como belonged to her. Itwas agreed that, immediately after our union, we should proceed to VillaLavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lakenear which it stood.In the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case thefiend should openly attack me. I carried pistols and a daggerconstantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, andby these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity. Indeed, as theperiod approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to beregarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped forin my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixedfor its solemnisation drew nearer and I heard it continually spoken ofas an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly tocalm her mind. But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and mydestiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her;and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which I hadpromised to reveal to her on the following day. My father was in themeantime overjoyed, and, in the bustle of preparation, only recognised inthe melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.After the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at myfather’s, but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence ourjourney by water, sleeping that night at Evian and continuing ourvoyage on the following day. The day was fair, the wind favourable;all smiled on our nuptial embarkation.Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed thefeeling of happiness. We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but wewere sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed thebeauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we sawMont Salêve, the pleasant banks of Montalègre, and at a distance,surmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc, and the assemblage of snowymountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting theopposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to theambition that would quit its native country, and an almostinsurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.I took the hand of Elizabeth. “You are sorrowful, my love. Ah! Ifyou knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure, you wouldendeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that thisone day at least permits me to enjoy.”“Be happy, my dear Victor,” replied Elizabeth; “there is, I hope,nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is notpainted in my face, my heart is contented. Something whispers to menot to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but Iwill not listen to such a sinister voice. Observe how fast we movealong and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes riseabove the dome of Mont Blanc, render this scene of beauty still moreinteresting. Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming inthe clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies atthe bottom. What a divine day! How happy and serene all natureappears!”Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from allreflection upon melancholy subjects. But her temper was fluctuating;joy for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave placeto distraction and reverie.The sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance andobserved its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of thelower hills. The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approachedthe amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary. Thespire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the rangeof mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity,sank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the waterand caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached theshore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers andhay. The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touchedthe shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to claspme and cling to me for ever.Chapter 23It was eight o’clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on theshore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn andcontemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscuredin darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines.The wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violencein the west. The moon had reached her summit in the heavens and wasbeginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than theflight of the vulture and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected thescene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless wavesthat were beginning to rise. Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended.I had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured theshapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind. I was anxiousand watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden inmy bosom; every sound terrified me, but I resolved that I would sell mylife dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or thatof my adversary was extinguished.Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence,but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, andtrembling, she asked, “What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor?What is it you fear?”“Oh! Peace, peace, my love,” replied I; “this night, andall will be safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful.”I passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected howfearful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife,and I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join heruntil I had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy.She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passagesof the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat tomy adversary. But I discovered no trace of him and was beginning toconjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent theexecution of his menaces when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadfulscream. It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired. As Iheard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, themotion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the bloodtrickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs. Thisstate lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushedinto the room.Great God! Why did I not then expire! Why am I here to relate thedestruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth? She wasthere, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging downand her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair. Everywhere Iturn I see the same figure—her bloodless arms and relaxed form flungby the murderer on its bridal bier. Could I behold this and live? Alas!Life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated. For a momentonly did I lose recollection; I fell senseless on the ground.When I recovered I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; theircountenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of othersappeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me. Iescaped from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, mywife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy. She had been moved from theposture in which I had first beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head uponher arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might havesupposed her asleep. I rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour, butthe deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what I now heldin my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished.The murderous mark of the fiend’s grasp was on her neck, and thebreath had ceased to issue from her lips.While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up.The windows of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind ofpanic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber.The shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to bedescribed, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred.A grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with hisfiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife. I rushed towardsthe window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me,leaped from his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning,plunged into the lake.The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. I pointed tothe spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track withboats; nets were cast, but in vain. After passing several hours, wereturned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been aform conjured up by my fancy. After having landed, they proceeded tosearch the country, parties going in different directions among thewoods and vines.I attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from thehouse, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunkenman, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered myeyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of fever. In this state Iwas carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what hadhappened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something thatI had lost.After an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the roomwhere the corpse of my beloved lay. There were women weeping around; Ihung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time nodistinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled tovarious subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and theircause. I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror. The deathof William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastlyof my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remainingfriends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even nowmight be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at hisfeet. This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action. I startedup and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but thewind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents. However, it washardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night. I hired mento row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief frommental torment in bodily exercise. But the overflowing misery I now felt,and the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of anyexertion. I threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave wayto every gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up, I saw scenes which werefamiliar to me in my happier time and which I had contemplated but the daybefore in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection.Tears streamed from my eyes. The rain had ceased for a moment, and I sawthe fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they hadthen been observed by Elizabeth. Nothing is so painful to the human mind asa great and sudden change. The sun might shine or the clouds might lower,but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before. A fiend hadsnatched from me every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever beenso miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history ofman.But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this lastoverwhelming event? Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their_acme_, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you. Knowthat, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate. Myown strength is exhausted, and I must tell, in a few words, what remains ofmy hideous narration.I arrived at Geneva. My father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunkunder the tidings that I bore. I see him now, excellent and venerable oldman! His eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and theirdelight—his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on withall that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, havingfew affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain. Cursed, cursedbe the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to wastein wretchedness! He could not live under the horrors that were accumulatedaround him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable torise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms.What then became of me? I know not; I lost sensation, and chains anddarkness were the only objects that pressed upon me. Sometimes,indeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant valeswith the friends of my youth, but I awoke and found myself in adungeon. Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clearconception of my miseries and situation and was then released from myprison. For they had called me mad, and during many months, as Iunderstood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.Liberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as Iawakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge. As thememory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on theircause—the monster whom I had created, the miserable dæmon whom I hadsent abroad into the world for my destruction. I was possessed by amaddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayedthat I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signalrevenge on his cursed head.Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began toreflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, abouta month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the townand told him that I had an accusation to make, that I knew thedestroyer of my family, and that I required him to exert his wholeauthority for the apprehension of the murderer.The magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness. “Beassured, sir,” said he, “no pains or exertions on my part shallbe spared to discover the villain.”“I thank you,” replied I; “listen, therefore, to thedeposition that I have to make. It is indeed a tale so strange that Ishould fear you would not credit it were there not something in truthwhich, however wonderful, forces conviction. The story is too connected tobe mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood.” Mymanner as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had formed in myown heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purposequieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life. I now relatedmy history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates withaccuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation.The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continuedhe became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder withhorror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was paintedon his countenance.When I had concluded my narration, I said, “This is the being whom Iaccuse and for whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert yourwhole power. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope thatyour feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of thosefunctions on this occasion.”This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my ownauditor. He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is givento a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called uponto act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulityreturned. He, however, answered mildly, “I would willingly afford youevery aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears tohave powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. Who can follow ananimal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens whereno man would venture to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed sincethe commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place hehas wandered or what region he may now inhabit.”“I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, and ifhe has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamoisand destroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive your thoughts; you do notcredit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with thepunishment which is his desert.”As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated.“You are mistaken,” said he. “I will exert myself, and ifit is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall sufferpunishment proportionate to his crimes. But I fear, from what you haveyourself described to be his properties, that this will proveimpracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you shouldmake up your mind to disappointment.”“That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail. Myrevenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, Iconfess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul. My rageis unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turnedloose upon society, still exists. You refuse my just demand; I havebut one resource, and I devote myself, either in my life or death, tohis destruction.”I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzyin my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fiercenesswhich the martyrs of old are said to have possessed. But to a Genevanmagistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those ofdevotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance ofmadness. He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child andreverted to my tale as the effects of delirium.“Man,” I cried, “how ignorant art thou in thy pride ofwisdom! Cease; you know not what it is you say.”I broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate onsome other mode of action.Chapter 24My present situation was one in which all voluntary thought wasswallowed up and lost. I was hurried away by fury; revenge aloneendowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings andallowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwisedelirium or death would have been my portion.My first resolution was to quit Geneva for ever; my country, which, when Iwas happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, becamehateful. I provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few jewelswhich had belonged to my mother, and departed.And now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life. I havetraversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardshipswhich travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet. How Ihave lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing limbs uponthe sandy plain and prayed for death. But revenge kept me alive; I darednot die and leave my adversary in being.When I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which Imight trace the steps of my fiendish enemy. But my plan was unsettled,and I wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertainwhat path I should pursue. As night approached I found myself at theentrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my fatherreposed. I entered it and approached the tomb which marked theirgraves. Everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, whichwere gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and thescene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterestedobserver. The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and tocast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of themourner.The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way torage and despair. They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived,and to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence. I knelt on the grassand kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, “By thesacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by thedeep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and thespirits that preside over thee, to pursue the dæmon who caused this misery,until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict. For this purpose I willpreserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will I again behold the sunand tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from myeyes for ever. And I call on you, spirits of the dead, and on you, wanderingministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work. Let the cursedand hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that nowtorments me.”I had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured methat the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion, butthe furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage choked my utterance.I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendishlaugh. It rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoedit, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter.Surely in that moment I should have been possessed by frenzy and havedestroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that Iwas reserved for vengeance. The laughter died away, when a well-knownand abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in anaudible whisper, “I am satisfied, miserable wretch! You havedetermined to live, and I am satisfied.”I darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devileluded my grasp. Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shonefull upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more thanmortal speed.I pursued him, and for many months this has been my task. Guided by aslight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly. Theblue Mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the fiendenter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea. Itook my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how.Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, Ihave ever followed in his track. Sometimes the peasants, scared bythis horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself,who feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die,left some mark to guide me. The snows descended on my head, and I sawthe print of his huge step on the white plain. To you first enteringon life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understandwhat I have felt and still feel? Cold, want, and fatigue were theleast pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some deviland carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of goodfollowed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenlyextricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties. Sometimes,when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repastwas prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me. Thefare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, butI will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I hadinvoked to aid me. Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, andI was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed thefew drops that revived me, and vanish.I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the dæmongenerally avoided these, as it was here that the population of thecountry chiefly collected. In other places human beings were seldomseen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed mypath. I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagersby distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed,which, after taking a small part, I always presented to those who hadprovided me with fire and utensils for cooking.My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was duringsleep alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! Often, when mostmiserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. Thespirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, ofhappiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage. Deprived ofthis respite, I should have sunk under my hardships. During the day I wassustained and inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw myfriends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolentcountenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth’svoice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth. Often, when wearied bya toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night shouldcome and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearestfriends. What agonising fondness did I feel for them! How did I cling totheir dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, andpersuade myself that they still lived! At such moments vengeance, thatburned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards thedestruction of the dæmon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as themechanical impulse of some power of which I was unconscious, than as theardent desire of my soul.What his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know. Sometimes, indeed, heleft marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guidedme and instigated my fury. “My reign is not yetover”—these words were legible in one of theseinscriptions—“you live, and my power is complete. Follow me; Iseek the everlasting ices of the north, where you will feel the misery ofcold and frost, to which I am impassive. You will find near this place, ifyou follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed. Come on, myenemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives, but many hard and miserablehours must you endure until that period shall arrive.”Scoffing devil! Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee,miserable fiend, to torture and death. Never will I give up my searchuntil he or I perish; and then with what ecstasy shall I join myElizabeth and my departed friends, who even now prepare for me thereward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage!As I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened and thecold increased in a degree almost too severe to support. The peasants wereshut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth toseize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places toseek for prey. The rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could beprocured; and thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance.The triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours. Oneinscription that he left was in these words: “Prepare! Your toilsonly begin; wrap yourself in furs and provide food, for we shall soon enterupon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlastinghatred.”My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; Iresolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on Heaven to supportme, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts,until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundaryof the horizon. Oh! How unlike it was to the blue seasons of thesouth! Covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished from land byits superior wildness and ruggedness. The Greeks wept for joy whenthey beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed withrapture the boundary of their toils. I did not weep, but I knelt downand with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me insafety to the place where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversary’s gibe,to meet and grapple with him.Some weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs and thustraversed the snows with inconceivable speed. I know not whether thefiend possessed the same advantages, but I found that, as before I haddaily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so thatwhen I first saw the ocean he was but one day’s journey in advance, andI hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach. With newcourage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretchedhamlet on the seashore. I inquired of the inhabitants concerning thefiend and gained accurate information. A gigantic monster, they said,had arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols,putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear ofhis terrific appearance. He had carried off their store of winterfood, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on anumerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the samenight, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued hisjourney across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and theyconjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of theice or frozen by the eternal frosts.On hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair.He had escaped me, and I must commence a destructive and almost endlessjourney across the mountainous ices of the ocean, amidst cold that fewof the inhabitants could long endure and which I, the native of agenial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive. Yet at the ideathat the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeancereturned, and like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling.After a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hoveredround and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for my journey.I exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities ofthe Frozen Ocean, and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, Ideparted from land.I cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but I have enduredmisery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retributionburning within my heart could have enabled me to support. Immense andrugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and I often heardthe thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction. Butagain the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure.By the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess thatI had passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protractionof hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops ofdespondency and grief from my eyes. Despair had indeed almost securedher prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery. Once, afterthe poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained thesummit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue,died, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eyecaught a dark speck upon the dusky plain. I strained my sight todiscover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when Idistinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-knownform within. Oh! With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart!Warm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they mightnot intercept the view I had of the dæmon; but still my sight wasdimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions thatoppressed me, I wept aloud.But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of theirdead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after anhour’s rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterlyirksome to me, I continued my route. The sledge was still visible, nordid I again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a shorttime some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags. I indeedperceptibly gained on it, and when, after nearly two days’ journey, Ibeheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded withinme.But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes weresuddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I hadever done before. A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, asthe waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more ominousand terrific. I pressed on, but in vain. The wind arose; the sea roared;and, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with atremendous and overwhelming sound. The work was soon finished; in a fewminutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, and I was leftdrifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening andthus preparing for me a hideous death.In this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died, and Imyself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when I saw yourvessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life.I had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astoundedat the sight. I quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars, andby these means was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft inthe direction of your ship. I had determined, if you were going southwards,still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon mypurpose. I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursuemy enemy. But your direction was northwards. You took me on board when myvigour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk under my multipliedhardships into a death which I still dread, for my task is unfulfilled.Oh! When will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the dæmon, allowme the rest I so much desire; or must I die, and he yet live? If I do,swear to me, Walton, that he shall not escape, that you will seek himand satisfy my vengeance in his death. And do I dare to ask of you toundertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that I have undergone?No; I am not so selfish. Yet, when I am dead, if he should appear, ifthe ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you, swear that heshall not live—swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulatedwoes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes. He is eloquentand persuasive, and once his words had even power over my heart; buttrust him not. His soul is as hellish as his form, full of treacheryand fiend-like malice. Hear him not; call on the names of William,Justine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched Victor, andthrust your sword into his heart. I will hover near and direct thesteel aright.Walton, _in continuation._August 26th, 17—.You have read this strange and terrific story, Margaret; and do you notfeel your blood congeal with horror, like that which even now curdlesmine? Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue histale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered withdifficulty the words so replete with anguish. His fine and lovely eyeswere now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrowand quenched in infinite wretchedness. Sometimes he commanded hiscountenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with atranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like avolcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expressionof the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor.His tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth,yet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he showed me,and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me agreater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations,however earnest and connected. Such a monster has, then, really existence!I cannot doubt it, yet I am lost in surprise and admiration. Sometimes Iendeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the particulars of hiscreature’s formation, but on this point he was impenetrable.“Are you mad, my friend?” said he. “Or whither does yoursenseless curiosity lead you? Would you also create for yourself and theworld a demoniacal enemy? Peace, peace! Learn my miseries and do not seekto increase your own.”Frankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history; he askedto see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places,but principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he heldwith his enemy. “Since you have preserved my narration,” saidhe, “I would not that a mutilated one should go down toposterity.”Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangesttale that ever imagination formed. My thoughts and every feeling of mysoul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this taleand his own elevated and gentle manners have created. I wish to soothehim, yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute ofevery hope of consolation, to live? Oh, no! The only joy that he cannow know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace anddeath. Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude anddelirium; he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with hisfriends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries orexcitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of hisfancy, but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of aremote world. This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that renderthem to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth.Our conversations are not always confined to his own history andmisfortunes. On every point of general literature he displaysunbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension. Hiseloquence is forcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when he relatesa pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love,without tears. What a glorious creature must he have been in the daysof his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin! He seemsto feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall.“When younger,” said he, “I believed myself destined forsome great enterprise. My feelings are profound, but I possessed a coolnessof judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements. This sentiment ofthe worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed,for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents thatmight be useful to my fellow creatures. When I reflected on the work I hadcompleted, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rationalanimal, I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors. Butthis thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, nowserves only to plunge me lower in the dust. All my speculations and hopesare as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I amchained in an eternal hell. My imagination was vivid, yet my powers ofanalysis and application were intense; by the union of these qualities Iconceived the idea and executed the creation of a man. Even now I cannotrecollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete. I trodheaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the ideaof their effects. From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a loftyambition; but how am I sunk! Oh! My friend, if you had known me as I oncewas, you would not recognise me in this state of degradation. Despondencyrarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell,never, never again to rise.”Must I then lose this admirable being? I have longed for a friend; I havesought one who would sympathise with and love me. Behold, on these desertseas I have found such a one, but I fear I have gained him only to know hisvalue and lose him. I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea.“I thank you, Walton,” he said, “for your kind intentions towards somiserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and freshaffections, think you that any can replace those who are gone? Can anyman be to me as Clerval was, or any woman another Elizabeth? Evenwhere the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence,the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over ourminds which hardly any later friend can obtain. They know ourinfantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified,are never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with morecertain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives. A sister or abrother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early,suspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend,however strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, becontemplated with suspicion. But I enjoyed friends, dear not onlythrough habit and association, but from their own merits; and whereverI am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the conversation ofClerval will be ever whispered in my ear. They are dead, and but onefeeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life. If Iwere engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensiveutility to my fellow creatures, then could I live to fulfil it. Butsuch is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom Igave existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and I may die.”My beloved Sister,September 2d.I write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am everdoomed to see again dear England and the dearer friends that inhabitit. I am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape andthreaten every moment to crush my vessel. The brave fellows whom Ihave persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid, but I havenone to bestow. There is something terribly appalling in oursituation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert me. Yet it isterrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangeredthrough me. If we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause.And what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind? You will not hear of mydestruction, and you will anxiously await my return. Years will pass, andyou will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope. Oh! Mybeloved sister, the sickening failing of your heart-felt expectations is,in prospect, more terrible to me than my own death. But you have a husbandand lovely children; you may be happy. Heaven bless you and make you so!My unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion. Heendeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possessionwhich he valued. He reminds me how often the same accidents havehappened to other navigators who have attempted this sea, and in spiteof myself, he fills me with cheerful auguries. Even the sailors feelthe power of his eloquence; when he speaks, they no longer despair; herouses their energies, and while they hear his voice they believe thesevast mountains of ice are mole-hills which will vanish before theresolutions of man. These feelings are transitory; each day ofexpectation delayed fills them with fear, and I almost dread a mutinycaused by this despair.September 5th.A scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that, although it ishighly probable that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannotforbear recording it.We are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent dangerof being crushed in their conflict. The cold is excessive, and many ofmy unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene ofdesolation. Frankenstein has daily declined in health; a feverish firestill glimmers in his eyes, but he is exhausted, and when suddenlyroused to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparentlifelessness.I mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a mutiny.This morning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend—hiseyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly—I was roused by halfa dozen of the sailors, who demanded admission into the cabin. Theyentered, and their leader addressed me. He told me that he and hiscompanions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputationto me to make me a requisition which, in justice, I could not refuse.We were immured in ice and should probably never escape, but theyfeared that if, as was possible, the ice should dissipate and a freepassage be opened, I should be rash enough to continue my voyage andlead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmountedthis. They insisted, therefore, that I should engage with a solemnpromise that if the vessel should be freed I would instantly direct mycourse southwards.This speech troubled me. I had not despaired, nor had I yet conceivedthe idea of returning if set free. Yet could I, in justice, or even inpossibility, refuse this demand? I hesitated before I answered, whenFrankenstein, who had at first been silent, and indeed appeared hardlyto have force enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled,and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour. Turning towards the men,he said,“What do you mean? What do you demand of your captain? Are you, then,so easily turned from your design? Did you not call this a gloriousexpedition? “And wherefore was it glorious? Not because the way wassmooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers andterror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forthand your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded it, andthese you were to brave and overcome. For this was it a glorious, for thiswas it an honourable undertaking. You were hereafter to be hailed as thebenefactors of your species, your names adored as belonging to brave menwho encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind. And now,behold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the firstmighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away and are contentto be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold andperil; and so, poor souls, they were chilly and returned to their warmfiresides. Why, that requires not this preparation; ye need not have comethus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to proveyourselves cowards. Oh! Be men, or be more than men. Be steady to yourpurposes and firm as a rock. This ice is not made of such stuff as yourhearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that itshall not. Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgracemarked on your brows. Return as heroes who have fought and conquered andwho know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe.”He spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressedin his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that canyou wonder that these men were moved? They looked at one another and wereunable to reply. I spoke; I told them to retire and consider of what hadbeen said, that I would not lead them farther north if they strenuouslydesired the contrary, but that I hoped that, with reflection, their couragewould return.They retired and I turned towards my friend, but he was sunk in languor andalmost deprived of life.How all this will terminate, I know not, but I had rather die thanreturn shamefully, my purpose unfulfilled. Yet I fear such will be myfate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can neverwillingly continue to endure their present hardships.September 7th.The die is cast; I have consented to return if we are not destroyed.Thus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; I come backignorant and disappointed. It requires more philosophy than I possessto bear this injustice with patience.September 12th.It is past; I am returning to England. I have lost my hopes of utilityand glory; I have lost my friend. But I will endeavour to detail thesebitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and while I am waftedtowards England and towards you, I will not despond.September 9th, the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder were heardat a distance as the islands split and cracked in every direction. We werein the most imminent peril, but as we could only remain passive, my chiefattention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased insuch a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed. The ice crackedbehind us and was driven with force towards the north; a breeze sprang fromthe west, and on the 11th the passage towards the south became perfectlyfree. When the sailors saw this and that their return to their nativecountry was apparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them,loud and long-continued. Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked thecause of the tumult. “They shout,” I said, “because theywill soon return to England.”“Do you, then, really return?”“Alas! Yes; I cannot withstand their demands. I cannot lead themunwillingly to danger, and I must return.”“Do so, if you will; but I will not. You may give up your purpose, butmine is assigned to me by Heaven, and I dare not. I am weak, butsurely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me withsufficient strength.” Saying this, he endeavoured to spring from thebed, but the exertion was too great for him; he fell back and fainted.It was long before he was restored, and I often thought that life wasentirely extinct. At length he opened his eyes; he breathed withdifficulty and was unable to speak. The surgeon gave him a composingdraught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed. In the meantime hetold me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live.His sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve and be patient. I satby his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; butpresently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near,said, “Alas! The strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shallsoon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being. Thinknot, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel that burninghatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed; but I feel myselfjustified in desiring the death of my adversary. During these last days Ihave been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do I find it blamable.In a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature and wasbound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness andwell-being. This was my duty, but there was another still paramount tothat. My duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims tomy attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness ormisery. Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, tocreate a companion for the first creature. He showed unparalleled malignityand selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destructionbeings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do Iknow where this thirst for vengeance may end. Miserable himself that he mayrender no other wretched, he ought to die. The task of his destruction wasmine, but I have failed. When actuated by selfish and vicious motives, Iasked you to undertake my unfinished work, and I renew this request now,when I am only induced by reason and virtue.“Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfilthis task; and now that you are returning to England, you will havelittle chance of meeting with him. But the consideration of thesepoints, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, Ileave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the nearapproach of death. I dare not ask you to do what I think right, for Imay still be misled by passion.“That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; inother respects, this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is theonly happy one which I have enjoyed for several years. The forms ofthe beloved dead flit before me, and I hasten to their arms. Farewell,Walton! Seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition, even if itbe only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself inscience and discoveries. Yet why do I say this? I have myself beenblasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed.”His voice became fainter as he spoke, and at length, exhausted by hiseffort, he sank into silence. About half an hour afterwards heattempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, andhis eyes closed for ever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passedaway from his lips.Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of thisglorious spirit? What can I say that will enable you to understand thedepth of my sorrow? All that I should express would be inadequate andfeeble. My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud ofdisappointment. But I journey towards England, and I may there findconsolation.I am interrupted. What do these sounds portend? It is midnight; thebreeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir. Again thereis a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabinwhere the remains of Frankenstein still lie. I must arise and examine.Good night, my sister.Great God! what a scene has just taken place! I am yet dizzy with theremembrance of it. I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detailit; yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete without thisfinal and wonderful catastrophe.I entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirablefriend. Over him hung a form which I cannot find words todescribe—gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in itsproportions. As he hung over the coffin, his face was concealed by longlocks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour andapparent texture like that of a mummy. When he heard the sound of myapproach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprungtowards the window. Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, ofsuch loathsome yet appalling hideousness. I shut my eyes involuntarily andendeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer.I called on him to stay.He paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards thelifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, andevery feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of someuncontrollable passion.“That is also my victim!” he exclaimed. “In his murder mycrimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to itsclose! Oh, Frankenstein! Generous and self-devoted being! What does itavail that I now ask thee to pardon me? I, who irretrievably destroyed theeby destroying all thou lovedst. Alas! He is cold, he cannot answerme.”His voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested tome the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying hisenemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion. Iapproached this tremendous being; I dared not again raise my eyes to hisface, there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness. Iattempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips. The monstercontinued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches. At length Igathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion.“Your repentance,” I said, “is now superfluous. If youhad listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorsebefore you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity,Frankenstein would yet have lived.”“And do you dream?” said the dæmon. “Do you think that I was thendead to agony and remorse? He,” he continued, pointing to the corpse,“he suffered not in the consummation of the deed. Oh! Not theten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during thelingering detail of its execution. A frightful selfishness hurried meon, while my heart was poisoned with remorse. Think you that thegroans of Clerval were music to my ears? My heart was fashioned to besusceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to viceand hatred, it did not endure the violence of the change withouttorture such as you cannot even imagine.“After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland, heart-brokenand overcome. I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; Iabhorred myself. But when I discovered that he, the author at once ofmy existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope forhappiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon mehe sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from theindulgence of which I was for ever barred, then impotent envy and bitterindignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance. Irecollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished. Iknew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture, but I was theslave, not the master, of an impulse which I detested yet could notdisobey. Yet when she died! Nay, then I was not miserable. I hadcast off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of mydespair. Evil thenceforth became my good. Urged thus far, I had nochoice but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willinglychosen. The completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiablepassion. And now it is ended; there is my last victim!”I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I calledto mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence andpersuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of myfriend, indignation was rekindled within me. “Wretch!” I said.“It is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that youhave made. You throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they areconsumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall. Hypocritical fiend!If he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again wouldhe become the prey, of your accursed vengeance. It is not pity that youfeel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawnfrom your power.”“Oh, it is not thus—not thus,” interrupted the being.“Yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears tobe the purport of my actions. Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery.No sympathy may I ever find. When I first sought it, it was the love ofvirtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole beingoverflowed, that I wished to be participated. But now that virtue hasbecome to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned intobitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy? I amcontent to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I amwell satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory. Oncemy fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. OnceI falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, wouldlove me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding. I wasnourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion. But now crime hasdegraded me beneath the meanest animal. No guilt, no mischief, nomalignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine. When I run over thefrightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the samecreature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendentvisions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness. But it is even so; thefallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and manhad friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone.“You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of mycrimes and his misfortunes. But in the detail which he gave you of themhe could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I enduredwasting in impotent passions. For while I destroyed his hopes, I didnot satisfy my own desires. They were for ever ardent and craving; stillI desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned. Was there noinjustice in this? Am I to be thought the only criminal, when allhumankind sinned against me? Why do you not hate Felix, who drove hisfriend from his door with contumely? Why do you not execrate the rusticwho sought to destroy the saviour of his child? Nay, these are virtuousand immaculate beings! I, the miserable and the abandoned, am anabortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on. Even now myblood boils at the recollection of this injustice.“But it is true that I am a wretch. I have murdered the lovely andthe helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped todeath his throat who never injured me or any other living thing. I havedevoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love andadmiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to thatirremediable ruin. There he lies, white and cold in death. You hate me, butyour abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself. I look on thehands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which theimagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these handswill meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more.“Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief. My workis nearly complete. Neither yours nor any man’s death is needed toconsummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done,but it requires my own. Do not think that I shall be slow to perform thissacrifice. I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought methither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I shallcollect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that itsremains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who wouldcreate such another as I have been. I shall die. I shall no longer feel theagonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yetunquenched. He is dead who called me into being; and when I shall be nomore, the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish. I shall nolonger see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks. Light,feeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition must I find myhappiness. Some years ago, when the images which this world affords firstopened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard therustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were all tome, I should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation. Polluted bycrimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but indeath?“Farewell! I leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom theseeyes will ever behold. Farewell, Frankenstein! If thou wert yet aliveand yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be bettersatiated in my life than in my destruction. But it was not so; thoudidst seek my extinction, that I might not cause greater wretchedness;and if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to thinkand feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater thanthat which I feel. Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior tothine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in mywounds until death shall close them for ever.“But soon,” he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm, “Ishall die, and what I now feel be no longer felt. Soon these burningmiseries will be extinct. I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly andexult in the agony of the torturing flames. The light of that conflagrationwill fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds. My spiritwill sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus.Farewell.”He sprang from the cabin-window as he said this, upon the ice raftwhich lay close to the vessel. He was soon borne away by the waves andlost in darkness and distance.

+CHAPTER II
+
+JONATHAN HARKER�S JOURNAL--_continued_
+
+_5 May._--I must have been asleep, for certainly if I had been fully
+
+awake I must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place. In
+
+the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as several dark
+
+ways led from it under great round arches, it perhaps seemed bigger than
+
+it really is. I have not yet been able to see it by daylight.
+
+When the cal�che stopped, the driver jumped down and held out his hand
+
+to assist me to alight. Again I could not but notice his prodigious
+
+strength. His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have
+
+crushed mine if he had chosen. Then he took out my traps, and placed
+
+them on the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door, old and
+
+studded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of
+
+massive stone. I could see even in the dim light that the stone was
+
+massively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time and
+
+weather. As I stood, the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the
+
+reins; the horses started forward, and trap and all disappeared down one
+
+of the dark openings.
+
+I stood in silence where I was, for I did not know what to do. Of bell
+
+or knocker there was no sign; through these frowning walls and dark
+
+window openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate. The
+
+time I waited seemed endless, and I felt doubts and fears crowding upon
+
+me. What sort of place had I come to, and among what kind of people?
+
+What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked? Was this a
+
+customary incident in the life of a solicitor�s clerk sent out to
+
+explain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner? Solicitor�s
+
+clerk! Mina would not like that. Solicitor--for just before leaving
+
+London I got word that my examination was successful; and I am now a
+
+full-blown solicitor! I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if
+
+I were awake. It all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me, and I
+
+expected that I should suddenly awake, and find myself at home, with
+
+the dawn struggling in through the windows, as I had now and again felt
+
+in the morning after a day of overwork. But my flesh answered the
+
+pinching test, and my eyes were not to be deceived. I was indeed awake
+
+and among the Carpathians. All I could do now was to be patient, and to
+
+wait the coming of the morning.
+
+Just as I had come to this conclusion I heard a heavy step approaching
+
+behind the great door, and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming
+
+light. Then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of
+
+massive bolts drawn back. A key was turned with the loud grating noise
+
+of long disuse, and the great door swung back.
+
+Within, stood a tall old man, clean shaven save for a long white
+
+moustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck
+
+of colour about him anywhere. He held in his hand an antique silver
+
+lamp, in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind,
+
+throwing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the
+
+open door. The old man motioned me in with his right hand with a courtly
+
+gesture, saying in excellent English, but with a strange intonation:--
+
+�Welcome to my house! Enter freely and of your own will!� He made no
+
+motion of stepping to meet me, but stood like a statue, as though his
+
+gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone. The instant, however, that
+
+I had stepped over the threshold, he moved impulsively forward, and
+
+holding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince,
+
+an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as
+
+ice--more like the hand of a dead than a living man. Again he said:--
+
+�Welcome to my house. Come freely. Go safely; and leave something of the
+
+happiness you bring!� The strength of the handshake was so much akin to
+
+that which I had noticed in the driver, whose face I had not seen, that
+
+for a moment I doubted if it were not the same person to whom I was
+
+speaking; so to make sure, I said interrogatively:--
+
+�Count Dracula?� He bowed in a courtly way as he replied:--
+
+�I am Dracula; and I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house. Come in;
+
+the night air is chill, and you must need to eat and rest.� As he was
+
+speaking, he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall, and stepping out,
+
+took my luggage; he had carried it in before I could forestall him. I
+
+protested but he insisted:--
+
+�Nay, sir, you are my guest. It is late, and my people are not
+
+available. Let me see to your comfort myself.� He insisted on carrying
+
+my traps along the passage, and then up a great winding stair, and
+
+along another great passage, on whose stone floor our steps rang
+
+heavily. At the end of this he threw open a heavy door, and I rejoiced
+
+to see within a well-lit room in which a table was spread for supper,
+
+and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly replenished,
+
+flamed and flared.
+
+The Count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing
+
+the room, opened another door, which led into a small octagonal room lit
+
+by a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort. Passing
+
+through this, he opened another door, and motioned me to enter. It was a
+
+welcome sight; for here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with
+
+another log fire,--also added to but lately, for the top logs were
+
+fresh--which sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney. The Count himself
+
+left my luggage inside and withdrew, saying, before he closed the
+
+door:--
+
+�You will need, after your journey, to refresh yourself by making your
+
+toilet. I trust you will find all you wish. When you are ready, come
+
+into the other room, where you will find your supper prepared.�
+
+The light and warmth and the Count�s courteous welcome seemed to have
+
+dissipated all my doubts and fears. Having then reached my normal state,
+
+I discovered that I was half famished with hunger; so making a hasty
+
+toilet, I went into the other room.
+
+I found supper already laid out. My host, who stood on one side of the
+
+great fireplace, leaning against the stonework, made a graceful wave of
+
+his hand to the table, and said:--
+
+�I pray you, be seated and sup how you please. You will, I trust, excuse
+
+me that I do not join you; but I have dined already, and I do not sup.�
+
+I handed to him the sealed letter which Mr. Hawkins had entrusted to me.
+
+He opened it and read it gravely; then, with a charming smile, he handed
+
+it to me to read. One passage of it, at least, gave me a thrill of
+
+pleasure.
+
+�I must regret that an attack of gout, from which malady I am a constant
+
+sufferer, forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time to
+
+come; but I am happy to say I can send a sufficient substitute, one in
+
+whom I have every possible confidence. He is a young man, full of energy
+
+and talent in his own way, and of a very faithful disposition. He is
+
+discreet and silent, and has grown into manhood in my service. He shall
+
+be ready to attend on you when you will during his stay, and shall take
+
+your instructions in all matters.�
+
+The Count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish, and I
+
+fell to at once on an excellent roast chicken. This, with some cheese
+
+and a salad and a bottle of old Tokay, of which I had two glasses, was
+
+my supper. During the time I was eating it the Count asked me many
+
+questions as to my journey, and I told him by degrees all I had
+
+experienced.
+
+By this time I had finished my supper, and by my host�s desire had drawn
+
+up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me,
+
+at the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke. I had now an
+
+opportunity of observing him, and found him of a very marked
+
+physiognomy.
+
+His face was a strong--a very strong--aquiline, with high bridge of the
+
+thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils; with lofty domed forehead, and
+
+hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere. His
+
+eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy
+
+hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion. The mouth, so far as I
+
+could see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather
+
+cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth; these protruded over
+
+the lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a
+
+man of his years. For the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops
+
+extremely pointed; the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm
+
+though thin. The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor.
+
+Hitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees
+
+in the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine; but seeing
+
+them now close to me, I could not but notice that they were rather
+
+coarse--broad, with squat fingers. Strange to say, there were hairs in
+
+the centre of the palm. The nails were long and fine, and cut to a sharp
+
+point. As the Count leaned over me and his hands touched me, I could not
+
+repress a shudder. It may have been that his breath was rank, but a
+
+horrible feeling of nausea came over me, which, do what I would, I could
+
+not conceal. The Count, evidently noticing it, drew back; and with a
+
+grim sort of smile, which showed more than he had yet done his
+
+protuberant teeth, sat himself down again on his own side of the
+
+fireplace. We were both silent for a while; and as I looked towards the
+
+window I saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn. There seemed a
+
+strange stillness over everything; but as I listened I heard as if from
+
+down below in the valley the howling of many wolves. The Count�s eyes
+
+gleamed, and he said:--
+
+�Listen to them--the children of the night. What music they make!�
+
+Seeing, I suppose, some expression in my face strange to him, he
+
+added:--
+
+�Ah, sir, you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of the
+
+hunter.� Then he rose and said:--
+
+�But you must be tired. Your bedroom is all ready, and to-morrow you
+
+shall sleep as late as you will. I have to be away till the afternoon;
+
+so sleep well and dream well!� With a courteous bow, he opened for me
+
+himself the door to the octagonal room, and I entered my bedroom....
+
+I am all in a sea of wonders. I doubt; I fear; I think strange things,
+
+which I dare not confess to my own soul. God keep me, if only for the
+
+sake of those dear to me!
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_7 May._--It is again early morning, but I have rested and enjoyed the
+
+last twenty-four hours. I slept till late in the day, and awoke of my
+
+own accord. When I had dressed myself I went into the room where we had
+
+supped, and found a cold breakfast laid out, with coffee kept hot by the
+
+pot being placed on the hearth. There was a card on the table, on which
+
+was written:--
+
+�I have to be absent for a while. Do not wait for me.--D.� I set to and
+
+enjoyed a hearty meal. When I had done, I looked for a bell, so that I
+
+might let the servants know I had finished; but I could not find one.
+
+There are certainly odd deficiencies in the house, considering the
+
+extraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me. The table service
+
+is of gold, and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense value.
+
+The curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of
+
+my bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics, and must have
+
+been of fabulous value when they were made, for they are centuries old,
+
+though in excellent order. I saw something like them in Hampton Court,
+
+but there they were worn and frayed and moth-eaten. But still in none of
+
+the rooms is there a mirror. There is not even a toilet glass on my
+
+table, and I had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before I
+
+could either shave or brush my hair. I have not yet seen a servant
+
+anywhere, or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves.
+
+Some time after I had finished my meal--I do not know whether to call it
+
+breakfast or dinner, for it was between five and six o�clock when I had
+
+it--I looked about for something to read, for I did not like to go about
+
+the castle until I had asked the Count�s permission. There was
+
+absolutely nothing in the room, book, newspaper, or even writing
+
+materials; so I opened another door in the room and found a sort of
+
+library. The door opposite mine I tried, but found it locked.
+
+In the library I found, to my great delight, a vast number of English
+
+books, whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines and
+
+newspapers. A table in the centre was littered with English magazines
+
+and newspapers, though none of them were of very recent date. The books
+
+were of the most varied kind--history, geography, politics, political
+
+economy, botany, geology, law--all relating to England and English life
+
+and customs and manners. There were even such books of reference as the
+
+London Directory, the �Red� and �Blue� books, Whitaker�s Almanac, the
+
+Army and Navy Lists, and--it somehow gladdened my heart to see it--the
+
+Law List.
+
+Whilst I was looking at the books, the door opened, and the Count
+
+entered. He saluted me in a hearty way, and hoped that I had had a good
+
+night�s rest. Then he went on:--
+
+�I am glad you found your way in here, for I am sure there is much that
+
+will interest you. These companions�--and he laid his hand on some of
+
+the books--�have been good friends to me, and for some years past, ever
+
+since I had the idea of going to London, have given me many, many hours
+
+of pleasure. Through them I have come to know your great England; and to
+
+know her is to love her. I long to go through the crowded streets of
+
+your mighty London, to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of
+
+humanity, to share its life, its change, its death, and all that makes
+
+it what it is. But alas! as yet I only know your tongue through books.
+
+To you, my friend, I look that I know it to speak.�
+
+�But, Count,� I said, �you know and speak English thoroughly!� He bowed
+
+gravely.
+
+�I thank you, my friend, for your all too-flattering estimate, but yet I
+
+fear that I am but a little way on the road I would travel. True, I know
+
+the grammar and the words, but yet I know not how to speak them.�
+
+�Indeed,� I said, �you speak excellently.�
+
+�Not so,� he answered. �Well, I know that, did I move and speak in your
+
+London, none there are who would not know me for a stranger. That is not
+
+enough for me. Here I am noble; I am _boyar_; the common people know me,
+
+and I am master. But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one; men
+
+know him not--and to know not is to care not for. I am content if I am
+
+like the rest, so that no man stops if he see me, or pause in his
+
+speaking if he hear my words, �Ha, ha! a stranger!� I have been so long
+
+master that I would be master still--or at least that none other should
+
+be master of me. You come to me not alone as agent of my friend Peter
+
+Hawkins, of Exeter, to tell me all about my new estate in London. You
+
+shall, I trust, rest here with me awhile, so that by our talking I may
+
+learn the English intonation; and I would that you tell me when I make
+
+error, even of the smallest, in my speaking. I am sorry that I had to be
+
+away so long to-day; but you will, I know, forgive one who has so many
+
+important affairs in hand.�
+
+Of course I said all I could about being willing, and asked if I might
+
+come into that room when I chose. He answered: �Yes, certainly,� and
+
+added:--
+
+�You may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors are
+
+locked, where of course you will not wish to go. There is reason that
+
+all things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with
+
+my knowledge, you would perhaps better understand.� I said I was sure of
+
+this, and then he went on:--
+
+�We are in Transylvania; and Transylvania is not England. Our ways are
+
+not your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things. Nay, from
+
+what you have told me of your experiences already, you know something of
+
+what strange things there may be.�
+
+This led to much conversation; and as it was evident that he wanted to
+
+talk, if only for talking�s sake, I asked him many questions regarding
+
+things that had already happened to me or come within my notice.
+
+Sometimes he sheered off the subject, or turned the conversation by
+
+pretending not to understand; but generally he answered all I asked most
+
+frankly. Then as time went on, and I had got somewhat bolder, I asked
+
+him of some of the strange things of the preceding night, as, for
+
+instance, why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blue
+
+flames. He then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a
+
+certain night of the year--last night, in fact, when all evil spirits
+
+are supposed to have unchecked sway--a blue flame is seen over any place
+
+where treasure has been concealed. �That treasure has been hidden,� he
+
+went on, �in the region through which you came last night, there can be
+
+but little doubt; for it was the ground fought over for centuries by the
+
+Wallachian, the Saxon, and the Turk. Why, there is hardly a foot of soil
+
+in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men,
+
+patriots or invaders. In old days there were stirring times, when the
+
+Austrian and the Hungarian came up in hordes, and the patriots went out
+
+to meet them--men and women, the aged and the children too--and waited
+
+their coming on the rocks above the passes, that they might sweep
+
+destruction on them with their artificial avalanches. When the invader
+
+was triumphant he found but little, for whatever there was had been
+
+sheltered in the friendly soil.�
+
+�But how,� said I, �can it have remained so long undiscovered, when
+
+there is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look?�
+
+The Count smiled, and as his lips ran back over his gums, the long,
+
+sharp, canine teeth showed out strangely; he answered:--
+
+�Because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool! Those flames only
+
+appear on one night; and on that night no man of this land will, if he
+
+can help it, stir without his doors. And, dear sir, even if he did he
+
+would not know what to do. Why, even the peasant that you tell me of who
+
+marked the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight
+
+even for his own work. Even you would not, I dare be sworn, be able to
+
+find these places again?�
+
+�There you are right,� I said. �I know no more than the dead where even
+
+to look for them.� Then we drifted into other matters.
+
+�Come,� he said at last, �tell me of London and of the house which you
+
+have procured for me.� With an apology for my remissness, I went into my
+
+own room to get the papers from my bag. Whilst I was placing them in
+
+order I heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room, and as I
+
+passed through, noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp
+
+lit, for it was by this time deep into the dark. The lamps were also lit
+
+in the study or library, and I found the Count lying on the sofa,
+
+reading, of all things in the world, an English Bradshaw�s Guide. When I
+
+came in he cleared the books and papers from the table; and with him I
+
+went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts. He was interested in
+
+everything, and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its
+
+surroundings. He clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on the
+
+subject of the neighbourhood, for he evidently at the end knew very much
+
+more than I did. When I remarked this, he answered:--
+
+�Well, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should? When I go there
+
+I shall be all alone, and my friend Harker Jonathan--nay, pardon me, I
+
+fall into my country�s habit of putting your patronymic first--my friend
+
+Jonathan Harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me. He will be
+
+in Exeter, miles away, probably working at papers of the law with my
+
+other friend, Peter Hawkins. So!�
+
+We went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at
+
+Purfleet. When I had told him the facts and got his signature to the
+
+necessary papers, and had written a letter with them ready to post to
+
+Mr. Hawkins, he began to ask me how I had come across so suitable a
+
+place. I read to him the notes which I had made at the time, and which I
+
+inscribe here:--
+
+�At Purfleet, on a by-road, I came across just such a place as seemed to
+
+be required, and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the place
+
+was for sale. It is surrounded by a high wall, of ancient structure,
+
+built of heavy stones, and has not been repaired for a large number of
+
+years. The closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron, all eaten with
+
+rust.
+
+�The estate is called Carfax, no doubt a corruption of the old _Quatre
+
+Face_, as the house is four-sided, agreeing with the cardinal points of
+
+the compass. It contains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded by
+
+the solid stone wall above mentioned. There are many trees on it, which
+
+make it in places gloomy, and there is a deep, dark-looking pond or
+
+small lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear and
+
+flows away in a fair-sized stream. The house is very large and of all
+
+periods back, I should say, to medi�val times, for one part is of stone
+
+immensely thick, with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with
+
+iron. It looks like part of a keep, and is close to an old chapel or
+
+church. I could not enter it, as I had not the key of the door leading
+
+to it from the house, but I have taken with my kodak views of it from
+
+various points. The house has been added to, but in a very straggling
+
+way, and I can only guess at the amount of ground it covers, which must
+
+be very great. There are but few houses close at hand, one being a very
+
+large house only recently added to and formed into a private lunatic
+
+asylum. It is not, however, visible from the grounds.�
+
+When I had finished, he said:--
+
+�I am glad that it is old and big. I myself am of an old family, and to
+
+live in a new house would kill me. A house cannot be made habitable in a
+
+day; and, after all, how few days go to make up a century. I rejoice
+
+also that there is a chapel of old times. We Transylvanian nobles love
+
+not to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead. I seek not
+
+gaiety nor mirth, not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and
+
+sparkling waters which please the young and gay. I am no longer young;
+
+and my heart, through weary years of mourning over the dead, is not
+
+attuned to mirth. Moreover, the walls of my castle are broken; the
+
+shadows are many, and the wind breathes cold through the broken
+
+battlements and casements. I love the shade and the shadow, and would
+
+be alone with my thoughts when I may.� Somehow his words and his look
+
+did not seem to accord, or else it was that his cast of face made his
+
+smile look malignant and saturnine.
+
+Presently, with an excuse, he left me, asking me to put all my papers
+
+together. He was some little time away, and I began to look at some of
+
+the books around me. One was an atlas, which I found opened naturally at
+
+England, as if that map had been much used. On looking at it I found in
+
+certain places little rings marked, and on examining these I noticed
+
+that one was near London on the east side, manifestly where his new
+
+estate was situated; the other two were Exeter, and Whitby on the
+
+Yorkshire coast.
+
+It was the better part of an hour when the Count returned. �Aha!� he
+
+said; �still at your books? Good! But you must not work always. Come; I
+
+am informed that your supper is ready.� He took my arm, and we went into
+
+the next room, where I found an excellent supper ready on the table. The
+
+Count again excused himself, as he had dined out on his being away from
+
+home. But he sat as on the previous night, and chatted whilst I ate.
+
+After supper I smoked, as on the last evening, and the Count stayed with
+
+me, chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject, hour
+
+after hour. I felt that it was getting very late indeed, but I did not
+
+say anything, for I felt under obligation to meet my host�s wishes in
+
+every way. I was not sleepy, as the long sleep yesterday had fortified
+
+me; but I could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at
+
+the coming of the dawn, which is like, in its way, the turn of the tide.
+
+They say that people who are near death die generally at the change to
+
+the dawn or at the turn of the tide; any one who has when tired, and
+
+tied as it were to his post, experienced this change in the atmosphere
+
+can well believe it. All at once we heard the crow of a cock coming up
+
+with preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air; Count
+
+Dracula, jumping to his feet, said:--
+
+�Why, there is the morning again! How remiss I am to let you stay up so
+
+long. You must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of
+
+England less interesting, so that I may not forget how time flies by
+
+us,� and, with a courtly bow, he quickly left me.
+
+I went into my own room and drew the curtains, but there was little to
+
+notice; my window opened into the courtyard, all I could see was the
+
+warm grey of quickening sky. So I pulled the curtains again, and have
+
+written of this day.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_8 May._--I began to fear as I wrote in this book that I was getting too
+
+diffuse; but now I am glad that I went into detail from the first, for
+
+there is something so strange about this place and all in it that I
+
+cannot but feel uneasy. I wish I were safe out of it, or that I had
+
+never come. It may be that this strange night-existence is telling on
+
+me; but would that that were all! If there were any one to talk to I
+
+could bear it, but there is no one. I have only the Count to speak with,
+
+and he!--I fear I am myself the only living soul within the place. Let
+
+me be prosaic so far as facts can be; it will help me to bear up, and
+
+imagination must not run riot with me. If it does I am lost. Let me say
+
+at once how I stand--or seem to.
+
+I only slept a few hours when I went to bed, and feeling that I could
+
+not sleep any more, got up. I had hung my shaving glass by the window,
+
+and was just beginning to shave. Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder,
+
+and heard the Count�s voice saying to me, �Good-morning.� I started, for
+
+it amazed me that I had not seen him, since the reflection of the glass
+
+covered the whole room behind me. In starting I had cut myself slightly,
+
+but did not notice it at the moment. Having answered the Count�s
+
+salutation, I turned to the glass again to see how I had been mistaken.
+
+This time there could be no error, for the man was close to me, and I
+
+could see him over my shoulder. But there was no reflection of him in
+
+the mirror! The whole room behind me was displayed; but there was no
+
+sign of a man in it, except myself. This was startling, and, coming on
+
+the top of so many strange things, was beginning to increase that vague
+
+feeling of uneasiness which I always have when the Count is near; but at
+
+the instant I saw that the cut had bled a little, and the blood was
+
+trickling over my chin. I laid down the razor, turning as I did so half
+
+round to look for some sticking plaster. When the Count saw my face, his
+
+eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury, and he suddenly made a grab at
+
+my throat. I drew away, and his hand touched the string of beads which
+
+held the crucifix. It made an instant change in him, for the fury passed
+
+so quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there.
+
+�Take care,� he said, �take care how you cut yourself. It is more
+
+dangerous than you think in this country.� Then seizing the shaving
+
+glass, he went on: �And this is the wretched thing that has done the
+
+mischief. It is a foul bauble of man�s vanity. Away with it!� and
+
+opening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand, he flung
+
+out the glass, which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones
+
+of the courtyard far below. Then he withdrew without a word. It is very
+
+annoying, for I do not see how I am to shave, unless in my watch-case or
+
+the bottom of the shaving-pot, which is fortunately of metal.
+
+When I went into the dining-room, breakfast was prepared; but I could
+
+not find the Count anywhere. So I breakfasted alone. It is strange that
+
+as yet I have not seen the Count eat or drink. He must be a very
+
+peculiar man! After breakfast I did a little exploring in the castle. I
+
+went out on the stairs, and found a room looking towards the South. The
+
+view was magnificent, and from where I stood there was every opportunity
+
+of seeing it. The castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice. A
+
+stone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet without
+
+touching anything! As far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree
+
+tops, with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm. Here and
+
+there are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through
+
+the forests.
+
+But I am not in heart to describe beauty, for when I had seen the view I
+
+explored further; doors, doors, doors everywhere, and all locked and
+
+bolted. In no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there
+
+an available exit.
+
+The castle is a veritable prison, and I am a prisoner!

+CHAPTER XII
+
+DR. SEWARD�S DIARY
+
+_18 September._--I drove at once to Hillingham and arrived early.
+
+Keeping my cab at the gate, I went up the avenue alone. I knocked gently
+
+and rang as quietly as possible, for I feared to disturb Lucy or her
+
+mother, and hoped to only bring a servant to the door. After a while,
+
+finding no response, I knocked and rang again; still no answer. I cursed
+
+the laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such an
+
+hour--for it was now ten o�clock--and so rang and knocked again, but
+
+more impatiently, but still without response. Hitherto I had blamed only
+
+the servants, but now a terrible fear began to assail me. Was this
+
+desolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing
+
+tight around us? Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come, too
+
+late? I knew that minutes, even seconds of delay, might mean hours of
+
+danger to Lucy, if she had had again one of those frightful relapses;
+
+and I went round the house to try if I could find by chance an entry
+
+anywhere.
+
+I could find no means of ingress. Every window and door was fastened and
+
+locked, and I returned baffled to the porch. As I did so, I heard the
+
+rapid pit-pat of a swiftly driven horse�s feet. They stopped at the
+
+gate, and a few seconds later I met Van Helsing running up the avenue.
+
+When he saw me, he gasped out:--
+
+�Then it was you, and just arrived. How is she? Are we too late? Did you
+
+not get my telegram?�
+
+I answered as quickly and coherently as I could that I had only got his
+
+telegram early in the morning, and had not lost a minute in coming here,
+
+and that I could not make any one in the house hear me. He paused and
+
+raised his hat as he said solemnly:--
+
+�Then I fear we are too late. God�s will be done!� With his usual
+
+recuperative energy, he went on: �Come. If there be no way open to get
+
+in, we must make one. Time is all in all to us now.�
+
+We went round to the back of the house, where there was a kitchen
+
+window. The Professor took a small surgical saw from his case, and
+
+handing it to me, pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window. I
+
+attacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them. Then
+
+with a long, thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes and
+
+opened the window. I helped the Professor in, and followed him. There
+
+was no one in the kitchen or in the servants� rooms, which were close at
+
+hand. We tried all the rooms as we went along, and in the dining-room,
+
+dimly lit by rays of light through the shutters, found four
+
+servant-women lying on the floor. There was no need to think them dead,
+
+for their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the
+
+room left no doubt as to their condition. Van Helsing and I looked at
+
+each other, and as we moved away he said: �We can attend to them later.�
+
+Then we ascended to Lucy�s room. For an instant or two we paused at the
+
+door to listen, but there was no sound that we could hear. With white
+
+faces and trembling hands, we opened the door gently, and entered the
+
+room.
+
+How shall I describe what we saw? On the bed lay two women, Lucy and her
+
+mother. The latter lay farthest in, and she was covered with a white
+
+sheet, the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through the
+
+broken window, showing the drawn, white face, with a look of terror
+
+fixed upon it. By her side lay Lucy, with face white and still more
+
+drawn. The flowers which had been round her neck we found upon her
+
+mother�s bosom, and her throat was bare, showing the two little wounds
+
+which we had noticed before, but looking horribly white and mangled.
+
+Without a word the Professor bent over the bed, his head almost touching
+
+poor Lucy�s breast; then he gave a quick turn of his head, as of one who
+
+listens, and leaping to his feet, he cried out to me:--
+
+�It is not yet too late! Quick! quick! Bring the brandy!�
+
+I flew downstairs and returned with it, taking care to smell and taste
+
+it, lest it, too, were drugged like the decanter of sherry which I found
+
+on the table. The maids were still breathing, but more restlessly, and I
+
+fancied that the narcotic was wearing off. I did not stay to make sure,
+
+but returned to Van Helsing. He rubbed the brandy, as on another
+
+occasion, on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the palms of her
+
+hands. He said to me:--
+
+�I can do this, all that can be at the present. You go wake those maids.
+
+Flick them in the face with a wet towel, and flick them hard. Make them
+
+get heat and fire and a warm bath. This poor soul is nearly as cold as
+
+that beside her. She will need be heated before we can do anything
+
+more.�
+
+I went at once, and found little difficulty in waking three of the
+
+women. The fourth was only a young girl, and the drug had evidently
+
+affected her more strongly, so I lifted her on the sofa and let her
+
+sleep. The others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came back to
+
+them they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner. I was stern with
+
+them, however, and would not let them talk. I told them that one life
+
+was bad enough to lose, and that if they delayed they would sacrifice
+
+Miss Lucy. So, sobbing and crying, they went about their way, half clad
+
+as they were, and prepared fire and water. Fortunately, the kitchen and
+
+boiler fires were still alive, and there was no lack of hot water. We
+
+got a bath and carried Lucy out as she was and placed her in it. Whilst
+
+we were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door. One
+
+of the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and opened it. Then
+
+she returned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had come
+
+with a message from Mr. Holmwood. I bade her simply tell him that he
+
+must wait, for we could see no one now. She went away with the message,
+
+and, engrossed with our work, I clean forgot all about him.
+
+I never saw in all my experience the Professor work in such deadly
+
+earnest. I knew--as he knew--that it was a stand-up fight with death,
+
+and in a pause told him so. He answered me in a way that I did not
+
+understand, but with the sternest look that his face could wear:--
+
+�If that were all, I would stop here where we are now, and let her fade
+
+away into peace, for I see no light in life over her horizon.� He went
+
+on with his work with, if possible, renewed and more frenzied vigour.
+
+Presently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning to
+
+be of some effect. Lucy�s heart beat a trifle more audibly to the
+
+stethoscope, and her lungs had a perceptible movement. Van Helsing�s
+
+face almost beamed, and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her in
+
+a hot sheet to dry her he said to me:--
+
+�The first gain is ours! Check to the King!�
+
+We took Lucy into another room, which had by now been prepared, and laid
+
+her in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat. I noticed
+
+that Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat. She was
+
+still unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we had
+
+ever seen her.
+
+Van Helsing called in one of the women, and told her to stay with her
+
+and not to take her eyes off her till we returned, and then beckoned me
+
+out of the room.
+
+�We must consult as to what is to be done,� he said as we descended the
+
+stairs. In the hall he opened the dining-room door, and we passed in, he
+
+closing the door carefully behind him. The shutters had been opened, but
+
+the blinds were already down, with that obedience to the etiquette of
+
+death which the British woman of the lower classes always rigidly
+
+observes. The room was, therefore, dimly dark. It was, however, light
+
+enough for our purposes. Van Helsing�s sternness was somewhat relieved
+
+by a look of perplexity. He was evidently torturing his mind about
+
+something, so I waited for an instant, and he spoke:--
+
+�What are we to do now? Where are we to turn for help? We must have
+
+another transfusion of blood, and that soon, or that poor girl�s life
+
+won�t be worth an hour�s purchase. You are exhausted already; I am
+
+exhausted too. I fear to trust those women, even if they would have
+
+courage to submit. What are we to do for some one who will open his
+
+veins for her?�
+
+�What�s the matter with me, anyhow?�
+
+The voice came from the sofa across the room, and its tones brought
+
+relief and joy to my heart, for they were those of Quincey Morris. Van
+
+Helsing started angrily at the first sound, but his face softened and a
+
+glad look came into his eyes as I cried out: �Quincey Morris!� and
+
+rushed towards him with outstretched hands.
+
+�What brought you here?� I cried as our hands met.
+
+�I guess Art is the cause.�
+
+He handed me a telegram:--
+
+�Have not heard from Seward for three days, and am terribly anxious.
+
+Cannot leave. Father still in same condition. Send me word how Lucy is.
+
+Do not delay.--HOLMWOOD.�
+
+�I think I came just in the nick of time. You know you have only to tell
+
+me what to do.�
+
+Van Helsing strode forward, and took his hand, looking him straight in
+
+the eyes as he said:--
+
+�A brave man�s blood is the best thing on this earth when a woman is in
+
+trouble. You�re a man and no mistake. Well, the devil may work against
+
+us for all he�s worth, but God sends us men when we want them.�
+
+Once again we went through that ghastly operation. I have not the heart
+
+to go through with the details. Lucy had got a terrible shock and it
+
+told on her more than before, for though plenty of blood went into her
+
+veins, her body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the other
+
+occasions. Her struggle back into life was something frightful to see
+
+and hear. However, the action of both heart and lungs improved, and Van
+
+Helsing made a subcutaneous injection of morphia, as before, and with
+
+good effect. Her faint became a profound slumber. The Professor watched
+
+whilst I went downstairs with Quincey Morris, and sent one of the maids
+
+to pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting. I left Quincey lying down
+
+after having a glass of wine, and told the cook to get ready a good
+
+breakfast. Then a thought struck me, and I went back to the room where
+
+Lucy now was. When I came softly in, I found Van Helsing with a sheet or
+
+two of note-paper in his hand. He had evidently read it, and was
+
+thinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow. There was a look
+
+of grim satisfaction in his face, as of one who has had a doubt solved.
+
+He handed me the paper saying only: �It dropped from Lucy�s breast when
+
+we carried her to the bath.�
+
+When I had read it, I stood looking at the Professor, and after a pause
+
+asked him: �In God�s name, what does it all mean? Was she, or is she,
+
+mad; or what sort of horrible danger is it?� I was so bewildered that I
+
+did not know what to say more. Van Helsing put out his hand and took the
+
+paper, saying:--
+
+�Do not trouble about it now. Forget it for the present. You shall know
+
+and understand it all in good time; but it will be later. And now what
+
+is it that you came to me to say?� This brought me back to fact, and I
+
+was all myself again.
+
+�I came to speak about the certificate of death. If we do not act
+
+properly and wisely, there may be an inquest, and that paper would have
+
+to be produced. I am in hopes that we need have no inquest, for if we
+
+had it would surely kill poor Lucy, if nothing else did. I know, and you
+
+know, and the other doctor who attended her knows, that Mrs. Westenra
+
+had disease of the heart, and we can certify that she died of it. Let us
+
+fill up the certificate at once, and I shall take it myself to the
+
+registrar and go on to the undertaker.�
+
+�Good, oh my friend John! Well thought of! Truly Miss Lucy, if she be
+
+sad in the foes that beset her, is at least happy in the friends that
+
+love her. One, two, three, all open their veins for her, besides one old
+
+man. Ah yes, I know, friend John; I am not blind! I love you all the
+
+more for it! Now go.�
+
+In the hall I met Quincey Morris, with a telegram for Arthur telling him
+
+that Mrs. Westenra was dead; that Lucy also had been ill, but was now
+
+going on better; and that Van Helsing and I were with her. I told him
+
+where I was going, and he hurried me out, but as I was going said:--
+
+�When you come back, Jack, may I have two words with you all to
+
+ourselves?� I nodded in reply and went out. I found no difficulty about
+
+the registration, and arranged with the local undertaker to come up in
+
+the evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements.
+
+When I got back Quincey was waiting for me. I told him I would see him
+
+as soon as I knew about Lucy, and went up to her room. She was still
+
+sleeping, and the Professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at her
+
+side. From his putting his finger to his lips, I gathered that he
+
+expected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature.
+
+So I went down to Quincey and took him into the breakfast-room, where
+
+the blinds were not drawn down, and which was a little more cheerful, or
+
+rather less cheerless, than the other rooms. When we were alone, he said
+
+to me:--
+
+�Jack Seward, I don�t want to shove myself in anywhere where I�ve no
+
+right to be; but this is no ordinary case. You know I loved that girl
+
+and wanted to marry her; but, although that�s all past and gone, I can�t
+
+help feeling anxious about her all the same. What is it that�s wrong
+
+with her? The Dutchman--and a fine old fellow he is; I can see
+
+that--said, that time you two came into the room, that you must have
+
+_another_ transfusion of blood, and that both you and he were exhausted.
+
+Now I know well that you medical men speak _in camera_, and that a man
+
+must not expect to know what they consult about in private. But this is
+
+no common matter, and, whatever it is, I have done my part. Is not that
+
+so?�
+
+�That�s so,� I said, and he went on:--
+
+�I take it that both you and Van Helsing had done already what I did
+
+to-day. Is not that so?�
+
+�That�s so.�
+
+�And I guess Art was in it too. When I saw him four days ago down at his
+
+own place he looked queer. I have not seen anything pulled down so quick
+
+since I was on the Pampas and had a mare that I was fond of go to grass
+
+all in a night. One of those big bats that they call vampires had got at
+
+her in the night, and what with his gorge and the vein left open, there
+
+wasn�t enough blood in her to let her stand up, and I had to put a
+
+bullet through her as she lay. Jack, if you may tell me without
+
+betraying confidence, Arthur was the first, is not that so?� As he spoke
+
+the poor fellow looked terribly anxious. He was in a torture of suspense
+
+regarding the woman he loved, and his utter ignorance of the terrible
+
+mystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain. His very
+
+heart was bleeding, and it took all the manhood of him--and there was a
+
+royal lot of it, too--to keep him from breaking down. I paused before
+
+answering, for I felt that I must not betray anything which the
+
+Professor wished kept secret; but already he knew so much, and guessed
+
+so much, that there could be no reason for not answering, so I answered
+
+in the same phrase: �That�s so.�
+
+�And how long has this been going on?�
+
+�About ten days.�
+
+�Ten days! Then I guess, Jack Seward, that that poor pretty creature
+
+that we all love has had put into her veins within that time the blood
+
+of four strong men. Man alive, her whole body wouldn�t hold it.� Then,
+
+coming close to me, he spoke in a fierce half-whisper: �What took it
+
+out?�
+
+I shook my head. �That,� I said, �is the crux. Van Helsing is simply
+
+frantic about it, and I am at my wits� end. I can�t even hazard a guess.
+
+There has been a series of little circumstances which have thrown out
+
+all our calculations as to Lucy being properly watched. But these shall
+
+not occur again. Here we stay until all be well--or ill.� Quincey held
+
+out his hand. �Count me in,� he said. �You and the Dutchman will tell me
+
+what to do, and I�ll do it.�
+
+When she woke late in the afternoon, Lucy�s first movement was to feel
+
+in her breast, and, to my surprise, produced the paper which Van Helsing
+
+had given me to read. The careful Professor had replaced it where it had
+
+come from, lest on waking she should be alarmed. Her eye then lit on Van
+
+Helsing and on me too, and gladdened. Then she looked around the room,
+
+and seeing where she was, shuddered; she gave a loud cry, and put her
+
+poor thin hands before her pale face. We both understood what that
+
+meant--that she had realised to the full her mother�s death; so we tried
+
+what we could to comfort her. Doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat, but
+
+she was very low in thought and spirit, and wept silently and weakly for
+
+a long time. We told her that either or both of us would now remain with
+
+her all the time, and that seemed to comfort her. Towards dusk she fell
+
+into a doze. Here a very odd thing occurred. Whilst still asleep she
+
+took the paper from her breast and tore it in two. Van Helsing stepped
+
+over and took the pieces from her. All the same, however, she went on
+
+with the action of tearing, as though the material were still in her
+
+hands; finally she lifted her hands and opened them as though scattering
+
+the fragments. Van Helsing seemed surprised, and his brows gathered as
+
+if in thought, but he said nothing.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_19 September._--All last night she slept fitfully, being always afraid
+
+to sleep, and something weaker when she woke from it. The Professor and
+
+I took it in turns to watch, and we never left her for a moment
+
+unattended. Quincey Morris said nothing about his intention, but I knew
+
+that all night long he patrolled round and round the house.
+
+When the day came, its searching light showed the ravages in poor Lucy�s
+
+strength. She was hardly able to turn her head, and the little
+
+nourishment which she could take seemed to do her no good. At times she
+
+slept, and both Van Helsing and I noticed the difference in her, between
+
+sleeping and waking. Whilst asleep she looked stronger, although more
+
+haggard, and her breathing was softer; her open mouth showed the pale
+
+gums drawn back from the teeth, which thus looked positively longer and
+
+sharper than usual; when she woke the softness of her eyes evidently
+
+changed the expression, for she looked her own self, although a dying
+
+one. In the afternoon she asked for Arthur, and we telegraphed for him.
+
+Quincey went off to meet him at the station.
+
+When he arrived it was nearly six o�clock, and the sun was setting full
+
+and warm, and the red light streamed in through the window and gave more
+
+colour to the pale cheeks. When he saw her, Arthur was simply choking
+
+with emotion, and none of us could speak. In the hours that had passed,
+
+the fits of sleep, or the comatose condition that passed for it, had
+
+grown more frequent, so that the pauses when conversation was possible
+
+were shortened. Arthur�s presence, however, seemed to act as a
+
+stimulant; she rallied a little, and spoke to him more brightly than she
+
+had done since we arrived. He too pulled himself together, and spoke as
+
+cheerily as he could, so that the best was made of everything.
+
+It was now nearly one o�clock, and he and Van Helsing are sitting with
+
+her. I am to relieve them in a quarter of an hour, and I am entering
+
+this on Lucy�s phonograph. Until six o�clock they are to try to rest. I
+
+fear that to-morrow will end our watching, for the shock has been too
+
+great; the poor child cannot rally. God help us all.
+
+_Letter, Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra._
+
+(Unopened by her.)
+
+�_17 September._
+
+�My dearest Lucy,--
+
+�It seems _an age_ since I heard from you, or indeed since I wrote. You
+
+will pardon me, I know, for all my faults when you have read all my
+
+budget of news. Well, I got my husband back all right; when we arrived
+
+at Exeter there was a carriage waiting for us, and in it, though he had
+
+an attack of gout, Mr. Hawkins. He took us to his house, where there
+
+were rooms for us all nice and comfortable, and we dined together. After
+
+dinner Mr. Hawkins said:--
+
+��My dears, I want to drink your health and prosperity; and may every
+
+blessing attend you both. I know you both from children, and have, with
+
+love and pride, seen you grow up. Now I want you to make your home here
+
+with me. I have left to me neither chick nor child; all are gone, and in
+
+my will I have left you everything.� I cried, Lucy dear, as Jonathan and
+
+the old man clasped hands. Our evening was a very, very happy one.
+
+�So here we are, installed in this beautiful old house, and from both my
+
+bedroom and the drawing-room I can see the great elms of the cathedral
+
+close, with their great black stems standing out against the old yellow
+
+stone of the cathedral and I can hear the rooks overhead cawing and
+
+cawing and chattering and gossiping all day, after the manner of
+
+rooks--and humans. I am busy, I need not tell you, arranging things and
+
+housekeeping. Jonathan and Mr. Hawkins are busy all day; for, now that
+
+Jonathan is a partner, Mr. Hawkins wants to tell him all about the
+
+clients.
+
+�How is your dear mother getting on? I wish I could run up to town for a
+
+day or two to see you, dear, but I dare not go yet, with so much on my
+
+shoulders; and Jonathan wants looking after still. He is beginning to
+
+put some flesh on his bones again, but he was terribly weakened by the
+
+long illness; even now he sometimes starts out of his sleep in a sudden
+
+way and awakes all trembling until I can coax him back to his usual
+
+placidity. However, thank God, these occasions grow less frequent as the
+
+days go on, and they will in time pass away altogether, I trust. And now
+
+I have told you my news, let me ask yours. When are you to be married,
+
+and where, and who is to perform the ceremony, and what are you to wear,
+
+and is it to be a public or a private wedding? Tell me all about it,
+
+dear; tell me all about everything, for there is nothing which interests
+
+you which will not be dear to me. Jonathan asks me to send his
+
+�respectful duty,� but I do not think that is good enough from the
+
+junior partner of the important firm Hawkins & Harker; and so, as you
+
+love me, and he loves me, and I love you with all the moods and tenses
+
+of the verb, I send you simply his �love� instead. Good-bye, my dearest
+
+Lucy, and all blessings on you.
+
+�Yours,
+
+�MINA HARKER.�

+_Report from Patrick Hennessey, M. D., M. R. C. S. L. K. Q. C. P. I.,
+
+etc., etc., to John Seward, M. D._
+
+�_20 September._
+
+�My dear Sir,--
+
+�In accordance with your wishes, I enclose report of the conditions of
+
+everything left in my charge.... With regard to patient, Renfield, there
+
+is more to say. He has had another outbreak, which might have had a
+
+dreadful ending, but which, as it fortunately happened, was unattended
+
+with any unhappy results. This afternoon a carrier�s cart with two men
+
+made a call at the empty house whose grounds abut on ours--the house to
+
+which, you will remember, the patient twice ran away. The men stopped at
+
+our gate to ask the porter their way, as they were strangers. I was
+
+myself looking out of the study window, having a smoke after dinner, and
+
+saw one of them come up to the house. As he passed the window of
+
+Renfield�s room, the patient began to rate him from within, and called
+
+him all the foul names he could lay his tongue to. The man, who seemed a
+
+decent fellow enough, contented himself by telling him to �shut up for a
+
+foul-mouthed beggar,� whereon our man accused him of robbing him and
+
+wanting to murder him and said that he would hinder him if he were to
+
+swing for it. I opened the window and signed to the man not to notice,
+
+so he contented himself after looking the place over and making up his
+
+mind as to what kind of a place he had got to by saying: �Lor� bless
+
+yer, sir, I wouldn�t mind what was said to me in a bloomin� madhouse. I
+
+pity ye and the guv�nor for havin� to live in the house with a wild
+
+beast like that.� Then he asked his way civilly enough, and I told him
+
+where the gate of the empty house was; he went away, followed by threats
+
+and curses and revilings from our man. I went down to see if I could
+
+make out any cause for his anger, since he is usually such a
+
+well-behaved man, and except his violent fits nothing of the kind had
+
+ever occurred. I found him, to my astonishment, quite composed and most
+
+genial in his manner. I tried to get him to talk of the incident, but he
+
+blandly asked me questions as to what I meant, and led me to believe
+
+that he was completely oblivious of the affair. It was, I am sorry to
+
+say, however, only another instance of his cunning, for within half an
+
+hour I heard of him again. This time he had broken out through the
+
+window of his room, and was running down the avenue. I called to the
+
+attendants to follow me, and ran after him, for I feared he was intent
+
+on some mischief. My fear was justified when I saw the same cart which
+
+had passed before coming down the road, having on it some great wooden
+
+boxes. The men were wiping their foreheads, and were flushed in the
+
+face, as if with violent exercise. Before I could get up to him the
+
+patient rushed at them, and pulling one of them off the cart, began to
+
+knock his head against the ground. If I had not seized him just at the
+
+moment I believe he would have killed the man there and then. The other
+
+fellow jumped down and struck him over the head with the butt-end of his
+
+heavy whip. It was a terrible blow; but he did not seem to mind it, but
+
+seized him also, and struggled with the three of us, pulling us to and
+
+fro as if we were kittens. You know I am no light weight, and the others
+
+were both burly men. At first he was silent in his fighting; but as we
+
+began to master him, and the attendants were putting a strait-waistcoat
+
+on him, he began to shout: �I�ll frustrate them! They shan�t rob me!
+
+they shan�t murder me by inches! I�ll fight for my Lord and Master!� and
+
+all sorts of similar incoherent ravings. It was with very considerable
+
+difficulty that they got him back to the house and put him in the padded
+
+room. One of the attendants, Hardy, had a finger broken. However, I set
+
+it all right; and he is going on well.
+
+�The two carriers were at first loud in their threats of actions for
+
+damages, and promised to rain all the penalties of the law on us. Their
+
+threats were, however, mingled with some sort of indirect apology for
+
+the defeat of the two of them by a feeble madman. They said that if it
+
+had not been for the way their strength had been spent in carrying and
+
+raising the heavy boxes to the cart they would have made short work of
+
+him. They gave as another reason for their defeat the extraordinary
+
+state of drouth to which they had been reduced by the dusty nature of
+
+their occupation and the reprehensible distance from the scene of their
+
+labours of any place of public entertainment. I quite understood their
+
+drift, and after a stiff glass of grog, or rather more of the same, and
+
+with each a sovereign in hand, they made light of the attack, and swore
+
+that they would encounter a worse madman any day for the pleasure of
+
+meeting so �bloomin� good a bloke� as your correspondent. I took their
+
+names and addresses, in case they might be needed. They are as
+
+follows:--Jack Smollet, of Dudding�s Rents, King George�s Road, Great
+
+Walworth, and Thomas Snelling, Peter Farley�s Row, Guide Court, Bethnal
+
+Green. They are both in the employment of Harris & Sons, Moving and
+
+Shipment Company, Orange Master�s Yard, Soho.
+
+�I shall report to you any matter of interest occurring here, and shall
+
+wire you at once if there is anything of importance.
+
+�Believe me, dear Sir,
+
+�Yours faithfully,
+
+�PATRICK HENNESSEY.�
+
+_Letter, Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra_.
+
+(Unopened by her.)
+
+�_18 September._
+
+�My dearest Lucy,--
+
+�Such a sad blow has befallen us. Mr. Hawkins has died very suddenly.
+
+Some may not think it so sad for us, but we had both come to so love him
+
+that it really seems as though we had lost a father. I never knew either
+
+father or mother, so that the dear old man�s death is a real blow to me.
+
+Jonathan is greatly distressed. It is not only that he feels sorrow,
+
+deep sorrow, for the dear, good man who has befriended him all his life,
+
+and now at the end has treated him like his own son and left him a
+
+fortune which to people of our modest bringing up is wealth beyond the
+
+dream of avarice, but Jonathan feels it on another account. He says the
+
+amount of responsibility which it puts upon him makes him nervous. He
+
+begins to doubt himself. I try to cheer him up, and _my_ belief in _him_
+
+helps him to have a belief in himself. But it is here that the grave
+
+shock that he experienced tells upon him the most. Oh, it is too hard
+
+that a sweet, simple, noble, strong nature such as his--a nature which
+
+enabled him by our dear, good friend�s aid to rise from clerk to master
+
+in a few years--should be so injured that the very essence of its
+
+strength is gone. Forgive me, dear, if I worry you with my troubles in
+
+the midst of your own happiness; but, Lucy dear, I must tell some one,
+
+for the strain of keeping up a brave and cheerful appearance to Jonathan
+
+tries me, and I have no one here that I can confide in. I dread coming
+
+up to London, as we must do the day after to-morrow; for poor Mr.
+
+Hawkins left in his will that he was to be buried in the grave with his
+
+father. As there are no relations at all, Jonathan will have to be chief
+
+mourner. I shall try to run over to see you, dearest, if only for a few
+
+minutes. Forgive me for troubling you. With all blessings,
+
+�Your loving
+
+�MINA HARKER.�
+
+_Dr. Seward�s Diary._
+
+_20 September._--Only resolution and habit can let me make an entry
+
+to-night. I am too miserable, too low-spirited, too sick of the world
+
+and all in it, including life itself, that I would not care if I heard
+
+this moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death. And he has
+
+been flapping those grim wings to some purpose of late--Lucy�s mother
+
+and Arthur�s father, and now.... Let me get on with my work.
+
+I duly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over Lucy. We wanted Arthur to
+
+go to rest also, but he refused at first. It was only when I told him
+
+that we should want him to help us during the day, and that we must not
+
+all break down for want of rest, lest Lucy should suffer, that he agreed
+
+to go. Van Helsing was very kind to him. �Come, my child,� he said;
+
+�come with me. You are sick and weak, and have had much sorrow and much
+
+mental pain, as well as that tax on your strength that we know of. You
+
+must not be alone; for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms.
+
+Come to the drawing-room, where there is a big fire, and there are two
+
+sofas. You shall lie on one, and I on the other, and our sympathy will
+
+be comfort to each other, even though we do not speak, and even if we
+
+sleep.� Arthur went off with him, casting back a longing look on Lucy�s
+
+face, which lay in her pillow, almost whiter than the lawn. She lay
+
+quite still, and I looked round the room to see that all was as it
+
+should be. I could see that the Professor had carried out in this room,
+
+as in the other, his purpose of using the garlic; the whole of the
+
+window-sashes reeked with it, and round Lucy�s neck, over the silk
+
+handkerchief which Van Helsing made her keep on, was a rough chaplet of
+
+the same odorous flowers. Lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously, and
+
+her face was at its worst, for the open mouth showed the pale gums. Her
+
+teeth, in the dim, uncertain light, seemed longer and sharper than they
+
+had been in the morning. In particular, by some trick of the light, the
+
+canine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest. I sat down by her,
+
+and presently she moved uneasily. At the same moment there came a sort
+
+of dull flapping or buffeting at the window. I went over to it softly,
+
+and peeped out by the corner of the blind. There was a full moonlight,
+
+and I could see that the noise was made by a great bat, which wheeled
+
+round--doubtless attracted by the light, although so dim--and every now
+
+and again struck the window with its wings. When I came back to my seat,
+
+I found that Lucy had moved slightly, and had torn away the garlic
+
+flowers from her throat. I replaced them as well as I could, and sat
+
+watching her.
+
+Presently she woke, and I gave her food, as Van Helsing had prescribed.
+
+She took but a little, and that languidly. There did not seem to be with
+
+her now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hitherto
+
+so marked her illness. It struck me as curious that the moment she
+
+became conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her. It was
+
+certainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state, with the
+
+stertorous breathing, she put the flowers from her; but that when she
+
+waked she clutched them close. There was no possibility of making any
+
+mistake about this, for in the long hours that followed, she had many
+
+spells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times.
+
+At six o�clock Van Helsing came to relieve me. Arthur had then fallen
+
+into a doze, and he mercifully let him sleep on. When he saw Lucy�s face
+
+I could hear the sissing indraw of his breath, and he said to me in a
+
+sharp whisper: �Draw up the blind; I want light!� Then he bent down,
+
+and, with his face almost touching Lucy�s, examined her carefully. He
+
+removed the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat. As
+
+he did so he started back, and I could hear his ejaculation, �Mein
+
+Gott!� as it was smothered in his throat. I bent over and looked, too,
+
+and as I noticed some queer chill came over me.
+
+The wounds on the throat had absolutely disappeared.
+
+For fully five minutes Van Helsing stood looking at her, with his face
+
+at its sternest. Then he turned to me and said calmly:--
+
+�She is dying. It will not be long now. It will be much difference, mark
+
+me, whether she dies conscious or in her sleep. Wake that poor boy, and
+
+let him come and see the last; he trusts us, and we have promised him.�
+
+I went to the dining-room and waked him. He was dazed for a moment, but
+
+when he saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges of the shutters
+
+he thought he was late, and expressed his fear. I assured him that Lucy
+
+was still asleep, but told him as gently as I could that both Van
+
+Helsing and I feared that the end was near. He covered his face with his
+
+hands, and slid down on his knees by the sofa, where he remained,
+
+perhaps a minute, with his head buried, praying, whilst his shoulders
+
+shook with grief. I took him by the hand and raised him up. �Come,� I
+
+said, �my dear old fellow, summon all your fortitude: it will be best
+
+and easiest for her.�
+
+When we came into Lucy�s room I could see that Van Helsing had, with
+
+his usual forethought, been putting matters straight and making
+
+everything look as pleasing as possible. He had even brushed Lucy�s
+
+hair, so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples. When we
+
+came into the room she opened her eyes, and seeing him, whispered
+
+softly:--
+
+�Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come!� He was stooping to
+
+kiss her, when Van Helsing motioned him back. �No,� he whispered, �not
+
+yet! Hold her hand; it will comfort her more.�
+
+So Arthur took her hand and knelt beside her, and she looked her best,
+
+with all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes. Then
+
+gradually her eyes closed, and she sank to sleep. For a little bit her
+
+breast heaved softly, and her breath came and went like a tired child�s.
+
+And then insensibly there came the strange change which I had noticed in
+
+the night. Her breathing grew stertorous, the mouth opened, and the pale
+
+gums, drawn back, made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever. In a
+
+sort of sleep-waking, vague, unconscious way she opened her eyes, which
+
+were now dull and hard at once, and said in a soft, voluptuous voice,
+
+such as I had never heard from her lips:--
+
+�Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come! Kiss me!� Arthur bent
+
+eagerly over to kiss her; but at that instant Van Helsing, who, like me,
+
+had been startled by her voice, swooped upon him, and catching him by
+
+the neck with both hands, dragged him back with a fury of strength which
+
+I never thought he could have possessed, and actually hurled him almost
+
+across the room.
+
+�Not for your life!� he said; �not for your living soul and hers!� And
+
+he stood between them like a lion at bay.
+
+Arthur was so taken aback that he did not for a moment know what to do
+
+or say; and before any impulse of violence could seize him he realised
+
+the place and the occasion, and stood silent, waiting.
+
+I kept my eyes fixed on Lucy, as did Van Helsing, and we saw a spasm as
+
+of rage flit like a shadow over her face; the sharp teeth champed
+
+together. Then her eyes closed, and she breathed heavily.
+
+Very shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness, and
+
+putting out her poor, pale, thin hand, took Van Helsing�s great brown
+
+one; drawing it to her, she kissed it. �My true friend,� she said, in a
+
+faint voice, but with untellable pathos, �My true friend, and his! Oh,
+
+guard him, and give me peace!�
+
+�I swear it!� he said solemnly, kneeling beside her and holding up his
+
+hand, as one who registers an oath. Then he turned to Arthur, and said
+
+to him: �Come, my child, take her hand in yours, and kiss her on the
+
+forehead, and only once.�
+
+Their eyes met instead of their lips; and so they parted.
+
+Lucy�s eyes closed; and Van Helsing, who had been watching closely, took
+
+Arthur�s arm, and drew him away.
+
+And then Lucy�s breathing became stertorous again, and all at once it
+
+ceased.
+
+�It is all over,� said Van Helsing. �She is dead!�
+
+I took Arthur by the arm, and led him away to the drawing-room, where he
+
+sat down, and covered his face with his hands, sobbing in a way that
+
+nearly broke me down to see.
+
+I went back to the room, and found Van Helsing looking at poor Lucy, and
+
+his face was sterner than ever. Some change had come over her body.
+
+Death had given back part of her beauty, for her brow and cheeks had
+
+recovered some of their flowing lines; even the lips had lost their
+
+deadly pallor. It was as if the blood, no longer needed for the working
+
+of the heart, had gone to make the harshness of death as little rude as
+
+might be.
+
+�We thought her dying whilst she slept,
+
+And sleeping when she died.�
+
+I stood beside Van Helsing, and said:--
+
+�Ah, well, poor girl, there is peace for her at last. It is the end!�
+
+He turned to me, and said with grave solemnity:--
+
+�Not so; alas! not so. It is only the beginning!�
+
+When I asked him what he meant, he only shook his head and answered:--
+
+�We can do nothing as yet. Wait and see.�

+CHAPTER IX
+
+_Letter, Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra._
+
+�_Buda-Pesth, 24 August._
+
+�My dearest Lucy,--
+
+�I know you will be anxious to hear all that has happened since we
+
+parted at the railway station at Whitby. Well, my dear, I got to Hull
+
+all right, and caught the boat to Hamburg, and then the train on here. I
+
+feel that I can hardly recall anything of the journey, except that I
+
+knew I was coming to Jonathan, and, that as I should have to do some
+
+nursing, I had better get all the sleep I could.... I found my dear one,
+
+oh, so thin and pale and weak-looking. All the resolution has gone out
+
+of his dear eyes, and that quiet dignity which I told you was in his
+
+face has vanished. He is only a wreck of himself, and he does not
+
+remember anything that has happened to him for a long time past. At
+
+least, he wants me to believe so, and I shall never ask. He has had some
+
+terrible shock, and I fear it might tax his poor brain if he were to try
+
+to recall it. Sister Agatha, who is a good creature and a born nurse,
+
+tells me that he raved of dreadful things whilst he was off his head. I
+
+wanted her to tell me what they were; but she would only cross herself,
+
+and say she would never tell; that the ravings of the sick were the
+
+secrets of God, and that if a nurse through her vocation should hear
+
+them, she should respect her trust. She is a sweet, good soul, and the
+
+next day, when she saw I was troubled, she opened up the subject again,
+
+and after saying that she could never mention what my poor dear raved
+
+about, added: �I can tell you this much, my dear: that it was not about
+
+anything which he has done wrong himself; and you, as his wife to be,
+
+have no cause to be concerned. He has not forgotten you or what he owes
+
+to you. His fear was of great and terrible things, which no mortal can
+
+treat of.� I do believe the dear soul thought I might be jealous lest my
+
+poor dear should have fallen in love with any other girl. The idea of
+
+_my_ being jealous about Jonathan! And yet, my dear, let me whisper, I
+
+felt a thrill of joy through me when I _knew_ that no other woman was a
+
+cause of trouble. I am now sitting by his bedside, where I can see his
+
+face while he sleeps. He is waking!...
+
+�When he woke he asked me for his coat, as he wanted to get something
+
+from the pocket; I asked Sister Agatha, and she brought all his things.
+
+I saw that amongst them was his note-book, and was going to ask him to
+
+let me look at it--for I knew then that I might find some clue to his
+
+trouble--but I suppose he must have seen my wish in my eyes, for he sent
+
+me over to the window, saying he wanted to be quite alone for a moment.
+
+Then he called me back, and when I came he had his hand over the
+
+note-book, and he said to me very solemnly:--
+
+��Wilhelmina�--I knew then that he was in deadly earnest, for he has
+
+never called me by that name since he asked me to marry him--�you know,
+
+dear, my ideas of the trust between husband and wife: there should be no
+
+secret, no concealment. I have had a great shock, and when I try to
+
+think of what it is I feel my head spin round, and I do not know if it
+
+was all real or the dreaming of a madman. You know I have had brain
+
+fever, and that is to be mad. The secret is here, and I do not want to
+
+know it. I want to take up my life here, with our marriage.� For, my
+
+dear, we had decided to be married as soon as the formalities are
+
+complete. �Are you willing, Wilhelmina, to share my ignorance? Here is
+
+the book. Take it and keep it, read it if you will, but never let me
+
+know; unless, indeed, some solemn duty should come upon me to go back to
+
+the bitter hours, asleep or awake, sane or mad, recorded here.� He fell
+
+back exhausted, and I put the book under his pillow, and kissed him. I
+
+have asked Sister Agatha to beg the Superior to let our wedding be this
+
+afternoon, and am waiting her reply....
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+�She has come and told me that the chaplain of the English mission
+
+church has been sent for. We are to be married in an hour, or as soon
+
+after as Jonathan awakes....
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+�Lucy, the time has come and gone. I feel very solemn, but very, very
+
+happy. Jonathan woke a little after the hour, and all was ready, and he
+
+sat up in bed, propped up with pillows. He answered his �I will� firmly
+
+and strongly. I could hardly speak; my heart was so full that even those
+
+words seemed to choke me. The dear sisters were so kind. Please God, I
+
+shall never, never forget them, nor the grave and sweet responsibilities
+
+I have taken upon me. I must tell you of my wedding present. When the
+
+chaplain and the sisters had left me alone with my husband--oh, Lucy, it
+
+is the first time I have written the words �my husband�--left me alone
+
+with my husband, I took the book from under his pillow, and wrapped it
+
+up in white paper, and tied it with a little bit of pale blue ribbon
+
+which was round my neck, and sealed it over the knot with sealing-wax,
+
+and for my seal I used my wedding ring. Then I kissed it and showed it
+
+to my husband, and told him that I would keep it so, and then it would
+
+be an outward and visible sign for us all our lives that we trusted each
+
+other; that I would never open it unless it were for his own dear sake
+
+or for the sake of some stern duty. Then he took my hand in his, and oh,
+
+Lucy, it was the first time he took _his wife�s_ hand, and said that it
+
+was the dearest thing in all the wide world, and that he would go
+
+through all the past again to win it, if need be. The poor dear meant to
+
+have said a part of the past, but he cannot think of time yet, and I
+
+shall not wonder if at first he mixes up not only the month, but the
+
+year.
+
+�Well, my dear, what could I say? I could only tell him that I was the
+
+happiest woman in all the wide world, and that I had nothing to give him
+
+except myself, my life, and my trust, and that with these went my love
+
+and duty for all the days of my life. And, my dear, when he kissed me,
+
+and drew me to him with his poor weak hands, it was like a very solemn
+
+pledge between us....
+
+�Lucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this? It is not only because
+
+it is all sweet to me, but because you have been, and are, very dear to
+
+me. It was my privilege to be your friend and guide when you came from
+
+the schoolroom to prepare for the world of life. I want you to see now,
+
+and with the eyes of a very happy wife, whither duty has led me; so that
+
+in your own married life you too may be all happy as I am. My dear,
+
+please Almighty God, your life may be all it promises: a long day of
+
+sunshine, with no harsh wind, no forgetting duty, no distrust. I must
+
+not wish you no pain, for that can never be; but I do hope you will be
+
+_always_ as happy as I am _now_. Good-bye, my dear. I shall post this at
+
+once, and, perhaps, write you very soon again. I must stop, for Jonathan
+
+is waking--I must attend to my husband!
+
+�Your ever-loving
+
+�MINA HARKER.�
+
+_Letter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Harker._
+
+�_Whitby, 30 August._
+
+�My dearest Mina,--
+
+�Oceans of love and millions of kisses, and may you soon be in your own
+
+home with your husband. I wish you could be coming home soon enough to
+
+stay with us here. The strong air would soon restore Jonathan; it has
+
+quite restored me. I have an appetite like a cormorant, am full of
+
+life, and sleep well. You will be glad to know that I have quite given
+
+up walking in my sleep. I think I have not stirred out of my bed for a
+
+week, that is when I once got into it at night. Arthur says I am getting
+
+fat. By the way, I forgot to tell you that Arthur is here. We have such
+
+walks and drives, and rides, and rowing, and tennis, and fishing
+
+together; and I love him more than ever. He _tells_ me that he loves me
+
+more, but I doubt that, for at first he told me that he couldn�t love me
+
+more than he did then. But this is nonsense. There he is, calling to me.
+
+So no more just at present from your loving
+
+�LUCY.
+
+�P. S.--Mother sends her love. She seems better, poor dear.
+
+�P. P. S.--We are to be married on 28 September.�
+
+_Dr. Seward�s Diary._
+
+_20 August._--The case of Renfield grows even more interesting. He has
+
+now so far quieted that there are spells of cessation from his passion.
+
+For the first week after his attack he was perpetually violent. Then one
+
+night, just as the moon rose, he grew quiet, and kept murmuring to
+
+himself: �Now I can wait; now I can wait.� The attendant came to tell
+
+me, so I ran down at once to have a look at him. He was still in the
+
+strait-waistcoat and in the padded room, but the suffused look had gone
+
+from his face, and his eyes had something of their old pleading--I might
+
+almost say, �cringing�--softness. I was satisfied with his present
+
+condition, and directed him to be relieved. The attendants hesitated,
+
+but finally carried out my wishes without protest. It was a strange
+
+thing that the patient had humour enough to see their distrust, for,
+
+coming close to me, he said in a whisper, all the while looking
+
+furtively at them:--
+
+�They think I could hurt you! Fancy _me_ hurting _you_! The fools!�
+
+It was soothing, somehow, to the feelings to find myself dissociated
+
+even in the mind of this poor madman from the others; but all the same I
+
+do not follow his thought. Am I to take it that I have anything in
+
+common with him, so that we are, as it were, to stand together; or has
+
+he to gain from me some good so stupendous that my well-being is needful
+
+to him? I must find out later on. To-night he will not speak. Even the
+
+offer of a kitten or even a full-grown cat will not tempt him. He will
+
+only say: �I don�t take any stock in cats. I have more to think of now,
+
+and I can wait; I can wait.�
+
+After a while I left him. The attendant tells me that he was quiet
+
+until just before dawn, and that then he began to get uneasy, and at
+
+length violent, until at last he fell into a paroxysm which exhausted
+
+him so that he swooned into a sort of coma.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+... Three nights has the same thing happened--violent all day then quiet
+
+from moonrise to sunrise. I wish I could get some clue to the cause. It
+
+would almost seem as if there was some influence which came and went.
+
+Happy thought! We shall to-night play sane wits against mad ones. He
+
+escaped before without our help; to-night he shall escape with it. We
+
+shall give him a chance, and have the men ready to follow in case they
+
+are required....
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_23 August._--�The unexpected always happens.� How well Disraeli knew
+
+life. Our bird when he found the cage open would not fly, so all our
+
+subtle arrangements were for nought. At any rate, we have proved one
+
+thing; that the spells of quietness last a reasonable time. We shall in
+
+future be able to ease his bonds for a few hours each day. I have given
+
+orders to the night attendant merely to shut him in the padded room,
+
+when once he is quiet, until an hour before sunrise. The poor soul�s
+
+body will enjoy the relief even if his mind cannot appreciate it. Hark!
+
+The unexpected again! I am called; the patient has once more escaped.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_Later._--Another night adventure. Renfield artfully waited until the
+
+attendant was entering the room to inspect. Then he dashed out past him
+
+and flew down the passage. I sent word for the attendants to follow.
+
+Again he went into the grounds of the deserted house, and we found him
+
+in the same place, pressed against the old chapel door. When he saw me
+
+he became furious, and had not the attendants seized him in time, he
+
+would have tried to kill me. As we were holding him a strange thing
+
+happened. He suddenly redoubled his efforts, and then as suddenly grew
+
+calm. I looked round instinctively, but could see nothing. Then I caught
+
+the patient�s eye and followed it, but could trace nothing as it looked
+
+into the moonlit sky except a big bat, which was flapping its silent and
+
+ghostly way to the west. Bats usually wheel and flit about, but this one
+
+seemed to go straight on, as if it knew where it was bound for or had
+
+some intention of its own. The patient grew calmer every instant, and
+
+presently said:--
+
+�You needn�t tie me; I shall go quietly!� Without trouble we came back
+
+to the house. I feel there is something ominous in his calm, and shall
+
+not forget this night....
+
+_Lucy Westenra�s Diary_
+
+_Hillingham, 24 August._--I must imitate Mina, and keep writing things
+
+down. Then we can have long talks when we do meet. I wonder when it will
+
+be. I wish she were with me again, for I feel so unhappy. Last night I
+
+seemed to be dreaming again just as I was at Whitby. Perhaps it is the
+
+change of air, or getting home again. It is all dark and horrid to me,
+
+for I can remember nothing; but I am full of vague fear, and I feel so
+
+weak and worn out. When Arthur came to lunch he looked quite grieved
+
+when he saw me, and I hadn�t the spirit to try to be cheerful. I wonder
+
+if I could sleep in mother�s room to-night. I shall make an excuse and
+
+try.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_25 August._--Another bad night. Mother did not seem to take to my
+
+proposal. She seems not too well herself, and doubtless she fears to
+
+worry me. I tried to keep awake, and succeeded for a while; but when the
+
+clock struck twelve it waked me from a doze, so I must have been falling
+
+asleep. There was a sort of scratching or flapping at the window, but I
+
+did not mind it, and as I remember no more, I suppose I must then have
+
+fallen asleep. More bad dreams. I wish I could remember them. This
+
+morning I am horribly weak. My face is ghastly pale, and my throat pains
+
+me. It must be something wrong with my lungs, for I don�t seem ever to
+
+get air enough. I shall try to cheer up when Arthur comes, or else I
+
+know he will be miserable to see me so.
+
+_Letter, Arthur Holmwood to Dr. Seward._
+
+�_Albemarle Hotel, 31 August._
+
+�My dear Jack,--
+
+�I want you to do me a favour. Lucy is ill; that is, she has no special
+
+disease, but she looks awful, and is getting worse every day. I have
+
+asked her if there is any cause; I do not dare to ask her mother, for to
+
+disturb the poor lady�s mind about her daughter in her present state of
+
+health would be fatal. Mrs. Westenra has confided to me that her doom is
+
+spoken--disease of the heart--though poor Lucy does not know it yet. I
+
+am sure that there is something preying on my dear girl�s mind. I am
+
+almost distracted when I think of her; to look at her gives me a pang. I
+
+told her I should ask you to see her, and though she demurred at
+
+first--I know why, old fellow--she finally consented. It will be a
+
+painful task for you, I know, old friend, but it is for _her_ sake, and
+
+I must not hesitate to ask, or you to act. You are to come to lunch at
+
+Hillingham to-morrow, two o�clock, so as not to arouse any suspicion in
+
+Mrs. Westenra, and after lunch Lucy will take an opportunity of being
+
+alone with you. I shall come in for tea, and we can go away together; I
+
+am filled with anxiety, and want to consult with you alone as soon as I
+
+can after you have seen her. Do not fail!
+
+�ARTHUR.�
+
+_Telegram, Arthur Holmwood to Seward._
+
+�_1 September._
+
+�Am summoned to see my father, who is worse. Am writing. Write me fully
+
+by to-night�s post to Ring. Wire me if necessary.�
+
+_Letter from Dr. Seward to Arthur Holmwood._
+
+�_2 September._
+
+�My dear old fellow,--
+
+�With regard to Miss Westenra�s health I hasten to let you know at once
+
+that in my opinion there is not any functional disturbance or any malady
+
+that I know of. At the same time, I am not by any means satisfied with
+
+her appearance; she is woefully different from what she was when I saw
+
+her last. Of course you must bear in mind that I did not have full
+
+opportunity of examination such as I should wish; our very friendship
+
+makes a little difficulty which not even medical science or custom can
+
+bridge over. I had better tell you exactly what happened, leaving you to
+
+draw, in a measure, your own conclusions. I shall then say what I have
+
+done and propose doing.
+
+�I found Miss Westenra in seemingly gay spirits. Her mother was present,
+
+and in a few seconds I made up my mind that she was trying all she knew
+
+to mislead her mother and prevent her from being anxious. I have no
+
+doubt she guesses, if she does not know, what need of caution there is.
+
+We lunched alone, and as we all exerted ourselves to be cheerful, we
+
+got, as some kind of reward for our labours, some real cheerfulness
+
+amongst us. Then Mrs. Westenra went to lie down, and Lucy was left with
+
+me. We went into her boudoir, and till we got there her gaiety remained,
+
+for the servants were coming and going. As soon as the door was closed,
+
+however, the mask fell from her face, and she sank down into a chair
+
+with a great sigh, and hid her eyes with her hand. When I saw that her
+
+high spirits had failed, I at once took advantage of her reaction to
+
+make a diagnosis. She said to me very sweetly:--
+
+��I cannot tell you how I loathe talking about myself.� I reminded her
+
+that a doctor�s confidence was sacred, but that you were grievously
+
+anxious about her. She caught on to my meaning at once, and settled that
+
+matter in a word. �Tell Arthur everything you choose. I do not care for
+
+myself, but all for him!� So I am quite free.
+
+�I could easily see that she is somewhat bloodless, but I could not see
+
+the usual an�mic signs, and by a chance I was actually able to test the
+
+quality of her blood, for in opening a window which was stiff a cord
+
+gave way, and she cut her hand slightly with broken glass. It was a
+
+slight matter in itself, but it gave me an evident chance, and I secured
+
+a few drops of the blood and have analysed them. The qualitative
+
+analysis gives a quite normal condition, and shows, I should infer, in
+
+itself a vigorous state of health. In other physical matters I was quite
+
+satisfied that there is no need for anxiety; but as there must be a
+
+cause somewhere, I have come to the conclusion that it must be something
+
+mental. She complains of difficulty in breathing satisfactorily at
+
+times, and of heavy, lethargic sleep, with dreams that frighten her, but
+
+regarding which she can remember nothing. She says that as a child she
+
+used to walk in her sleep, and that when in Whitby the habit came back,
+
+and that once she walked out in the night and went to East Cliff, where
+
+Miss Murray found her; but she assures me that of late the habit has not
+
+returned. I am in doubt, and so have done the best thing I know of; I
+
+have written to my old friend and master, Professor Van Helsing, of
+
+Amsterdam, who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one in the
+
+world. I have asked him to come over, and as you told me that all things
+
+were to be at your charge, I have mentioned to him who you are and your
+
+relations to Miss Westenra. This, my dear fellow, is in obedience to
+
+your wishes, for I am only too proud and happy to do anything I can for
+
+her. Van Helsing would, I know, do anything for me for a personal
+
+reason, so, no matter on what ground he comes, we must accept his
+
+wishes. He is a seemingly arbitrary man, but this is because he knows
+
+what he is talking about better than any one else. He is a philosopher
+
+and a metaphysician, and one of the most advanced scientists of his day;
+
+and he has, I believe, an absolutely open mind. This, with an iron
+
+nerve, a temper of the ice-brook, an indomitable resolution,
+
+self-command, and toleration exalted from virtues to blessings, and the
+
+kindliest and truest heart that beats--these form his equipment for the
+
+noble work that he is doing for mankind--work both in theory and
+
+practice, for his views are as wide as his all-embracing sympathy. I
+
+tell you these facts that you may know why I have such confidence in
+
+him. I have asked him to come at once. I shall see Miss Westenra
+
+to-morrow again. She is to meet me at the Stores, so that I may not
+
+alarm her mother by too early a repetition of my call.
+
+�Yours always,
+
+�JOHN SEWARD.�

+
+�When I have received your letter I am already coming to you. By good
+
+fortune I can leave just at once, without wrong to any of those who have
+
+trusted me. Were fortune other, then it were bad for those who have
+
+trusted, for I come to my friend when he call me to aid those he holds
+
+dear. Tell your friend that when that time you suck from my wound so
+
+swiftly the poison of the gangrene from that knife that our other
+
+friend, too nervous, let slip, you did more for him when he wants my
+
+aids and you call for them than all his great fortune could do. But it
+
+is pleasure added to do for him, your friend; it is to you that I come.
+
+Have then rooms for me at the Great Eastern Hotel, so that I may be near
+
+to hand, and please it so arrange that we may see the young lady not too
+
+late on to-morrow, for it is likely that I may have to return here that
+
+night. But if need be I shall come again in three days, and stay longer
+
+if it must. Till then good-bye, my friend John.
+
+�VAN HELSING.�
+
+_Letter, Dr. Seward to Hon. Arthur Holmwood._
+
+�_3 September._
+
+�My dear Art,--
+
+�Van Helsing has come and gone. He came on with me to Hillingham, and
+
+found that, by Lucy�s discretion, her mother was lunching out, so that
+
+we were alone with her. Van Helsing made a very careful examination of
+
+the patient. He is to report to me, and I shall advise you, for of
+
+course I was not present all the time. He is, I fear, much concerned,
+
+but says he must think. When I told him of our friendship and how you
+
+trust to me in the matter, he said: �You must tell him all you think.
+
+Tell him what I think, if you can guess it, if you will. Nay, I am not
+
+jesting. This is no jest, but life and death, perhaps more.� I asked
+
+what he meant by that, for he was very serious. This was when we had
+
+come back to town, and he was having a cup of tea before starting on his
+
+return to Amsterdam. He would not give me any further clue. You must not
+
+be angry with me, Art, because his very reticence means that all his
+
+brains are working for her good. He will speak plainly enough when the
+
+time comes, be sure. So I told him I would simply write an account of
+
+our visit, just as if I were doing a descriptive special article for
+
+_The Daily Telegraph_. He seemed not to notice, but remarked that the
+
+smuts in London were not quite so bad as they used to be when he was a
+
+student here. I am to get his report to-morrow if he can possibly make
+
+it. In any case I am to have a letter.
+
+�Well, as to the visit. Lucy was more cheerful than on the day I first
+
+saw her, and certainly looked better. She had lost something of the
+
+ghastly look that so upset you, and her breathing was normal. She was
+
+very sweet to the professor (as she always is), and tried to make him
+
+feel at ease; though I could see that the poor girl was making a hard
+
+struggle for it. I believe Van Helsing saw it, too, for I saw the quick
+
+look under his bushy brows that I knew of old. Then he began to chat of
+
+all things except ourselves and diseases and with such an infinite
+
+geniality that I could see poor Lucy�s pretense of animation merge into
+
+reality. Then, without any seeming change, he brought the conversation
+
+gently round to his visit, and suavely said:--
+
+��My dear young miss, I have the so great pleasure because you are so
+
+much beloved. That is much, my dear, ever were there that which I do not
+
+see. They told me you were down in the spirit, and that you were of a
+
+ghastly pale. To them I say: �Pouf!�� And he snapped his fingers at me
+
+and went on: �But you and I shall show them how wrong they are. How can
+
+he�--and he pointed at me with the same look and gesture as that with
+
+which once he pointed me out to his class, on, or rather after, a
+
+particular occasion which he never fails to remind me of--�know anything
+
+of a young ladies? He has his madmans to play with, and to bring them
+
+back to happiness, and to those that love them. It is much to do, and,
+
+oh, but there are rewards, in that we can bestow such happiness. But the
+
+young ladies! He has no wife nor daughter, and the young do not tell
+
+themselves to the young, but to the old, like me, who have known so many
+
+sorrows and the causes of them. So, my dear, we will send him away to
+
+smoke the cigarette in the garden, whiles you and I have little talk all
+
+to ourselves.� I took the hint, and strolled about, and presently the
+
+professor came to the window and called me in. He looked grave, but
+
+said: �I have made careful examination, but there is no functional
+
+cause. With you I agree that there has been much blood lost; it has
+
+been, but is not. But the conditions of her are in no way an�mic. I have
+
+asked her to send me her maid, that I may ask just one or two question,
+
+that so I may not chance to miss nothing. I know well what she will say.
+
+And yet there is cause; there is always cause for everything. I must go
+
+back home and think. You must send to me the telegram every day; and if
+
+there be cause I shall come again. The disease--for not to be all well
+
+is a disease--interest me, and the sweet young dear, she interest me
+
+too. She charm me, and for her, if not for you or disease, I come.�
+
+�As I tell you, he would not say a word more, even when we were alone.
+
+And so now, Art, you know all I know. I shall keep stern watch. I trust
+
+your poor father is rallying. It must be a terrible thing to you, my
+
+dear old fellow, to be placed in such a position between two people who
+
+are both so dear to you. I know your idea of duty to your father, and
+
+you are right to stick to it; but, if need be, I shall send you word to
+
+come at once to Lucy; so do not be over-anxious unless you hear from
+
+me.�
+
+_Dr. Seward�s Diary._
+
+_4 September._--Zo�phagous patient still keeps up our interest in him.
+
+He had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time. Just
+
+before the stroke of noon he began to grow restless. The attendant knew
+
+the symptoms, and at once summoned aid. Fortunately the men came at a
+
+run, and were just in time, for at the stroke of noon he became so
+
+violent that it took all their strength to hold him. In about five
+
+minutes, however, he began to get more and more quiet, and finally sank
+
+into a sort of melancholy, in which state he has remained up to now. The
+
+attendant tells me that his screams whilst in the paroxysm were really
+
+appalling; I found my hands full when I got in, attending to some of the
+
+other patients who were frightened by him. Indeed, I can quite
+
+understand the effect, for the sounds disturbed even me, though I was
+
+some distance away. It is now after the dinner-hour of the asylum, and
+
+as yet my patient sits in a corner brooding, with a dull, sullen,
+
+woe-begone look in his face, which seems rather to indicate than to show
+
+something directly. I cannot quite understand it.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_Later._--Another change in my patient. At five o�clock I looked in on
+
+him, and found him seemingly as happy and contented as he used to be. He
+
+was catching flies and eating them, and was keeping note of his capture
+
+by making nail-marks on the edge of the door between the ridges of
+
+padding. When he saw me, he came over and apologised for his bad
+
+conduct, and asked me in a very humble, cringing way to be led back to
+
+his own room and to have his note-book again. I thought it well to
+
+humour him: so he is back in his room with the window open. He has the
+
+sugar of his tea spread out on the window-sill, and is reaping quite a
+
+harvest of flies. He is not now eating them, but putting them into a
+
+box, as of old, and is already examining the corners of his room to find
+
+a spider. I tried to get him to talk about the past few days, for any
+
+clue to his thoughts would be of immense help to me; but he would not
+
+rise. For a moment or two he looked very sad, and said in a sort of
+
+far-away voice, as though saying it rather to himself than to me:--
+
+�All over! all over! He has deserted me. No hope for me now unless I do
+
+it for myself!� Then suddenly turning to me in a resolute way, he said:
+
+�Doctor, won�t you be very good to me and let me have a little more
+
+sugar? I think it would be good for me.�
+
+�And the flies?� I said.
+
+�Yes! The flies like it, too, and I like the flies; therefore I like
+
+it.� And there are people who know so little as to think that madmen do
+
+not argue. I procured him a double supply, and left him as happy a man
+
+as, I suppose, any in the world. I wish I could fathom his mind.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_Midnight._--Another change in him. I had been to see Miss Westenra,
+
+whom I found much better, and had just returned, and was standing at our
+
+own gate looking at the sunset, when once more I heard him yelling. As
+
+his room is on this side of the house, I could hear it better than in
+
+the morning. It was a shock to me to turn from the wonderful smoky
+
+beauty of a sunset over London, with its lurid lights and inky shadows
+
+and all the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even as on foul
+
+water, and to realise all the grim sternness of my own cold stone
+
+building, with its wealth of breathing misery, and my own desolate heart
+
+to endure it all. I reached him just as the sun was going down, and from
+
+his window saw the red disc sink. As it sank he became less and less
+
+frenzied; and just as it dipped he slid from the hands that held him, an
+
+inert mass, on the floor. It is wonderful, however, what intellectual
+
+recuperative power lunatics have, for within a few minutes he stood up
+
+quite calmly and looked around him. I signalled to the attendants not to
+
+hold him, for I was anxious to see what he would do. He went straight
+
+over to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar; then he took his
+
+fly-box, and emptied it outside, and threw away the box; then he shut
+
+the window, and crossing over, sat down on his bed. All this surprised
+
+me, so I asked him: �Are you not going to keep flies any more?�
+
+�No,� said he; �I am sick of all that rubbish!� He certainly is a
+
+wonderfully interesting study. I wish I could get some glimpse of his
+
+mind or of the cause of his sudden passion. Stop; there may be a clue
+
+after all, if we can find why to-day his paroxysms came on at high noon
+
+and at sunset. Can it be that there is a malign influence of the sun at
+
+periods which affects certain natures--as at times the moon does others?
+
+We shall see.

+CHAPTER X
+
+_Letter, Dr. Seward to Hon. Arthur Holmwood._
+
+�_6 September._
+
+�My dear Art,--
+
+�My news to-day is not so good. Lucy this morning had gone back a bit.
+
+There is, however, one good thing which has arisen from it; Mrs.
+
+Westenra was naturally anxious concerning Lucy, and has consulted me
+
+professionally about her. I took advantage of the opportunity, and told
+
+her that my old master, Van Helsing, the great specialist, was coming to
+
+stay with me, and that I would put her in his charge conjointly with
+
+myself; so now we can come and go without alarming her unduly, for a
+
+shock to her would mean sudden death, and this, in Lucy�s weak
+
+condition, might be disastrous to her. We are hedged in with
+
+difficulties, all of us, my poor old fellow; but, please God, we shall
+
+come through them all right. If any need I shall write, so that, if you
+
+do not hear from me, take it for granted that I am simply waiting for
+
+news. In haste
+
+�Yours ever,
+
+�JOHN SEWARD.�
+
+_Dr. Seward�s Diary._
+
+_7 September._--The first thing Van Helsing said to me when we met at
+
+Liverpool Street was:--
+
+�Have you said anything to our young friend the lover of her?�
+
+�No,� I said. �I waited till I had seen you, as I said in my telegram. I
+
+wrote him a letter simply telling him that you were coming, as Miss
+
+Westenra was not so well, and that I should let him know if need be.�
+
+�Right, my friend,� he said, �quite right! Better he not know as yet;
+
+perhaps he shall never know. I pray so; but if it be needed, then he
+
+shall know all. And, my good friend John, let me caution you. You deal
+
+with the madmen. All men are mad in some way or the other; and inasmuch
+
+as you deal discreetly with your madmen, so deal with God�s madmen,
+
+too--the rest of the world. You tell not your madmen what you do nor why
+
+you do it; you tell them not what you think. So you shall keep knowledge
+
+in its place, where it may rest--where it may gather its kind around it
+
+and breed. You and I shall keep as yet what we know here, and here.� He
+
+touched me on the heart and on the forehead, and then touched himself
+
+the same way. �I have for myself thoughts at the present. Later I shall
+
+unfold to you.�
+
+�Why not now?� I asked. �It may do some good; we may arrive at some
+
+decision.� He stopped and looked at me, and said:--
+
+�My friend John, when the corn is grown, even before it has
+
+ripened--while the milk of its mother-earth is in him, and the sunshine
+
+has not yet begun to paint him with his gold, the husbandman he pull the
+
+ear and rub him between his rough hands, and blow away the green chaff,
+
+and say to you: �Look! he�s good corn; he will make good crop when the
+
+time comes.�� I did not see the application, and told him so. For reply
+
+he reached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully, as
+
+he used long ago to do at lectures, and said: �The good husbandman tell
+
+you so then because he knows, but not till then. But you do not find the
+
+good husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if he grow; that is for
+
+the children who play at husbandry, and not for those who take it as of
+
+the work of their life. See you now, friend John? I have sown my corn,
+
+and Nature has her work to do in making it sprout; if he sprout at all,
+
+there�s some promise; and I wait till the ear begins to swell.� He broke
+
+off, for he evidently saw that I understood. Then he went on, and very
+
+gravely:--
+
+�You were always a careful student, and your case-book was ever more
+
+full than the rest. You were only student then; now you are master, and
+
+I trust that good habit have not fail. Remember, my friend, that
+
+knowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not trust the weaker.
+
+Even if you have not kept the good practise, let me tell you that this
+
+case of our dear miss is one that may be--mind, I say _may be_--of such
+
+interest to us and others that all the rest may not make him kick the
+
+beam, as your peoples say. Take then good note of it. Nothing is too
+
+small. I counsel you, put down in record even your doubts and surmises.
+
+Hereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess. We
+
+learn from failure, not from success!�
+
+When I described Lucy�s symptoms--the same as before, but infinitely
+
+more marked--he looked very grave, but said nothing. He took with him a
+
+bag in which were many instruments and drugs, �the ghastly paraphernalia
+
+of our beneficial trade,� as he once called, in one of his lectures, the
+
+equipment of a professor of the healing craft. When we were shown in,
+
+Mrs. Westenra met us. She was alarmed, but not nearly so much as I
+
+expected to find her. Nature in one of her beneficent moods has ordained
+
+that even death has some antidote to its own terrors. Here, in a case
+
+where any shock may prove fatal, matters are so ordered that, from some
+
+cause or other, the things not personal--even the terrible change in her
+
+daughter to whom she is so attached--do not seem to reach her. It is
+
+something like the way Dame Nature gathers round a foreign body an
+
+envelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil that
+
+which it would otherwise harm by contact. If this be an ordered
+
+selfishness, then we should pause before we condemn any one for the vice
+
+of egoism, for there may be deeper root for its causes than we have
+
+knowledge of.
+
+I used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology, and laid down
+
+a rule that she should not be present with Lucy or think of her illness
+
+more than was absolutely required. She assented readily, so readily that
+
+I saw again the hand of Nature fighting for life. Van Helsing and I were
+
+shown up to Lucy�s room. If I was shocked when I saw her yesterday, I
+
+was horrified when I saw her to-day. She was ghastly, chalkily pale; the
+
+red seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums, and the bones of
+
+her face stood out prominently; her breathing was painful to see or
+
+hear. Van Helsing�s face grew set as marble, and his eyebrows converged
+
+till they almost touched over his nose. Lucy lay motionless, and did not
+
+seem to have strength to speak, so for a while we were all silent. Then
+
+Van Helsing beckoned to me, and we went gently out of the room. The
+
+instant we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage to
+
+the next door, which was open. Then he pulled me quickly in with him and
+
+closed the door. �My God!� he said; �this is dreadful. There is no time
+
+to be lost. She will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heart�s
+
+action as it should be. There must be transfusion of blood at once. Is
+
+it you or me?�
+
+�I am younger and stronger, Professor. It must be me.�
+
+�Then get ready at once. I will bring up my bag. I am prepared.�
+
+I went downstairs with him, and as we were going there was a knock at
+
+the hall-door. When we reached the hall the maid had just opened the
+
+door, and Arthur was stepping quickly in. He rushed up to me, saying in
+
+an eager whisper:--
+
+�Jack, I was so anxious. I read between the lines of your letter, and
+
+have been in an agony. The dad was better, so I ran down here to see for
+
+myself. Is not that gentleman Dr. Van Helsing? I am so thankful to you,
+
+sir, for coming.� When first the Professor�s eye had lit upon him he had
+
+been angry at his interruption at such a time; but now, as he took in
+
+his stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young manhood which
+
+seemed to emanate from him, his eyes gleamed. Without a pause he said to
+
+him gravely as he held out his hand:--
+
+�Sir, you have come in time. You are the lover of our dear miss. She is
+
+bad, very, very bad. Nay, my child, do not go like that.� For he
+
+suddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting. �You are to
+
+help her. You can do more than any that live, and your courage is your
+
+best help.�
+
+�What can I do?� asked Arthur hoarsely. �Tell me, and I shall do it. My
+
+life is hers, and I would give the last drop of blood in my body for
+
+her.� The Professor has a strongly humorous side, and I could from old
+
+knowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer:--
+
+�My young sir, I do not ask so much as that--not the last!�
+
+�What shall I do?� There was fire in his eyes, and his open nostril
+
+quivered with intent. Van Helsing slapped him on the shoulder. �Come!�
+
+he said. �You are a man, and it is a man we want. You are better than
+
+me, better than my friend John.� Arthur looked bewildered, and the
+
+Professor went on by explaining in a kindly way:--
+
+�Young miss is bad, very bad. She wants blood, and blood she must have
+
+or die. My friend John and I have consulted; and we are about to perform
+
+what we call transfusion of blood--to transfer from full veins of one to
+
+the empty veins which pine for him. John was to give his blood, as he is
+
+the more young and strong than me�--here Arthur took my hand and wrung
+
+it hard in silence--�but, now you are here, you are more good than us,
+
+old or young, who toil much in the world of thought. Our nerves are not
+
+so calm and our blood not so bright than yours!� Arthur turned to him
+
+and said:--
+
+�If you only knew how gladly I would die for her you would
+
+understand----�
+
+He stopped, with a sort of choke in his voice.
+
+�Good boy!� said Van Helsing. �In the not-so-far-off you will be happy
+
+that you have done all for her you love. Come now and be silent. You
+
+shall kiss her once before it is done, but then you must go; and you
+
+must leave at my sign. Say no word to Madame; you know how it is with
+
+her! There must be no shock; any knowledge of this would be one. Come!�
+
+We all went up to Lucy�s room. Arthur by direction remained outside.
+
+Lucy turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing. She was not
+
+asleep, but she was simply too weak to make the effort. Her eyes spoke
+
+to us; that was all. Van Helsing took some things from his bag and laid
+
+them on a little table out of sight. Then he mixed a narcotic, and
+
+coming over to the bed, said cheerily:--
+
+�Now, little miss, here is your medicine. Drink it off, like a good
+
+child. See, I lift you so that to swallow is easy. Yes.� She had made
+
+the effort with success.
+
+It astonished me how long the drug took to act. This, in fact, marked
+
+the extent of her weakness. The time seemed endless until sleep began to
+
+flicker in her eyelids. At last, however, the narcotic began to manifest
+
+its potency; and she fell into a deep sleep. When the Professor was
+
+satisfied he called Arthur into the room, and bade him strip off his
+
+coat. Then he added: �You may take that one little kiss whiles I bring
+
+over the table. Friend John, help to me!� So neither of us looked whilst
+
+he bent over her.
+
+Van Helsing turning to me, said:
+
+�He is so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need not
+
+defibrinate it.�
+
+Then with swiftness, but with absolute method, Van Helsing performed the
+
+operation. As the transfusion went on something like life seemed to come
+
+back to poor Lucy�s cheeks, and through Arthur�s growing pallor the joy
+
+of his face seemed absolutely to shine. After a bit I began to grow
+
+anxious, for the loss of blood was telling on Arthur, strong man as he
+
+was. It gave me an idea of what a terrible strain Lucy�s system must
+
+have undergone that what weakened Arthur only partially restored her.
+
+But the Professor�s face was set, and he stood watch in hand and with
+
+his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on Arthur. I could hear my own
+
+heart beat. Presently he said in a soft voice: �Do not stir an instant.
+
+It is enough. You attend him; I will look to her.� When all was over I
+
+could see how much Arthur was weakened. I dressed the wound and took his
+
+arm to bring him away, when Van Helsing spoke without turning round--the
+
+man seems to have eyes in the back of his head:--
+
+�The brave lover, I think, deserve another kiss, which he shall have
+
+presently.� And as he had now finished his operation, he adjusted the
+
+pillow to the patient�s head. As he did so the narrow black velvet band
+
+which she seems always to wear round her throat, buckled with an old
+
+diamond buckle which her lover had given her, was dragged a little up,
+
+and showed a red mark on her throat. Arthur did not notice it, but I
+
+could hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of Van Helsing�s
+
+ways of betraying emotion. He said nothing at the moment, but turned to
+
+me, saying: �Now take down our brave young lover, give him of the port
+
+wine, and let him lie down a while. He must then go home and rest, sleep
+
+much and eat much, that he may be recruited of what he has so given to
+
+his love. He must not stay here. Hold! a moment. I may take it, sir,
+
+that you are anxious of result. Then bring it with you that in all ways
+
+the operation is successful. You have saved her life this time, and you
+
+can go home and rest easy in mind that all that can be is. I shall tell
+
+her all when she is well; she shall love you none the less for what you
+
+have done. Good-bye.�
+
+When Arthur had gone I went back to the room. Lucy was sleeping gently,
+
+but her breathing was stronger; I could see the counterpane move as her
+
+breast heaved. By the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at her intently.
+
+The velvet band again covered the red mark. I asked the Professor in a
+
+whisper:--
+
+�What do you make of that mark on her throat?�
+
+�What do you make of it?�
+
+�I have not examined it yet,� I answered, and then and there proceeded
+
+to loose the band. Just over the external jugular vein there were two
+
+punctures, not large, but not wholesome-looking. There was no sign of
+
+disease, but the edges were white and worn-looking, as if by some
+
+trituration. It at once occurred to me that this wound, or whatever it
+
+was, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood; but I abandoned
+
+the idea as soon as formed, for such a thing could not be. The whole bed
+
+would have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl must
+
+have lost to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusion.
+
+�Well?� said Van Helsing.
+
+�Well,� said I, �I can make nothing of it.� The Professor stood up. �I
+
+must go back to Amsterdam to-night,� he said. �There are books and
+
+things there which I want. You must remain here all the night, and you
+
+must not let your sight pass from her.�
+
+�Shall I have a nurse?� I asked.
+
+�We are the best nurses, you and I. You keep watch all night; see that
+
+she is well fed, and that nothing disturbs her. You must not sleep all
+
+the night. Later on we can sleep, you and I. I shall be back as soon as
+
+possible. And then we may begin.�
+
+�May begin?� I said. �What on earth do you mean?�
+
+�We shall see!� he answered, as he hurried out. He came back a moment
+
+later and put his head inside the door and said with warning finger held
+
+up:--
+
+�Remember, she is your charge. If you leave her, and harm befall, you
+
+shall not sleep easy hereafter!�
+
+_Dr. Seward�s Diary--continued._
+
+_8 September._--I sat up all night with Lucy. The opiate worked itself
+
+off towards dusk, and she waked naturally; she looked a different being
+
+from what she had been before the operation. Her spirits even were good,
+
+and she was full of a happy vivacity, but I could see evidences of the
+
+absolute prostration which she had undergone. When I told Mrs. Westenra
+
+that Dr. Van Helsing had directed that I should sit up with her she
+
+almost pooh-poohed the idea, pointing out her daughter�s renewed
+
+strength and excellent spirits. I was firm, however, and made
+
+preparations for my long vigil. When her maid had prepared her for the
+
+night I came in, having in the meantime had supper, and took a seat by
+
+the bedside. She did not in any way make objection, but looked at me
+
+gratefully whenever I caught her eye. After a long spell she seemed
+
+sinking off to sleep, but with an effort seemed to pull herself together
+
+and shook it off. This was repeated several times, with greater effort
+
+and with shorter pauses as the time moved on. It was apparent that she
+
+did not want to sleep, so I tackled the subject at once:--
+
+�You do not want to go to sleep?�
+
+�No; I am afraid.�
+
+�Afraid to go to sleep! Why so? It is the boon we all crave for.�
+
+�Ah, not if you were like me--if sleep was to you a presage of horror!�
+
+�A presage of horror! What on earth do you mean?�
+
+�I don�t know; oh, I don�t know. And that is what is so terrible. All
+
+this weakness comes to me in sleep; until I dread the very thought.�
+
+�But, my dear girl, you may sleep to-night. I am here watching you, and
+
+I can promise that nothing will happen.�
+
+�Ah, I can trust you!� I seized the opportunity, and said: �I promise
+
+you that if I see any evidence of bad dreams I will wake you at once.�
+
+�You will? Oh, will you really? How good you are to me. Then I will
+
+sleep!� And almost at the word she gave a deep sigh of relief, and sank
+
+back, asleep.
+
+All night long I watched by her. She never stirred, but slept on and on
+
+in a deep, tranquil, life-giving, health-giving sleep. Her lips were
+
+slightly parted, and her breast rose and fell with the regularity of a
+
+pendulum. There was a smile on her face, and it was evident that no bad
+
+dreams had come to disturb her peace of mind.
+
+In the early morning her maid came, and I left her in her care and took
+
+myself back home, for I was anxious about many things. I sent a short
+
+wire to Van Helsing and to Arthur, telling them of the excellent result
+
+of the operation. My own work, with its manifold arrears, took me all
+
+day to clear off; it was dark when I was able to inquire about my
+
+zo�phagous patient. The report was good; he had been quite quiet for the
+
+past day and night. A telegram came from Van Helsing at Amsterdam whilst
+
+I was at dinner, suggesting that I should be at Hillingham to-night, as
+
+it might be well to be at hand, and stating that he was leaving by the
+
+night mail and would join me early in the morning.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_9 September_.--I was pretty tired and worn out when I got to
+
+Hillingham. For two nights I had hardly had a wink of sleep, and my
+
+brain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebral
+
+exhaustion. Lucy was up and in cheerful spirits. When she shook hands
+
+with me she looked sharply in my face and said:--
+
+�No sitting up to-night for you. You are worn out. I am quite well
+
+again; indeed, I am; and if there is to be any sitting up, it is I who
+
+will sit up with you.� I would not argue the point, but went and had my
+
+supper. Lucy came with me, and, enlivened by her charming presence, I
+
+made an excellent meal, and had a couple of glasses of the more than
+
+excellent port. Then Lucy took me upstairs, and showed me a room next
+
+her own, where a cozy fire was burning. �Now,� she said, �you must stay
+
+here. I shall leave this door open and my door too. You can lie on the
+
+sofa for I know that nothing would induce any of you doctors to go to
+
+bed whilst there is a patient above the horizon. If I want anything I
+
+shall call out, and you can come to me at once.� I could not but
+
+acquiesce, for I was �dog-tired,� and could not have sat up had I tried.
+
+So, on her renewing her promise to call me if she should want anything,
+
+I lay on the sofa, and forgot all about everything.
+
+_Lucy Westenra�s Diary._
+
+_9 September._--I feel so happy to-night. I have been so miserably weak,
+
+that to be able to think and move about is like feeling sunshine after
+
+a long spell of east wind out of a steel sky. Somehow Arthur feels very,
+
+very close to me. I seem to feel his presence warm about me. I suppose
+
+it is that sickness and weakness are selfish things and turn our inner
+
+eyes and sympathy on ourselves, whilst health and strength give Love
+
+rein, and in thought and feeling he can wander where he wills. I know
+
+where my thoughts are. If Arthur only knew! My dear, my dear, your ears
+
+must tingle as you sleep, as mine do waking. Oh, the blissful rest of
+
+last night! How I slept, with that dear, good Dr. Seward watching me.
+
+And to-night I shall not fear to sleep, since he is close at hand and
+
+within call. Thank everybody for being so good to me! Thank God!
+
+Good-night, Arthur.
+
+_Dr. Seward�s Diary._
+
+_10 September._--I was conscious of the Professor�s hand on my head, and
+
+started awake all in a second. That is one of the things that we learn
+
+in an asylum, at any rate.
+
+�And how is our patient?�
+
+�Well, when I left her, or rather when she left me,� I answered.
+
+�Come, let us see,� he said. And together we went into the room.
+
+The blind was down, and I went over to raise it gently, whilst Van
+
+Helsing stepped, with his soft, cat-like tread, over to the bed.
+
+As I raised the blind, and the morning sunlight flooded the room, I
+
+heard the Professor�s low hiss of inspiration, and knowing its rarity, a
+
+deadly fear shot through my heart. As I passed over he moved back, and
+
+his exclamation of horror, �Gott in Himmel!� needed no enforcement from
+
+his agonised face. He raised his hand and pointed to the bed, and his
+
+iron face was drawn and ashen white. I felt my knees begin to tremble.
+
+There on the bed, seemingly in a swoon, lay poor Lucy, more horribly
+
+white and wan-looking than ever. Even the lips were white, and the gums
+
+seemed to have shrunken back from the teeth, as we sometimes see in a
+
+corpse after a prolonged illness. Van Helsing raised his foot to stamp
+
+in anger, but the instinct of his life and all the long years of habit
+
+stood to him, and he put it down again softly. �Quick!� he said. �Bring
+
+the brandy.� I flew to the dining-room, and returned with the decanter.
+
+He wetted the poor white lips with it, and together we rubbed palm and
+
+wrist and heart. He felt her heart, and after a few moments of agonising
+
+suspense said:--
+
+�It is not too late. It beats, though but feebly. All our work is
+
+undone; we must begin again. There is no young Arthur here now; I have
+
+to call on you yourself this time, friend John.� As he spoke, he was
+
+dipping into his bag and producing the instruments for transfusion; I
+
+had taken off my coat and rolled up my shirt-sleeve. There was no
+
+possibility of an opiate just at present, and no need of one; and so,
+
+without a moment�s delay, we began the operation. After a time--it did
+
+not seem a short time either, for the draining away of one�s blood, no
+
+matter how willingly it be given, is a terrible feeling--Van Helsing
+
+held up a warning finger. �Do not stir,� he said, �but I fear that with
+
+growing strength she may wake; and that would make danger, oh, so much
+
+danger. But I shall precaution take. I shall give hypodermic injection
+
+of morphia.� He proceeded then, swiftly and deftly, to carry out his
+
+intent. The effect on Lucy was not bad, for the faint seemed to merge
+
+subtly into the narcotic sleep. It was with a feeling of personal pride
+
+that I could see a faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallid
+
+cheeks and lips. No man knows, till he experiences it, what it is to
+
+feel his own life-blood drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves.
+
+The Professor watched me critically. �That will do,� he said. �Already?�
+
+I remonstrated. �You took a great deal more from Art.� To which he
+
+smiled a sad sort of smile as he replied:--
+
+�He is her lover, her _fianc�_. You have work, much work, to do for her
+
+and for others; and the present will suffice.�
+
+When we stopped the operation, he attended to Lucy, whilst I applied
+
+digital pressure to my own incision. I laid down, whilst I waited his
+
+leisure to attend to me, for I felt faint and a little sick. By-and-by
+
+he bound up my wound, and sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine for
+
+myself. As I was leaving the room, he came after me, and half
+
+whispered:--
+
+�Mind, nothing must be said of this. If our young lover should turn up
+
+unexpected, as before, no word to him. It would at once frighten him and
+
+enjealous him, too. There must be none. So!�
+
+When I came back he looked at me carefully, and then said:--
+
+�You are not much the worse. Go into the room, and lie on your sofa, and
+
+rest awhile; then have much breakfast, and come here to me.�
+
+I followed out his orders, for I knew how right and wise they were. I
+
+had done my part, and now my next duty was to keep up my strength. I
+
+felt very weak, and in the weakness lost something of the amazement at
+
+what had occurred. I fell asleep on the sofa, however, wondering over
+
+and over again how Lucy had made such a retrograde movement, and how
+
+she could have been drained of so much blood with no sign anywhere to
+
+show for it. I think I must have continued my wonder in my dreams, for,
+
+sleeping and waking, my thoughts always came back to the little
+
+punctures in her throat and the ragged, exhausted appearance of their
+
+edges--tiny though they were.
+
+Lucy slept well into the day, and when she woke she was fairly well and
+
+strong, though not nearly so much so as the day before. When Van Helsing
+
+had seen her, he went out for a walk, leaving me in charge, with strict
+
+injunctions that I was not to leave her for a moment. I could hear his
+
+voice in the hall, asking the way to the nearest telegraph office.
+
+Lucy chatted with me freely, and seemed quite unconscious that anything
+
+had happened. I tried to keep her amused and interested. When her mother
+
+came up to see her, she did not seem to notice any change whatever, but
+
+said to me gratefully:--
+
+�We owe you so much, Dr. Seward, for all you have done, but you really
+
+must now take care not to overwork yourself. You are looking pale
+
+yourself. You want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit; that you
+
+do!� As she spoke, Lucy turned crimson, though it was only momentarily,
+
+for her poor wasted veins could not stand for long such an unwonted
+
+drain to the head. The reaction came in excessive pallor as she turned
+
+imploring eyes on me. I smiled and nodded, and laid my finger on my
+
+lips; with a sigh, she sank back amid her pillows.
+
+Van Helsing returned in a couple of hours, and presently said to me:
+
+�Now you go home, and eat much and drink enough. Make yourself strong. I
+
+stay here to-night, and I shall sit up with little miss myself. You and
+
+I must watch the case, and we must have none other to know. I have grave
+
+reasons. No, do not ask them; think what you will. Do not fear to think
+
+even the most not-probable. Good-night.�
+
+In the hall two of the maids came to me, and asked if they or either of
+
+them might not sit up with Miss Lucy. They implored me to let them; and
+
+when I said it was Dr. Van Helsing�s wish that either he or I should sit
+
+up, they asked me quite piteously to intercede with the �foreign
+
+gentleman.� I was much touched by their kindness. Perhaps it is because
+
+I am weak at present, and perhaps because it was on Lucy�s account, that
+
+their devotion was manifested; for over and over again have I seen
+
+similar instances of woman�s kindness. I got back here in time for a
+
+late dinner; went my rounds--all well; and set this down whilst waiting
+
+for sleep. It is coming.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_11 September._--This afternoon I went over to Hillingham. Found Van
+
+Helsing in excellent spirits, and Lucy much better. Shortly after I had
+
+arrived, a big parcel from abroad came for the Professor. He opened it
+
+with much impressment--assumed, of course--and showed a great bundle of
+
+white flowers.
+
+�These are for you, Miss Lucy,� he said.
+
+�For me? Oh, Dr. Van Helsing!�
+
+�Yes, my dear, but not for you to play with. These are medicines.� Here
+
+Lucy made a wry face. �Nay, but they are not to take in a decoction or
+
+in nauseous form, so you need not snub that so charming nose, or I shall
+
+point out to my friend Arthur what woes he may have to endure in seeing
+
+so much beauty that he so loves so much distort. Aha, my pretty miss,
+
+that bring the so nice nose all straight again. This is medicinal, but
+
+you do not know how. I put him in your window, I make pretty wreath, and
+
+hang him round your neck, so that you sleep well. Oh yes! they, like the
+
+lotus flower, make your trouble forgotten. It smell so like the waters
+
+of Lethe, and of that fountain of youth that the Conquistadores sought
+
+for in the Floridas, and find him all too late.�
+
+Whilst he was speaking, Lucy had been examining the flowers and smelling
+
+them. Now she threw them down, saying, with half-laughter, and
+
+half-disgust:--
+
+�Oh, Professor, I believe you are only putting up a joke on me. Why,
+
+these flowers are only common garlic.�
+
+To my surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said with all his sternness, his
+
+iron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting:--
+
+�No trifling with me! I never jest! There is grim purpose in all I do;
+
+and I warn you that you do not thwart me. Take care, for the sake of
+
+others if not for your own.� Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she might
+
+well be, he went on more gently: �Oh, little miss, my dear, do not fear
+
+me. I only do for your good; but there is much virtue to you in those so
+
+common flowers. See, I place them myself in your room. I make myself the
+
+wreath that you are to wear. But hush! no telling to others that make so
+
+inquisitive questions. We must obey, and silence is a part of obedience;
+
+and obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that wait
+
+for you. Now sit still awhile. Come with me, friend John, and you shall
+
+help me deck the room with my garlic, which is all the way from Haarlem,
+
+where my friend Vanderpool raise herb in his glass-houses all the year.
+
+I had to telegraph yesterday, or they would not have been here.�
+
+We went into the room, taking the flowers with us. The Professor�s
+
+actions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopoeia
+
+that I ever heard of. First he fastened up the windows and latched them
+
+securely; next, taking a handful of the flowers, he rubbed them all over
+
+the sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get
+
+in would be laden with the garlic smell. Then with the wisp he rubbed
+
+all over the jamb of the door, above, below, and at each side, and round
+
+the fireplace in the same way. It all seemed grotesque to me, and
+
+presently I said:--
+
+�Well, Professor, I know you always have a reason for what you do, but
+
+this certainly puzzles me. It is well we have no sceptic here, or he
+
+would say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit.�
+
+�Perhaps I am!� he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath which
+
+Lucy was to wear round her neck.
+
+We then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night, and when she
+
+was in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round her
+
+neck. The last words he said to her were:--
+
+�Take care you do not disturb it; and even if the room feel close, do
+
+not to-night open the window or the door.�
+
+�I promise,� said Lucy, �and thank you both a thousand times for all
+
+your kindness to me! Oh, what have I done to be blessed with such
+
+friends?�
+
+As we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, Van Helsing said:--
+
+�To-night I can sleep in peace, and sleep I want--two nights of travel,
+
+much reading in the day between, and much anxiety on the day to follow,
+
+and a night to sit up, without to wink. To-morrow in the morning early
+
+you call for me, and we come together to see our pretty miss, so much
+
+more strong for my �spell� which I have work. Ho! ho!�
+
+He seemed so confident that I, remembering my own confidence two nights
+
+before and with the baneful result, felt awe and vague terror. It must
+
+have been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it to my friend, but
+
+I felt it all the more, like unshed tears.

+CHAPTER XVII
+
+DR. SEWARD�S DIARY--_continued_
+
+When we arrived at the Berkeley Hotel, Van Helsing found a telegram
+
+waiting for him:--
+
+�Am coming up by train. Jonathan at Whitby. Important news.--MINA
+
+HARKER.�
+
+The Professor was delighted. �Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina,� he said,
+
+�pearl among women! She arrive, but I cannot stay. She must go to your
+
+house, friend John. You must meet her at the station. Telegraph her _en
+
+route_, so that she may be prepared.�
+
+When the wire was despatched he had a cup of tea; over it he told me of
+
+a diary kept by Jonathan Harker when abroad, and gave me a typewritten
+
+copy of it, as also of Mrs. Harker�s diary at Whitby. �Take these,� he
+
+said, �and study them well. When I have returned you will be master of
+
+all the facts, and we can then better enter on our inquisition. Keep
+
+them safe, for there is in them much of treasure. You will need all your
+
+faith, even you who have had such an experience as that of to-day. What
+
+is here told,� he laid his hand heavily and gravely on the packet of
+
+papers as he spoke, �may be the beginning of the end to you and me and
+
+many another; or it may sound the knell of the Un-Dead who walk the
+
+earth. Read all, I pray you, with the open mind; and if you can add in
+
+any way to the story here told do so, for it is all-important. You have
+
+kept diary of all these so strange things; is it not so? Yes! Then we
+
+shall go through all these together when we meet.� He then made ready
+
+for his departure, and shortly after drove off to Liverpool Street. I
+
+took my way to Paddington, where I arrived about fifteen minutes before
+
+the train came in.
+
+The crowd melted away, after the bustling fashion common to arrival
+
+platforms; and I was beginning to feel uneasy, lest I might miss my
+
+guest, when a sweet-faced, dainty-looking girl stepped up to me, and,
+
+after a quick glance, said: �Dr. Seward, is it not?�
+
+�And you are Mrs. Harker!� I answered at once; whereupon she held out
+
+her hand.
+
+�I knew you from the description of poor dear Lucy; but----� She stopped
+
+suddenly, and a quick blush overspread her face.
+
+The blush that rose to my own cheeks somehow set us both at ease, for it
+
+was a tacit answer to her own. I got her luggage, which included a
+
+typewriter, and we took the Underground to Fenchurch Street, after I had
+
+sent a wire to my housekeeper to have a sitting-room and bedroom
+
+prepared at once for Mrs. Harker.
+
+In due time we arrived. She knew, of course, that the place was a
+
+lunatic asylum, but I could see that she was unable to repress a shudder
+
+when we entered.
+
+She told me that, if she might, she would come presently to my study, as
+
+she had much to say. So here I am finishing my entry in my phonograph
+
+diary whilst I await her. As yet I have not had the chance of looking at
+
+the papers which Van Helsing left with me, though they lie open before
+
+me. I must get her interested in something, so that I may have an
+
+opportunity of reading them. She does not know how precious time is, or
+
+what a task we have in hand. I must be careful not to frighten her. Here
+
+she is!
+
+_Mina Harker�s Journal._
+
+_29 September._--After I had tidied myself, I went down to Dr. Seward�s
+
+study. At the door I paused a moment, for I thought I heard him talking
+
+with some one. As, however, he had pressed me to be quick, I knocked at
+
+the door, and on his calling out, �Come in,� I entered.
+
+To my intense surprise, there was no one with him. He was quite alone,
+
+and on the table opposite him was what I knew at once from the
+
+description to be a phonograph. I had never seen one, and was much
+
+interested.
+
+�I hope I did not keep you waiting,� I said; �but I stayed at the door
+
+as I heard you talking, and thought there was some one with you.�
+
+�Oh,� he replied with a smile, �I was only entering my diary.�
+
+�Your diary?� I asked him in surprise.
+
+�Yes,� he answered. �I keep it in this.� As he spoke he laid his hand on
+
+the phonograph. I felt quite excited over it, and blurted out:--
+
+�Why, this beats even shorthand! May I hear it say something?�
+
+�Certainly,� he replied with alacrity, and stood up to put it in train
+
+for speaking. Then he paused, and a troubled look overspread his face.
+
+�The fact is,� he began awkwardly, �I only keep my diary in it; and as
+
+it is entirely--almost entirely--about my cases, it may be awkward--that
+
+is, I mean----� He stopped, and I tried to help him out of his
+
+embarrassment:--
+
+�You helped to attend dear Lucy at the end. Let me hear how she died;
+
+for all that I know of her, I shall be very grateful. She was very, very
+
+dear to me.�
+
+To my surprise, he answered, with a horrorstruck look in his face:--
+
+�Tell you of her death? Not for the wide world!�
+
+�Why not?� I asked, for some grave, terrible feeling was coming over me.
+
+Again he paused, and I could see that he was trying to invent an excuse.
+
+At length he stammered out:--
+
+�You see, I do not know how to pick out any particular part of the
+
+diary.� Even while he was speaking an idea dawned upon him, and he said
+
+with unconscious simplicity, in a different voice, and with the na�vet�
+
+of a child: �That�s quite true, upon my honour. Honest Indian!� I could
+
+not but smile, at which he grimaced. �I gave myself away that time!� he
+
+said. �But do you know that, although I have kept the diary for months
+
+past, it never once struck me how I was going to find any particular
+
+part of it in case I wanted to look it up?� By this time my mind was
+
+made up that the diary of a doctor who attended Lucy might have
+
+something to add to the sum of our knowledge of that terrible Being, and
+
+I said boldly:--
+
+�Then, Dr. Seward, you had better let me copy it out for you on my
+
+typewriter.� He grew to a positively deathly pallor as he said:--
+
+�No! no! no! For all the world, I wouldn�t let you know that terrible
+
+story!�
+
+Then it was terrible; my intuition was right! For a moment I thought,
+
+and as my eyes ranged the room, unconsciously looking for something or
+
+some opportunity to aid me, they lit on a great batch of typewriting on
+
+the table. His eyes caught the look in mine, and, without his thinking,
+
+followed their direction. As they saw the parcel he realised my meaning.
+
+�You do not know me,� I said. �When you have read those papers--my own
+
+diary and my husband�s also, which I have typed--you will know me
+
+better. I have not faltered in giving every thought of my own heart in
+
+this cause; but, of course, you do not know me--yet; and I must not
+
+expect you to trust me so far.�
+
+He is certainly a man of noble nature; poor dear Lucy was right about
+
+him. He stood up and opened a large drawer, in which were arranged in
+
+order a number of hollow cylinders of metal covered with dark wax, and
+
+said:--
+
+�You are quite right. I did not trust you because I did not know you.
+
+But I know you now; and let me say that I should have known you long
+
+ago. I know that Lucy told you of me; she told me of you too. May I make
+
+the only atonement in my power? Take the cylinders and hear them--the
+
+first half-dozen of them are personal to me, and they will not horrify
+
+you; then you will know me better. Dinner will by then be ready. In the
+
+meantime I shall read over some of these documents, and shall be better
+
+able to understand certain things.� He carried the phonograph himself up
+
+to my sitting-room and adjusted it for me. Now I shall learn something
+
+pleasant, I am sure; for it will tell me the other side of a true love
+
+episode of which I know one side already....
+
+_Dr. Seward�s Diary._
+
+_29 September._--I was so absorbed in that wonderful diary of Jonathan
+
+Harker and that other of his wife that I let the time run on without
+
+thinking. Mrs. Harker was not down when the maid came to announce
+
+dinner, so I said: �She is possibly tired; let dinner wait an hour,� and
+
+I went on with my work. I had just finished Mrs. Harker�s diary, when
+
+she came in. She looked sweetly pretty, but very sad, and her eyes were
+
+flushed with crying. This somehow moved me much. Of late I have had
+
+cause for tears, God knows! but the relief of them was denied me; and
+
+now the sight of those sweet eyes, brightened with recent tears, went
+
+straight to my heart. So I said as gently as I could:--
+
+�I greatly fear I have distressed you.�
+
+�Oh, no, not distressed me,� she replied, �but I have been more touched
+
+than I can say by your grief. That is a wonderful machine, but it is
+
+cruelly true. It told me, in its very tones, the anguish of your heart.
+
+It was like a soul crying out to Almighty God. No one must hear them
+
+spoken ever again! See, I have tried to be useful. I have copied out the
+
+words on my typewriter, and none other need now hear your heart beat, as
+
+I did.�
+
+�No one need ever know, shall ever know,� I said in a low voice. She
+
+laid her hand on mine and said very gravely:--
+
+�Ah, but they must!�
+
+�Must! But why?� I asked.
+
+�Because it is a part of the terrible story, a part of poor dear Lucy�s
+
+death and all that led to it; because in the struggle which we have
+
+before us to rid the earth of this terrible monster we must have all
+
+the knowledge and all the help which we can get. I think that the
+
+cylinders which you gave me contained more than you intended me to know;
+
+but I can see that there are in your record many lights to this dark
+
+mystery. You will let me help, will you not? I know all up to a certain
+
+point; and I see already, though your diary only took me to 7 September,
+
+how poor Lucy was beset, and how her terrible doom was being wrought
+
+out. Jonathan and I have been working day and night since Professor Van
+
+Helsing saw us. He is gone to Whitby to get more information, and he
+
+will be here to-morrow to help us. We need have no secrets amongst us;
+
+working together and with absolute trust, we can surely be stronger than
+
+if some of us were in the dark.� She looked at me so appealingly, and at
+
+the same time manifested such courage and resolution in her bearing,
+
+that I gave in at once to her wishes. �You shall,� I said, �do as you
+
+like in the matter. God forgive me if I do wrong! There are terrible
+
+things yet to learn of; but if you have so far travelled on the road to
+
+poor Lucy�s death, you will not be content, I know, to remain in the
+
+dark. Nay, the end--the very end--may give you a gleam of peace. Come,
+
+there is dinner. We must keep one another strong for what is before us;
+
+we have a cruel and dreadful task. When you have eaten you shall learn
+
+the rest, and I shall answer any questions you ask--if there be anything
+
+which you do not understand, though it was apparent to us who were
+
+present.�
+
+_Mina Harker�s Journal._
+
+_29 September._--After dinner I came with Dr. Seward to his study. He
+
+brought back the phonograph from my room, and I took my typewriter. He
+
+placed me in a comfortable chair, and arranged the phonograph so that I
+
+could touch it without getting up, and showed me how to stop it in case
+
+I should want to pause. Then he very thoughtfully took a chair, with his
+
+back to me, so that I might be as free as possible, and began to read. I
+
+put the forked metal to my ears and listened.
+
+When the terrible story of Lucy�s death, and--and all that followed, was
+
+done, I lay back in my chair powerless. Fortunately I am not of a
+
+fainting disposition. When Dr. Seward saw me he jumped up with a
+
+horrified exclamation, and hurriedly taking a case-bottle from a
+
+cupboard, gave me some brandy, which in a few minutes somewhat restored
+
+me. My brain was all in a whirl, and only that there came through all
+
+the multitude of horrors, the holy ray of light that my dear, dear Lucy
+
+was at last at peace, I do not think I could have borne it without
+
+making a scene. It is all so wild, and mysterious, and strange that if I
+
+had not known Jonathan�s experience in Transylvania I could not have
+
+believed. As it was, I didn�t know what to believe, and so got out of my
+
+difficulty by attending to something else. I took the cover off my
+
+typewriter, and said to Dr. Seward:--
+
+�Let me write this all out now. We must be ready for Dr. Van Helsing
+
+when he comes. I have sent a telegram to Jonathan to come on here when
+
+he arrives in London from Whitby. In this matter dates are everything,
+
+and I think that if we get all our material ready, and have every item
+
+put in chronological order, we shall have done much. You tell me that
+
+Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris are coming too. Let us be able to tell him
+
+when they come.� He accordingly set the phonograph at a slow pace, and I
+
+began to typewrite from the beginning of the seventh cylinder. I used
+
+manifold, and so took three copies of the diary, just as I had done with
+
+all the rest. It was late when I got through, but Dr. Seward went about
+
+his work of going his round of the patients; when he had finished he
+
+came back and sat near me, reading, so that I did not feel too lonely
+
+whilst I worked. How good and thoughtful he is; the world seems full of
+
+good men--even if there _are_ monsters in it. Before I left him I
+
+remembered what Jonathan put in his diary of the Professor�s
+
+perturbation at reading something in an evening paper at the station at
+
+Exeter; so, seeing that Dr. Seward keeps his newspapers, I borrowed the
+
+files of �The Westminster Gazette� and �The Pall Mall Gazette,� and took
+
+them to my room. I remember how much �The Dailygraph� and �The Whitby
+
+Gazette,� of which I had made cuttings, helped us to understand the
+
+terrible events at Whitby when Count Dracula landed, so I shall look
+
+through the evening papers since then, and perhaps I shall get some new
+
+light. I am not sleepy, and the work will help to keep me quiet.
+
+_Dr. Seward�s Diary._
+
+_30 September._--Mr. Harker arrived at nine o�clock. He had got his
+
+wife�s wire just before starting. He is uncommonly clever, if one can
+
+judge from his face, and full of energy. If this journal be true--and
+
+judging by one�s own wonderful experiences, it must be--he is also a man
+
+of great nerve. That going down to the vault a second time was a
+
+remarkable piece of daring. After reading his account of it I was
+
+prepared to meet a good specimen of manhood, but hardly the quiet,
+
+business-like gentleman who came here to-day.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_Later._--After lunch Harker and his wife went back to their own room,
+
+and as I passed a while ago I heard the click of the typewriter. They
+
+are hard at it. Mrs. Harker says that they are knitting together in
+
+chronological order every scrap of evidence they have. Harker has got
+
+the letters between the consignee of the boxes at Whitby and the
+
+carriers in London who took charge of them. He is now reading his wife�s
+
+typescript of my diary. I wonder what they make out of it. Here it
+
+is....
+
+Strange that it never struck me that the very next house might be
+
+the Count�s hiding-place! Goodness knows that we had enough clues
+
+from the conduct of the patient Renfield! The bundle of letters
+
+relating to the purchase of the house were with the typescript. Oh,
+
+if we had only had them earlier we might have saved poor Lucy!
+
+Stop; that way madness lies! Harker has gone back, and is again
+
+collating his material. He says that by dinner-time they will be
+
+able to show a whole connected narrative. He thinks that in the
+
+meantime I should see Renfield, as hitherto he has been a sort of
+
+index to the coming and going of the Count. I hardly see this yet,
+
+but when I get at the dates I suppose I shall. What a good thing
+
+that Mrs. Harker put my cylinders into type! We never could have
+
+found the dates otherwise....
+
+I found Renfield sitting placidly in his room with his hands
+
+folded, smiling benignly. At the moment he seemed as sane as any
+
+one I ever saw. I sat down and talked with him on a lot of
+
+subjects, all of which he treated naturally. He then, of his own
+
+accord, spoke of going home, a subject he has never mentioned to my
+
+knowledge during his sojourn here. In fact, he spoke quite
+
+confidently of getting his discharge at once. I believe that, had I
+
+not had the chat with Harker and read the letters and the dates of
+
+his outbursts, I should have been prepared to sign for him after a
+
+brief time of observation. As it is, I am darkly suspicious. All
+
+those outbreaks were in some way linked with the proximity of the
+
+Count. What then does this absolute content mean? Can it be that
+
+his instinct is satisfied as to the vampire�s ultimate triumph?
+
+Stay; he is himself zo�phagous, and in his wild ravings outside the
+
+chapel door of the deserted house he always spoke of �master.� This
+
+all seems confirmation of our idea. However, after a while I came
+
+away; my friend is just a little too sane at present to make it
+
+safe to probe him too deep with questions. He might begin to think,
+
+and then--! So I came away. I mistrust these quiet moods of his; so
+
+I have given the attendant a hint to look closely after him, and to
+
+have a strait-waistcoat ready in case of need.
+
+_Jonathan Harker�s Journal._
+
+_29 September, in train to London._--When I received Mr. Billington�s
+
+courteous message that he would give me any information in his power I
+
+thought it best to go down to Whitby and make, on the spot, such
+
+inquiries as I wanted. It was now my object to trace that horrid cargo
+
+of the Count�s to its place in London. Later, we may be able to deal
+
+with it. Billington junior, a nice lad, met me at the station, and
+
+brought me to his father�s house, where they had decided that I must
+
+stay the night. They are hospitable, with true Yorkshire hospitality:
+
+give a guest everything, and leave him free to do as he likes. They all
+
+knew that I was busy, and that my stay was short, and Mr. Billington had
+
+ready in his office all the papers concerning the consignment of boxes.
+
+It gave me almost a turn to see again one of the letters which I had
+
+seen on the Count�s table before I knew of his diabolical plans.
+
+Everything had been carefully thought out, and done systematically and
+
+with precision. He seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle which
+
+might be placed by accident in the way of his intentions being carried
+
+out. To use an Americanism, he had �taken no chances,� and the absolute
+
+accuracy with which his instructions were fulfilled, was simply the
+
+logical result of his care. I saw the invoice, and took note of it:
+
+�Fifty cases of common earth, to be used for experimental purposes.�
+
+Also the copy of letter to Carter Paterson, and their reply; of both of
+
+these I got copies. This was all the information Mr. Billington could
+
+give me, so I went down to the port and saw the coastguards, the Customs
+
+officers and the harbour-master. They had all something to say of the
+
+strange entry of the ship, which is already taking its place in local
+
+tradition; but no one could add to the simple description �Fifty cases
+
+of common earth.� I then saw the station-master, who kindly put me in
+
+communication with the men who had actually received the boxes. Their
+
+tally was exact with the list, and they had nothing to add except that
+
+the boxes were �main and mortal heavy,� and that shifting them was dry
+
+work. One of them added that it was hard lines that there wasn�t any
+
+gentleman �such-like as yourself, squire,� to show some sort of
+
+appreciation of their efforts in a liquid form; another put in a rider
+
+that the thirst then generated was such that even the time which had
+
+elapsed had not completely allayed it. Needless to add, I took care
+
+before leaving to lift, for ever and adequately, this source of
+
+reproach.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_30 September._--The station-master was good enough to give me a line to
+
+his old companion the station-master at King�s Cross, so that when I
+
+arrived there in the morning I was able to ask him about the arrival of
+
+the boxes. He, too, put me at once in communication with the proper
+
+officials, and I saw that their tally was correct with the original
+
+invoice. The opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had been here
+
+limited; a noble use of them had, however, been made, and again I was
+
+compelled to deal with the result in an _ex post facto_ manner.
+
+From thence I went on to Carter Paterson�s central office, where I met
+
+with the utmost courtesy. They looked up the transaction in their
+
+day-book and letter-book, and at once telephoned to their King�s Cross
+
+office for more details. By good fortune, the men who did the teaming
+
+were waiting for work, and the official at once sent them over, sending
+
+also by one of them the way-bill and all the papers connected with the
+
+delivery of the boxes at Carfax. Here again I found the tally agreeing
+
+exactly; the carriers� men were able to supplement the paucity of the
+
+written words with a few details. These were, I shortly found, connected
+
+almost solely with the dusty nature of the job, and of the consequent
+
+thirst engendered in the operators. On my affording an opportunity,
+
+through the medium of the currency of the realm, of the allaying, at a
+
+later period, this beneficial evil, one of the men remarked:--
+
+�That �ere �ouse, guv�nor, is the rummiest I ever was in. Blyme! but it
+
+ain�t been touched sence a hundred years. There was dust that thick in
+
+the place that you might have slep� on it without �urtin� of yer bones;
+
+an� the place was that neglected that yer might �ave smelled ole
+
+Jerusalem in it. But the ole chapel--that took the cike, that did! Me
+
+and my mate, we thort we wouldn�t never git out quick enough. Lor�, I
+
+wouldn�t take less nor a quid a moment to stay there arter dark.�
+
+Having been in the house, I could well believe him; but if he knew what
+
+I know, he would, I think, have raised his terms.
+
+Of one thing I am now satisfied: that _all_ the boxes which arrived at
+
+Whitby from Varna in the _Demeter_ were safely deposited in the old
+
+chapel at Carfax. There should be fifty of them there, unless any have
+
+since been removed--as from Dr. Seward�s diary I fear.
+
+I shall try to see the carter who took away the boxes from Carfax when
+
+Renfield attacked them. By following up this clue we may learn a good
+
+deal.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_Later._--Mina and I have worked all day, and we have put all the papers
+
+into order.
+
+_Mina Harker�s Journal_
+
+_30 September._--I am so glad that I hardly know how to contain myself.
+
+It is, I suppose, the reaction from the haunting fear which I have had:
+
+that this terrible affair and the reopening of his old wound might act
+
+detrimentally on Jonathan. I saw him leave for Whitby with as brave a
+
+face as I could, but I was sick with apprehension. The effort has,
+
+however, done him good. He was never so resolute, never so strong, never
+
+so full of volcanic energy, as at present. It is just as that dear, good
+
+Professor Van Helsing said: he is true grit, and he improves under
+
+strain that would kill a weaker nature. He came back full of life and
+
+hope and determination; we have got everything in order for to-night. I
+
+feel myself quite wild with excitement. I suppose one ought to pity any
+
+thing so hunted as is the Count. That is just it: this Thing is not
+
+human--not even beast. To read Dr. Seward�s account of poor Lucy�s
+
+death, and what followed, is enough to dry up the springs of pity in
+
+one�s heart.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_Later._--Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris arrived earlier than we
+
+expected. Dr. Seward was out on business, and had taken Jonathan with
+
+him, so I had to see them. It was to me a painful meeting, for it
+
+brought back all poor dear Lucy�s hopes of only a few months ago. Of
+
+course they had heard Lucy speak of me, and it seemed that Dr. Van
+
+Helsing, too, has been quite �blowing my trumpet,� as Mr. Morris
+
+expressed it. Poor fellows, neither of them is aware that I know all
+
+about the proposals they made to Lucy. They did not quite know what to
+
+say or do, as they were ignorant of the amount of my knowledge; so they
+
+had to keep on neutral subjects. However, I thought the matter over, and
+
+came to the conclusion that the best thing I could do would be to post
+
+them in affairs right up to date. I knew from Dr. Seward�s diary that
+
+they had been at Lucy�s death--her real death--and that I need not fear
+
+to betray any secret before the time. So I told them, as well as I
+
+could, that I had read all the papers and diaries, and that my husband
+
+and I, having typewritten them, had just finished putting them in order.
+
+I gave them each a copy to read in the library. When Lord Godalming got
+
+his and turned it over--it does make a pretty good pile--he said:--
+
+�Did you write all this, Mrs. Harker?�
+
+I nodded, and he went on:--
+
+�I don�t quite see the drift of it; but you people are all so good and
+
+kind, and have been working so earnestly and so energetically, that all
+
+I can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you. I have
+
+had one lesson already in accepting facts that should make a man humble
+
+to the last hour of his life. Besides, I know you loved my poor Lucy--�
+
+Here he turned away and covered his face with his hands. I could hear
+
+the tears in his voice. Mr. Morris, with instinctive delicacy, just laid
+
+a hand for a moment on his shoulder, and then walked quietly out of the
+
+room. I suppose there is something in woman�s nature that makes a man
+
+free to break down before her and express his feelings on the tender or
+
+emotional side without feeling it derogatory to his manhood; for when
+
+Lord Godalming found himself alone with me he sat down on the sofa and
+
+gave way utterly and openly. I sat down beside him and took his hand. I
+
+hope he didn�t think it forward of me, and that if he ever thinks of it
+
+afterwards he never will have such a thought. There I wrong him; I
+
+_know_ he never will--he is too true a gentleman. I said to him, for I
+
+could see that his heart was breaking:--
+
+�I loved dear Lucy, and I know what she was to you, and what you were to
+
+her. She and I were like sisters; and now she is gone, will you not let
+
+me be like a sister to you in your trouble? I know what sorrows you have
+
+had, though I cannot measure the depth of them. If sympathy and pity can
+
+help in your affliction, won�t you let me be of some little service--for
+
+Lucy�s sake?�
+
+In an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief. It seemed
+
+to me that all that he had of late been suffering in silence found a
+
+vent at once. He grew quite hysterical, and raising his open hands, beat
+
+his palms together in a perfect agony of grief. He stood up and then sat
+
+down again, and the tears rained down his cheeks. I felt an infinite
+
+pity for him, and opened my arms unthinkingly. With a sob he laid his
+
+head on my shoulder and cried like a wearied child, whilst he shook with
+
+emotion.
+
+We women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise above
+
+smaller matters when the mother-spirit is invoked; I felt this big
+
+sorrowing man�s head resting on me, as though it were that of the baby
+
+that some day may lie on my bosom, and I stroked his hair as though he
+
+were my own child. I never thought at the time how strange it all was.
+
+After a little bit his sobs ceased, and he raised himself with an
+
+apology, though he made no disguise of his emotion. He told me that for
+
+days and nights past--weary days and sleepless nights--he had been
+
+unable to speak with any one, as a man must speak in his time of
+
+sorrow. There was no woman whose sympathy could be given to him, or with
+
+whom, owing to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow was
+
+surrounded, he could speak freely. �I know now how I suffered,� he said,
+
+as he dried his eyes, �but I do not know even yet--and none other can
+
+ever know--how much your sweet sympathy has been to me to-day. I shall
+
+know better in time; and believe me that, though I am not ungrateful
+
+now, my gratitude will grow with my understanding. You will let me be
+
+like a brother, will you not, for all our lives--for dear Lucy�s sake?�
+
+�For dear Lucy�s sake,� I said as we clasped hands. �Ay, and for your
+
+own sake,� he added, �for if a man�s esteem and gratitude are ever worth
+
+the winning, you have won mine to-day. If ever the future should bring
+
+to you a time when you need a man�s help, believe me, you will not call
+
+in vain. God grant that no such time may ever come to you to break the
+
+sunshine of your life; but if it should ever come, promise me that you
+
+will let me know.� He was so earnest, and his sorrow was so fresh, that
+
+I felt it would comfort him, so I said:--
+
+�I promise.�
+
+As I came along the corridor I saw Mr. Morris looking out of a window.
+
+He turned as he heard my footsteps. �How is Art?� he said. Then noticing
+
+my red eyes, he went on: �Ah, I see you have been comforting him. Poor
+
+old fellow! he needs it. No one but a woman can help a man when he is in
+
+trouble of the heart; and he had no one to comfort him.�
+
+He bore his own trouble so bravely that my heart bled for him. I saw the
+
+manuscript in his hand, and I knew that when he read it he would realise
+
+how much I knew; so I said to him:--
+
+�I wish I could comfort all who suffer from the heart. Will you let me
+
+be your friend, and will you come to me for comfort if you need it? You
+
+will know, later on, why I speak.� He saw that I was in earnest, and
+
+stooping, took my hand, and raising it to his lips, kissed it. It seemed
+
+but poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul, and impulsively I
+
+bent over and kissed him. The tears rose in his eyes, and there was a
+
+momentary choking in his throat; he said quite calmly:--
+
+�Little girl, you will never regret that true-hearted kindness, so long
+
+as ever you live!� Then he went into the study to his friend.
+
+�Little girl!�--the very words he had used to Lucy, and oh, but he
+
+proved himself a friend!

+CHAPTER XX
+
+JONATHAN HARKER�S JOURNAL
+
+_1 October, evening._--I found Thomas Snelling in his house at Bethnal
+
+Green, but unhappily he was not in a condition to remember anything. The
+
+very prospect of beer which my expected coming had opened to him had
+
+proved too much, and he had begun too early on his expected debauch. I
+
+learned, however, from his wife, who seemed a decent, poor soul, that he
+
+was only the assistant to Smollet, who of the two mates was the
+
+responsible person. So off I drove to Walworth, and found Mr. Joseph
+
+Smollet at home and in his shirtsleeves, taking a late tea out of a
+
+saucer. He is a decent, intelligent fellow, distinctly a good, reliable
+
+type of workman, and with a headpiece of his own. He remembered all
+
+about the incident of the boxes, and from a wonderful dog�s-eared
+
+notebook, which he produced from some mysterious receptacle about the
+
+seat of his trousers, and which had hieroglyphical entries in thick,
+
+half-obliterated pencil, he gave me the destinations of the boxes. There
+
+were, he said, six in the cartload which he took from Carfax and left at
+
+197, Chicksand Street, Mile End New Town, and another six which he
+
+deposited at Jamaica Lane, Bermondsey. If then the Count meant to
+
+scatter these ghastly refuges of his over London, these places were
+
+chosen as the first of delivery, so that later he might distribute more
+
+fully. The systematic manner in which this was done made me think that
+
+he could not mean to confine himself to two sides of London. He was now
+
+fixed on the far east of the northern shore, on the east of the southern
+
+shore, and on the south. The north and west were surely never meant to
+
+be left out of his diabolical scheme--let alone the City itself and the
+
+very heart of fashionable London in the south-west and west. I went back
+
+to Smollet, and asked him if he could tell us if any other boxes had
+
+been taken from Carfax.
+
+He replied:--
+
+�Well, guv�nor, you�ve treated me wery �an�some�--I had given him half a
+
+sovereign--�an� I�ll tell yer all I know. I heard a man by the name of
+
+Bloxam say four nights ago in the �Are an� �Ounds, in Pincher�s Alley,
+
+as �ow he an� his mate �ad �ad a rare dusty job in a old �ouse at
+
+Purfect. There ain�t a-many such jobs as this �ere, an� I�m thinkin�
+
+that maybe Sam Bloxam could tell ye summut.� I asked if he could tell me
+
+where to find him. I told him that if he could get me the address it
+
+would be worth another half-sovereign to him. So he gulped down the rest
+
+of his tea and stood up, saying that he was going to begin the search
+
+then and there. At the door he stopped, and said:--
+
+�Look �ere, guv�nor, there ain�t no sense in me a-keepin� you �ere. I
+
+may find Sam soon, or I mayn�t; but anyhow he ain�t like to be in a way
+
+to tell ye much to-night. Sam is a rare one when he starts on the booze.
+
+If you can give me a envelope with a stamp on it, and put yer address on
+
+it, I�ll find out where Sam is to be found and post it ye to-night. But
+
+ye�d better be up arter �im soon in the mornin�, or maybe ye won�t ketch
+
+�im; for Sam gets off main early, never mind the booze the night afore.�
+
+This was all practical, so one of the children went off with a penny to
+
+buy an envelope and a sheet of paper, and to keep the change. When she
+
+came back, I addressed the envelope and stamped it, and when Smollet had
+
+again faithfully promised to post the address when found, I took my way
+
+to home. We�re on the track anyhow. I am tired to-night, and want sleep.
+
+Mina is fast asleep, and looks a little too pale; her eyes look as
+
+though she had been crying. Poor dear, I�ve no doubt it frets her to be
+
+kept in the dark, and it may make her doubly anxious about me and the
+
+others. But it is best as it is. It is better to be disappointed and
+
+worried in such a way now than to have her nerve broken. The doctors
+
+were quite right to insist on her being kept out of this dreadful
+
+business. I must be firm, for on me this particular burden of silence
+
+must rest. I shall not ever enter on the subject with her under any
+
+circumstances. Indeed, it may not be a hard task, after all, for she
+
+herself has become reticent on the subject, and has not spoken of the
+
+Count or his doings ever since we told her of our decision.

+
+_2 October, evening._--A long and trying and exciting day. By the first
+
+post I got my directed envelope with a dirty scrap of paper enclosed, on
+
+which was written with a carpenter�s pencil in a sprawling hand:--
+
+�Sam Bloxam, Korkrans, 4, Poters Cort, Bartel Street, Walworth. Arsk for
+
+the depite.�
+
+I got the letter in bed, and rose without waking Mina. She looked heavy
+
+and sleepy and pale, and far from well. I determined not to wake her,
+
+but that, when I should return from this new search, I would arrange for
+
+her going back to Exeter. I think she would be happier in our own home,
+
+with her daily tasks to interest her, than in being here amongst us and
+
+in ignorance. I only saw Dr. Seward for a moment, and told him where I
+
+was off to, promising to come back and tell the rest so soon as I should
+
+have found out anything. I drove to Walworth and found, with some
+
+difficulty, Potter�s Court. Mr. Smollet�s spelling misled me, as I asked
+
+for Poter�s Court instead of Potter�s Court. However, when I had found
+
+the court, I had no difficulty in discovering Corcoran�s lodging-house.
+
+When I asked the man who came to the door for the �depite,� he shook his
+
+head, and said: �I dunno �im. There ain�t no such a person �ere; I never
+
+�eard of �im in all my bloomin� days. Don�t believe there ain�t nobody
+
+of that kind livin� ere or anywheres.� I took out Smollet�s letter, and
+
+as I read it it seemed to me that the lesson of the spelling of the name
+
+of the court might guide me. �What are you?� I asked.
+
+�I�m the depity,� he answered. I saw at once that I was on the right
+
+track; phonetic spelling had again misled me. A half-crown tip put the
+
+deputy�s knowledge at my disposal, and I learned that Mr. Bloxam, who
+
+had slept off the remains of his beer on the previous night at
+
+Corcoran�s, had left for his work at Poplar at five o�clock that
+
+morning. He could not tell me where the place of work was situated, but
+
+he had a vague idea that it was some kind of a �new-fangled ware�us�;
+
+and with this slender clue I had to start for Poplar. It was twelve
+
+o�clock before I got any satisfactory hint of such a building, and this
+
+I got at a coffee-shop, where some workmen were having their dinner. One
+
+of these suggested that there was being erected at Cross Angel Street a
+
+new �cold storage� building; and as this suited the condition of a
+
+�new-fangled ware�us,� I at once drove to it. An interview with a surly
+
+gatekeeper and a surlier foreman, both of whom were appeased with the
+
+coin of the realm, put me on the track of Bloxam; he was sent for on my
+
+suggesting that I was willing to pay his day�s wages to his foreman for
+
+the privilege of asking him a few questions on a private matter. He was
+
+a smart enough fellow, though rough of speech and bearing. When I had
+
+promised to pay for his information and given him an earnest, he told me
+
+that he had made two journeys between Carfax and a house in Piccadilly,
+
+and had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxes--�main
+
+heavy ones�--with a horse and cart hired by him for this purpose. I
+
+asked him if he could tell me the number of the house in Piccadilly, to
+
+which he replied:--
+
+�Well, guv�nor, I forgits the number, but it was only a few doors from a
+
+big white church or somethink of the kind, not long built. It was a
+
+dusty old �ouse, too, though nothin� to the dustiness of the �ouse we
+
+tooked the bloomin� boxes from.�
+
+�How did you get into the houses if they were both empty?�
+
+�There was the old party what engaged me a-waitin� in the �ouse at
+
+Purfleet. He �elped me to lift the boxes and put them in the dray. Curse
+
+me, but he was the strongest chap I ever struck, an� him a old feller,
+
+with a white moustache, one that thin you would think he couldn�t throw
+
+a shadder.�
+
+How this phrase thrilled through me!
+
+�Why, �e took up �is end o� the boxes like they was pounds of tea, and
+
+me a-puffin� an� a-blowin� afore I could up-end mine anyhow--an� I�m no
+
+chicken, neither.�
+
+�How did you get into the house in Piccadilly?� I asked.
+
+�He was there too. He must �a� started off and got there afore me, for
+
+when I rung of the bell he kem an� opened the door �isself an� �elped me
+
+to carry the boxes into the �all.�
+
+�The whole nine?� I asked.
+
+�Yus; there was five in the first load an� four in the second. It was
+
+main dry work, an� I don�t so well remember �ow I got �ome.� I
+
+interrupted him:--
+
+�Were the boxes left in the hall?�
+
+�Yus; it was a big �all, an� there was nothin� else in it.� I made one
+
+more attempt to further matters:--
+
+�You didn�t have any key?�
+
+�Never used no key nor nothink. The old gent, he opened the door �isself
+
+an� shut it again when I druv off. I don�t remember the last time--but
+
+that was the beer.�
+
+�And you can�t remember the number of the house?�
+
+�No, sir. But ye needn�t have no difficulty about that. It�s a �igh �un
+
+with a stone front with a bow on it, an� �igh steps up to the door. I
+
+know them steps, �avin� �ad to carry the boxes up with three loafers
+
+what come round to earn a copper. The old gent give them shillin�s, an�
+
+they seein� they got so much, they wanted more; but �e took one of them
+
+by the shoulder and was like to throw �im down the steps, till the lot
+
+of them went away cussin�.� I thought that with this description I could
+
+find the house, so, having paid my friend for his information, I started
+
+off for Piccadilly. I had gained a new painful experience; the Count
+
+could, it was evident, handle the earth-boxes himself. If so, time was
+
+precious; for, now that he had achieved a certain amount of
+
+distribution, he could, by choosing his own time, complete the task
+
+unobserved. At Piccadilly Circus I discharged my cab, and walked
+
+westward; beyond the Junior Constitutional I came across the house
+
+described, and was satisfied that this was the next of the lairs
+
+arranged by Dracula. The house looked as though it had been long
+
+untenanted. The windows were encrusted with dust, and the shutters were
+
+up. All the framework was black with time, and from the iron the paint
+
+had mostly scaled away. It was evident that up to lately there had been
+
+a large notice-board in front of the balcony; it had, however, been
+
+roughly torn away, the uprights which had supported it still remaining.
+
+Behind the rails of the balcony I saw there were some loose boards,
+
+whose raw edges looked white. I would have given a good deal to have
+
+been able to see the notice-board intact, as it would, perhaps, have
+
+given some clue to the ownership of the house. I remembered my
+
+experience of the investigation and purchase of Carfax, and I could not
+
+but feel that if I could find the former owner there might be some means
+
+discovered of gaining access to the house.
+
+There was at present nothing to be learned from the Piccadilly side, and
+
+nothing could be done; so I went round to the back to see if anything
+
+could be gathered from this quarter. The mews were active, the
+
+Piccadilly houses being mostly in occupation. I asked one or two of the
+
+grooms and helpers whom I saw around if they could tell me anything
+
+about the empty house. One of them said that he heard it had lately been
+
+taken, but he couldn�t say from whom. He told me, however, that up to
+
+very lately there had been a notice-board of �For Sale� up, and that
+
+perhaps Mitchell, Sons, & Candy, the house agents, could tell me
+
+something, as he thought he remembered seeing the name of that firm on
+
+the board. I did not wish to seem too eager, or to let my informant know
+
+or guess too much, so, thanking him in the usual manner, I strolled
+
+away. It was now growing dusk, and the autumn night was closing in, so I
+
+did not lose any time. Having learned the address of Mitchell, Sons, &
+
+Candy from a directory at the Berkeley, I was soon at their office in
+
+Sackville Street.
+
+The gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in manner, but
+
+uncommunicative in equal proportion. Having once told me that the
+
+Piccadilly house--which throughout our interview he called a
+
+�mansion�--was sold, he considered my business as concluded. When I
+
+asked who had purchased it, he opened his eyes a thought wider, and
+
+paused a few seconds before replying:--
+
+�It is sold, sir.�
+
+�Pardon me,� I said, with equal politeness, �but I have a special reason
+
+for wishing to know who purchased it.�
+
+Again he paused longer, and raised his eyebrows still more. �It is sold,
+
+sir,� was again his laconic reply.
+
+�Surely,� I said, �you do not mind letting me know so much.�
+
+�But I do mind,� he answered. �The affairs of their clients are
+
+absolutely safe in the hands of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy.� This was
+
+manifestly a prig of the first water, and there was no use arguing with
+
+him. I thought I had best meet him on his own ground, so I said:--
+
+�Your clients, sir, are happy in having so resolute a guardian of their
+
+confidence. I am myself a professional man.� Here I handed him my card.
+
+�In this instance I am not prompted by curiosity; I act on the part of
+
+Lord Godalming, who wishes to know something of the property which was,
+
+he understood, lately for sale.� These words put a different complexion
+
+on affairs. He said:--
+
+�I would like to oblige you if I could, Mr. Harker, and especially would
+
+I like to oblige his lordship. We once carried out a small matter of
+
+renting some chambers for him when he was the Honourable Arthur
+
+Holmwood. If you will let me have his lordship�s address I will consult
+
+the House on the subject, and will, in any case, communicate with his
+
+lordship by to-night�s post. It will be a pleasure if we can so far
+
+deviate from our rules as to give the required information to his
+
+lordship.�
+
+I wanted to secure a friend, and not to make an enemy, so I thanked him,
+
+gave the address at Dr. Seward�s and came away. It was now dark, and I
+
+was tired and hungry. I got a cup of tea at the A�rated Bread Company
+
+and came down to Purfleet by the next train.
+
+I found all the others at home. Mina was looking tired and pale, but she
+
+made a gallant effort to be bright and cheerful, it wrung my heart to
+
+think that I had had to keep anything from her and so caused her
+
+inquietude. Thank God, this will be the last night of her looking on at
+
+our conferences, and feeling the sting of our not showing our
+
+confidence. It took all my courage to hold to the wise resolution of
+
+keeping her out of our grim task. She seems somehow more reconciled; or
+
+else the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her, for when
+
+any accidental allusion is made she actually shudders. I am glad we
+
+made our resolution in time, as with such a feeling as this, our growing
+
+knowledge would be torture to her.
+
+I could not tell the others of the day�s discovery till we were alone;
+
+so after dinner--followed by a little music to save appearances even
+
+amongst ourselves--I took Mina to her room and left her to go to bed.
+
+The dear girl was more affectionate with me than ever, and clung to me
+
+as though she would detain me; but there was much to be talked of and I
+
+came away. Thank God, the ceasing of telling things has made no
+
+difference between us.
+
+When I came down again I found the others all gathered round the fire in
+
+the study. In the train I had written my diary so far, and simply read
+
+it off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of my own
+
+information; when I had finished Van Helsing said:--
+
+�This has been a great day�s work, friend Jonathan. Doubtless we are on
+
+the track of the missing boxes. If we find them all in that house, then
+
+our work is near the end. But if there be some missing, we must search
+
+until we find them. Then shall we make our final _coup_, and hunt the
+
+wretch to his real death.� We all sat silent awhile and all at once Mr.
+
+Morris spoke:--
+
+�Say! how are we going to get into that house?�
+
+�We got into the other,� answered Lord Godalming quickly.
+
+�But, Art, this is different. We broke house at Carfax, but we had night
+
+and a walled park to protect us. It will be a mighty different thing to
+
+commit burglary in Piccadilly, either by day or night. I confess I don�t
+
+see how we are going to get in unless that agency duck can find us a key
+
+of some sort; perhaps we shall know when you get his letter in the
+
+morning.� Lord Godalming�s brows contracted, and he stood up and walked
+
+about the room. By-and-by he stopped and said, turning from one to
+
+another of us:--
+
+�Quincey�s head is level. This burglary business is getting serious; we
+
+got off once all right; but we have now a rare job on hand--unless we
+
+can find the Count�s key basket.�
+
+As nothing could well be done before morning, and as it would be at
+
+least advisable to wait till Lord Godalming should hear from Mitchell�s,
+
+we decided not to take any active step before breakfast time. For a good
+
+while we sat and smoked, discussing the matter in its various lights and
+
+bearings; I took the opportunity of bringing this diary right up to the
+
+moment. I am very sleepy and shall go to bed....
+
+Just a line. Mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is regular. Her
+
+forehead is puckered up into little wrinkles, as though she thinks even
+
+in her sleep. She is still too pale, but does not look so haggard as she
+
+did this morning. To-morrow will, I hope, mend all this; she will be
+
+herself at home in Exeter. Oh, but I am sleepy!
+
+_Dr. Seward�s Diary._
+
+_1 October._--I am puzzled afresh about Renfield. His moods change so
+
+rapidly that I find it difficult to keep touch of them, and as they
+
+always mean something more than his own well-being, they form a more
+
+than interesting study. This morning, when I went to see him after his
+
+repulse of Van Helsing, his manner was that of a man commanding destiny.
+
+He was, in fact, commanding destiny--subjectively. He did not really
+
+care for any of the things of mere earth; he was in the clouds and
+
+looked down on all the weaknesses and wants of us poor mortals. I
+
+thought I would improve the occasion and learn something, so I asked
+
+him:--
+
+�What about the flies these times?� He smiled on me in quite a superior
+
+sort of way--such a smile as would have become the face of Malvolio--as
+
+he answered me:--
+
+�The fly, my dear sir, has one striking feature; its wings are typical
+
+of the a�rial powers of the psychic faculties. The ancients did well
+
+when they typified the soul as a butterfly!�
+
+I thought I would push his analogy to its utmost logically, so I said
+
+quickly:--
+
+�Oh, it is a soul you are after now, is it?� His madness foiled his
+
+reason, and a puzzled look spread over his face as, shaking his head
+
+with a decision which I had but seldom seen in him, he said:--
+
+�Oh, no, oh no! I want no souls. Life is all I want.� Here he brightened
+
+up; �I am pretty indifferent about it at present. Life is all right; I
+
+have all I want. You must get a new patient, doctor, if you wish to
+
+study zo�phagy!�
+
+This puzzled me a little, so I drew him on:--
+
+�Then you command life; you are a god, I suppose?� He smiled with an
+
+ineffably benign superiority.
+
+�Oh no! Far be it from me to arrogate to myself the attributes of the
+
+Deity. I am not even concerned in His especially spiritual doings. If I
+
+may state my intellectual position I am, so far as concerns things
+
+purely terrestrial, somewhat in the position which Enoch occupied
+
+spiritually!� This was a poser to me. I could not at the moment recall
+
+Enoch�s appositeness; so I had to ask a simple question, though I felt
+
+that by so doing I was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic:--
+
+�And why with Enoch?�
+
+�Because he walked with God.� I could not see the analogy, but did not
+
+like to admit it; so I harked back to what he had denied:--
+
+�So you don�t care about life and you don�t want souls. Why not?� I put
+
+my question quickly and somewhat sternly, on purpose to disconcert him.
+
+The effort succeeded; for an instant he unconsciously relapsed into his
+
+old servile manner, bent low before me, and actually fawned upon me as
+
+he replied:--
+
+�I don�t want any souls, indeed, indeed! I don�t. I couldn�t use them if
+
+I had them; they would be no manner of use to me. I couldn�t eat them
+
+or----� He suddenly stopped and the old cunning look spread over his
+
+face, like a wind-sweep on the surface of the water. �And doctor, as to
+
+life, what is it after all? When you�ve got all you require, and you
+
+know that you will never want, that is all. I have friends--good
+
+friends--like you, Dr. Seward�; this was said with a leer of
+
+inexpressible cunning. �I know that I shall never lack the means of
+
+life!�
+
+I think that through the cloudiness of his insanity he saw some
+
+antagonism in me, for he at once fell back on the last refuge of such as
+
+he--a dogged silence. After a short time I saw that for the present it
+
+was useless to speak to him. He was sulky, and so I came away.
+
+Later in the day he sent for me. Ordinarily I would not have come
+
+without special reason, but just at present I am so interested in him
+
+that I would gladly make an effort. Besides, I am glad to have anything
+
+to help to pass the time. Harker is out, following up clues; and so are
+
+Lord Godalming and Quincey. Van Helsing sits in my study poring over the
+
+record prepared by the Harkers; he seems to think that by accurate
+
+knowledge of all details he will light upon some clue. He does not wish
+
+to be disturbed in the work, without cause. I would have taken him with
+
+me to see the patient, only I thought that after his last repulse he
+
+might not care to go again. There was also another reason: Renfield
+
+might not speak so freely before a third person as when he and I were
+
+alone.
+
+I found him sitting out in the middle of the floor on his stool, a pose
+
+which is generally indicative of some mental energy on his part. When I
+
+came in, he said at once, as though the question had been waiting on his
+
+lips:--
+
+�What about souls?� It was evident then that my surmise had been
+
+correct. Unconscious cerebration was doing its work, even with the
+
+lunatic. I determined to have the matter out. �What about them
+
+yourself?� I asked. He did not reply for a moment but looked all round
+
+him, and up and down, as though he expected to find some inspiration for
+
+an answer.
+
+�I don�t want any souls!� he said in a feeble, apologetic way. The
+
+matter seemed preying on his mind, and so I determined to use it--to �be
+
+cruel only to be kind.� So I said:--
+
+�You like life, and you want life?�
+
+�Oh yes! but that is all right; you needn�t worry about that!�
+
+�But,� I asked, �how are we to get the life without getting the soul
+
+also?� This seemed to puzzle him, so I followed it up:--
+
+�A nice time you�ll have some time when you�re flying out there, with
+
+the souls of thousands of flies and spiders and birds and cats buzzing
+
+and twittering and miauing all round you. You�ve got their lives, you
+
+know, and you must put up with their souls!� Something seemed to affect
+
+his imagination, for he put his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes,
+
+screwing them up tightly just as a small boy does when his face is being
+
+soaped. There was something pathetic in it that touched me; it also gave
+
+me a lesson, for it seemed that before me was a child--only a child,
+
+though the features were worn, and the stubble on the jaws was white. It
+
+was evident that he was undergoing some process of mental disturbance,
+
+and, knowing how his past moods had interpreted things seemingly foreign
+
+to himself, I thought I would enter into his mind as well as I could and
+
+go with him. The first step was to restore confidence, so I asked him,
+
+speaking pretty loud so that he would hear me through his closed ears:--
+
+�Would you like some sugar to get your flies round again?� He seemed to
+
+wake up all at once, and shook his head. With a laugh he replied:--
+
+�Not much! flies are poor things, after all!� After a pause he added,
+
+�But I don�t want their souls buzzing round me, all the same.�
+
+�Or spiders?� I went on.
+
+�Blow spiders! What�s the use of spiders? There isn�t anything in them
+
+to eat or�--he stopped suddenly, as though reminded of a forbidden
+
+topic.
+
+�So, so!� I thought to myself, �this is the second time he has suddenly
+
+stopped at the word �drink�; what does it mean?� Renfield seemed himself
+
+aware of having made a lapse, for he hurried on, as though to distract
+
+my attention from it:--
+
+�I don�t take any stock at all in such matters. �Rats and mice and such
+
+small deer,� as Shakespeare has it, �chicken-feed of the larder� they
+
+might be called. I�m past all that sort of nonsense. You might as well
+
+ask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chop-sticks, as to try to
+
+interest me about the lesser carnivora, when I know of what is before
+
+me.�
+
+�I see,� I said. �You want big things that you can make your teeth meet
+
+in? How would you like to breakfast on elephant?�
+
+�What ridiculous nonsense you are talking!� He was getting too wide
+
+awake, so I thought I would press him hard. �I wonder,� I said
+
+reflectively, �what an elephant�s soul is like!�
+
+The effect I desired was obtained, for he at once fell from his
+
+high-horse and became a child again.
+
+�I don�t want an elephant�s soul, or any soul at all!� he said. For a
+
+few moments he sat despondently. Suddenly he jumped to his feet, with
+
+his eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement. �To
+
+hell with you and your souls!� he shouted. �Why do you plague me about
+
+souls? Haven�t I got enough to worry, and pain, and distract me already,
+
+without thinking of souls!� He looked so hostile that I thought he was
+
+in for another homicidal fit, so I blew my whistle. The instant,
+
+however, that I did so he became calm, and said apologetically:--
+
+�Forgive me, Doctor; I forgot myself. You do not need any help. I am so
+
+worried in my mind that I am apt to be irritable. If you only knew the
+
+problem I have to face, and that I am working out, you would pity, and
+
+tolerate, and pardon me. Pray do not put me in a strait-waistcoat. I
+
+want to think and I cannot think freely when my body is confined. I am
+
+sure you will understand!� He had evidently self-control; so when the
+
+attendants came I told them not to mind, and they withdrew. Renfield
+
+watched them go; when the door was closed he said, with considerable
+
+dignity and sweetness:--
+
+�Dr. Seward, you have been very considerate towards me. Believe me that
+
+I am very, very grateful to you!� I thought it well to leave him in this
+
+mood, and so I came away. There is certainly something to ponder over in
+
+this man�s state. Several points seem to make what the American
+
+interviewer calls �a story,� if one could only get them in proper order.
+
+Here they are:--
+
+Will not mention �drinking.�
+
+Fears the thought of being burdened with the �soul� of anything.
+
+Has no dread of wanting �life� in the future.
+
+Despises the meaner forms of life altogether, though he dreads being
+
+haunted by their souls.
+
+Logically all these things point one way! he has assurance of some kind
+
+that he will acquire some higher life. He dreads the consequence--the
+
+burden of a soul. Then it is a human life he looks to!
+
+And the assurance--?
+
+Merciful God! the Count has been to him, and there is some new scheme of
+
+terror afoot!
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_Later._--I went after my round to Van Helsing and told him my
+
+suspicion. He grew very grave; and, after thinking the matter over for a
+
+while asked me to take him to Renfield. I did so. As we came to the door
+
+we heard the lunatic within singing gaily, as he used to do in the time
+
+which now seems so long ago. When we entered we saw with amazement that
+
+he had spread out his sugar as of old; the flies, lethargic with the
+
+autumn, were beginning to buzz into the room. We tried to make him talk
+
+of the subject of our previous conversation, but he would not attend. He
+
+went on with his singing, just as though we had not been present. He had
+
+got a scrap of paper and was folding it into a note-book. We had to come
+
+away as ignorant as we went in.
+
+His is a curious case indeed; we must watch him to-night.
+
+_Letter, Mitchell, Sons and Candy to Lord Godalming._
+
+_�1 October._
+
+�My Lord,
+
+�We are at all times only too happy to meet your wishes. We beg, with
+
+regard to the desire of your Lordship, expressed by Mr. Harker on your
+
+behalf, to supply the following information concerning the sale and
+
+purchase of No. 347, Piccadilly. The original vendors are the executors
+
+of the late Mr. Archibald Winter-Suffield. The purchaser is a foreign
+
+nobleman, Count de Ville, who effected the purchase himself paying the
+
+purchase money in notes �over the counter,� if your Lordship will pardon
+
+us using so vulgar an expression. Beyond this we know nothing whatever
+
+of him.
+
+�We are, my Lord,
+
+�Your Lordship�s humble servants,
+
+�MITCHELL, SONS & CANDY.�
+
+_Dr. Seward�s Diary._
+
+_2 October._--I placed a man in the corridor last night, and told him to
+
+make an accurate note of any sound he might hear from Renfield�s room,
+
+and gave him instructions that if there should be anything strange he
+
+was to call me. After dinner, when we had all gathered round the fire
+
+in the study--Mrs. Harker having gone to bed--we discussed the attempts
+
+and discoveries of the day. Harker was the only one who had any result,
+
+and we are in great hopes that his clue may be an important one.
+
+Before going to bed I went round to the patient�s room and looked in
+
+through the observation trap. He was sleeping soundly, and his heart
+
+rose and fell with regular respiration.
+
+This morning the man on duty reported to me that a little after midnight
+
+he was restless and kept saying his prayers somewhat loudly. I asked him
+
+if that was all; he replied that it was all he heard. There was
+
+something about his manner so suspicious that I asked him point blank if
+
+he had been asleep. He denied sleep, but admitted to having �dozed� for
+
+a while. It is too bad that men cannot be trusted unless they are
+
+watched.
+
+To-day Harker is out following up his clue, and Art and Quincey are
+
+looking after horses. Godalming thinks that it will be well to have
+
+horses always in readiness, for when we get the information which we
+
+seek there will be no time to lose. We must sterilise all the imported
+
+earth between sunrise and sunset; we shall thus catch the Count at his
+
+weakest, and without a refuge to fly to. Van Helsing is off to the
+
+British Museum looking up some authorities on ancient medicine. The old
+
+physicians took account of things which their followers do not accept,
+
+and the Professor is searching for witch and demon cures which may be
+
+useful to us later.
+
+I sometimes think we must be all mad and that we shall wake to sanity in
+
+strait-waistcoats.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_Later._--We have met again. We seem at last to be on the track, and our
+
+work of to-morrow may be the beginning of the end. I wonder if
+
+Renfield�s quiet has anything to do with this. His moods have so
+
+followed the doings of the Count, that the coming destruction of the
+
+monster may be carried to him in some subtle way. If we could only get
+
+some hint as to what passed in his mind, between the time of my argument
+
+with him to-day and his resumption of fly-catching, it might afford us a
+
+valuable clue. He is now seemingly quiet for a spell.... Is he?---- That
+
+wild yell seemed to come from his room....
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+The attendant came bursting into my room and told me that Renfield had
+
+somehow met with some accident. He had heard him yell; and when he went
+
+to him found him lying on his face on the floor, all covered with blood.
+
+I must go at once....

+CHAPTER XIX
+
+JONATHAN HARKER�S JOURNAL
+
+_1 October, 5 a. m._--I went with the party to the search with an easy
+
+mind, for I think I never saw Mina so absolutely strong and well. I am
+
+so glad that she consented to hold back and let us men do the work.
+
+Somehow, it was a dread to me that she was in this fearful business at
+
+all; but now that her work is done, and that it is due to her energy and
+
+brains and foresight that the whole story is put together in such a way
+
+that every point tells, she may well feel that her part is finished, and
+
+that she can henceforth leave the rest to us. We were, I think, all a
+
+little upset by the scene with Mr. Renfield. When we came away from his
+
+room we were silent till we got back to the study. Then Mr. Morris said
+
+to Dr. Seward:--
+
+�Say, Jack, if that man wasn�t attempting a bluff, he is about the
+
+sanest lunatic I ever saw. I�m not sure, but I believe that he had some
+
+serious purpose, and if he had, it was pretty rough on him not to get a
+
+chance.� Lord Godalming and I were silent, but Dr. Van Helsing added:--
+
+�Friend John, you know more of lunatics than I do, and I�m glad of it,
+
+for I fear that if it had been to me to decide I would before that last
+
+hysterical outburst have given him free. But we live and learn, and in
+
+our present task we must take no chance, as my friend Quincey would say.
+
+All is best as they are.� Dr. Seward seemed to answer them both in a
+
+dreamy kind of way:--
+
+�I don�t know but that I agree with you. If that man had been an
+
+ordinary lunatic I would have taken my chance of trusting him; but he
+
+seems so mixed up with the Count in an indexy kind of way that I am
+
+afraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads. I can�t forget how
+
+he prayed with almost equal fervour for a cat, and then tried to tear my
+
+throat out with his teeth. Besides, he called the Count �lord and
+
+master,� and he may want to get out to help him in some diabolical way.
+
+That horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to help
+
+him, so I suppose he isn�t above trying to use a respectable lunatic. He
+
+certainly did seem earnest, though. I only hope we have done what is
+
+best. These things, in conjunction with the wild work we have in hand,
+
+help to unnerve a man.� The Professor stepped over, and laying his hand
+
+on his shoulder, said in his grave, kindly way:--
+
+�Friend John, have no fear. We are trying to do our duty in a very sad
+
+and terrible case; we can only do as we deem best. What else have we to
+
+hope for, except the pity of the good God?� Lord Godalming had slipped
+
+away for a few minutes, but now he returned. He held up a little silver
+
+whistle, as he remarked:--
+
+�That old place may be full of rats, and if so, I�ve got an antidote on
+
+call.� Having passed the wall, we took our way to the house, taking care
+
+to keep in the shadows of the trees on the lawn when the moonlight shone
+
+out. When we got to the porch the Professor opened his bag and took out
+
+a lot of things, which he laid on the step, sorting them into four
+
+little groups, evidently one for each. Then he spoke:--
+
+�My friends, we are going into a terrible danger, and we need arms of
+
+many kinds. Our enemy is not merely spiritual. Remember that he has the
+
+strength of twenty men, and that, though our necks or our windpipes are
+
+of the common kind--and therefore breakable or crushable--his are not
+
+amenable to mere strength. A stronger man, or a body of men more strong
+
+in all than him, can at certain times hold him; but they cannot hurt him
+
+as we can be hurt by him. We must, therefore, guard ourselves from his
+
+touch. Keep this near your heart�--as he spoke he lifted a little silver
+
+crucifix and held it out to me, I being nearest to him--�put these
+
+flowers round your neck�--here he handed to me a wreath of withered
+
+garlic blossoms--�for other enemies more mundane, this revolver and this
+
+knife; and for aid in all, these so small electric lamps, which you can
+
+fasten to your breast; and for all, and above all at the last, this,
+
+which we must not desecrate needless.� This was a portion of Sacred
+
+Wafer, which he put in an envelope and handed to me. Each of the others
+
+was similarly equipped. �Now,� he said, �friend John, where are the
+
+skeleton keys? If so that we can open the door, we need not break house
+
+by the window, as before at Miss Lucy�s.�
+
+Dr. Seward tried one or two skeleton keys, his mechanical dexterity as a
+
+surgeon standing him in good stead. Presently he got one to suit; after
+
+a little play back and forward the bolt yielded, and, with a rusty
+
+clang, shot back. We pressed on the door, the rusty hinges creaked, and
+
+it slowly opened. It was startlingly like the image conveyed to me in
+
+Dr. Seward�s diary of the opening of Miss Westenra�s tomb; I fancy that
+
+the same idea seemed to strike the others, for with one accord they
+
+shrank back. The Professor was the first to move forward, and stepped
+
+into the open door.
+
+�_In manus tuas, Domine!_� he said, crossing himself as he passed over
+
+the threshold. We closed the door behind us, lest when we should have
+
+lit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the road. The
+
+Professor carefully tried the lock, lest we might not be able to open it
+
+from within should we be in a hurry making our exit. Then we all lit our
+
+lamps and proceeded on our search.
+
+The light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms, as the
+
+rays crossed each other, or the opacity of our bodies threw great
+
+shadows. I could not for my life get away from the feeling that there
+
+was some one else amongst us. I suppose it was the recollection, so
+
+powerfully brought home to me by the grim surroundings, of that terrible
+
+experience in Transylvania. I think the feeling was common to us all,
+
+for I noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders at every
+
+sound and every new shadow, just as I felt myself doing.
+
+The whole place was thick with dust. The floor was seemingly inches
+
+deep, except where there were recent footsteps, in which on holding down
+
+my lamp I could see marks of hobnails where the dust was cracked. The
+
+walls were fluffy and heavy with dust, and in the corners were masses of
+
+spider�s webs, whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like old
+
+tattered rags as the weight had torn them partly down. On a table in the
+
+hall was a great bunch of keys, with a time-yellowed label on each. They
+
+had been used several times, for on the table were several similar rents
+
+in the blanket of dust, similar to that exposed when the Professor
+
+lifted them. He turned to me and said:--
+
+�You know this place, Jonathan. You have copied maps of it, and you know
+
+it at least more than we do. Which is the way to the chapel?� I had an
+
+idea of its direction, though on my former visit I had not been able to
+
+get admission to it; so I led the way, and after a few wrong turnings
+
+found myself opposite a low, arched oaken door, ribbed with iron bands.
+
+�This is the spot,� said the Professor as he turned his lamp on a small
+
+map of the house, copied from the file of my original correspondence
+
+regarding the purchase. With a little trouble we found the key on the
+
+bunch and opened the door. We were prepared for some unpleasantness, for
+
+as we were opening the door a faint, malodorous air seemed to exhale
+
+through the gaps, but none of us ever expected such an odour as we
+
+encountered. None of the others had met the Count at all at close
+
+quarters, and when I had seen him he was either in the fasting stage of
+
+his existence in his rooms or, when he was gloated with fresh blood, in
+
+a ruined building open to the air; but here the place was small and
+
+close, and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul. There was
+
+an earthy smell, as of some dry miasma, which came through the fouler
+
+air. But as to the odour itself, how shall I describe it? It was not
+
+alone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and with the
+
+pungent, acrid smell of blood, but it seemed as though corruption had
+
+become itself corrupt. Faugh! it sickens me to think of it. Every breath
+
+exhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place and
+
+intensified its loathsomeness.
+
+Under ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought our
+
+enterprise to an end; but this was no ordinary case, and the high and
+
+terrible purpose in which we were involved gave us a strength which rose
+
+above merely physical considerations. After the involuntary shrinking
+
+consequent on the first nauseous whiff, we one and all set about our
+
+work as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses.
+
+We made an accurate examination of the place, the Professor saying as we
+
+began:--
+
+�The first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left; we must then
+
+examine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannot get some
+
+clue as to what has become of the rest.� A glance was sufficient to show
+
+how many remained, for the great earth chests were bulky, and there was
+
+no mistaking them.
+
+There were only twenty-nine left out of the fifty! Once I got a fright,
+
+for, seeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted
+
+door into the dark passage beyond, I looked too, and for an instant my
+
+heart stood still. Somewhere, looking out from the shadow, I seemed to
+
+see the high lights of the Count�s evil face, the ridge of the nose, the
+
+red eyes, the red lips, the awful pallor. It was only for a moment, for,
+
+as Lord Godalming said, �I thought I saw a face, but it was only the
+
+shadows,� and resumed his inquiry, I turned my lamp in the direction,
+
+and stepped into the passage. There was no sign of any one; and as there
+
+were no corners, no doors, no aperture of any kind, but only the solid
+
+walls of the passage, there could be no hiding-place even for _him_. I
+
+took it that fear had helped imagination, and said nothing.
+
+A few minutes later I saw Morris step suddenly back from a corner, which
+
+he was examining. We all followed his movements with our eyes, for
+
+undoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us, and we saw a whole mass
+
+of phosphorescence, which twinkled like stars. We all instinctively drew
+
+back. The whole place was becoming alive with rats.
+
+For a moment or two we stood appalled, all save Lord Godalming, who was
+
+seemingly prepared for such an emergency. Rushing over to the great
+
+iron-bound oaken door, which Dr. Seward had described from the outside,
+
+and which I had seen myself, he turned the key in the lock, drew the
+
+huge bolts, and swung the door open. Then, taking his little silver
+
+whistle from his pocket, he blew a low, shrill call. It was answered
+
+from behind Dr. Seward�s house by the yelping of dogs, and after about a
+
+minute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house.
+
+Unconsciously we had all moved towards the door, and as we moved I
+
+noticed that the dust had been much disturbed: the boxes which had been
+
+taken out had been brought this way. But even in the minute that had
+
+elapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased. They seemed to
+
+swarm over the place all at once, till the lamplight, shining on their
+
+moving dark bodies and glittering, baleful eyes, made the place look
+
+like a bank of earth set with fireflies. The dogs dashed on, but at the
+
+threshold suddenly stopped and snarled, and then, simultaneously lifting
+
+their noses, began to howl in most lugubrious fashion. The rats were
+
+multiplying in thousands, and we moved out.
+
+Lord Godalming lifted one of the dogs, and carrying him in, placed him
+
+on the floor. The instant his feet touched the ground he seemed to
+
+recover his courage, and rushed at his natural enemies. They fled before
+
+him so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score, the other
+
+dogs, who had by now been lifted in the same manner, had but small prey
+
+ere the whole mass had vanished.
+
+With their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed, for
+
+the dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at
+
+their prostrate foes, and turned them over and over and tossed them in
+
+the air with vicious shakes. We all seemed to find our spirits rise.
+
+Whether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of
+
+the chapel door, or the relief which we experienced by finding ourselves
+
+in the open I know not; but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed to
+
+slip from us like a robe, and the occasion of our coming lost something
+
+of its grim significance, though we did not slacken a whit in our
+
+resolution. We closed the outer door and barred and locked it, and
+
+bringing the dogs with us, began our search of the house. We found
+
+nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions, and all
+
+untouched save for my own footsteps when I had made my first visit.
+
+Never once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness, and even when
+
+we returned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had been
+
+rabbit-hunting in a summer wood.
+
+The morning was quickening in the east when we emerged from the front.
+
+Dr. Van Helsing had taken the key of the hall-door from the bunch, and
+
+locked the door in orthodox fashion, putting the key into his pocket
+
+when he had done.
+
+�So far,� he said, �our night has been eminently successful. No harm has
+
+come to us such as I feared might be and yet we have ascertained how
+
+many boxes are missing. More than all do I rejoice that this, our
+
+first--and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous--step has been
+
+accomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet Madam Mina or
+
+troubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and
+
+smells of horror which she might never forget. One lesson, too, we have
+
+learned, if it be allowable to argue _a particulari_: that the brute
+
+beasts which are to the Count�s command are yet themselves not amenable
+
+to his spiritual power; for look, these rats that would come to his
+
+call, just as from his castle top he summon the wolves to your going and
+
+to that poor mother�s cry, though they come to him, they run pell-mell
+
+from the so little dogs of my friend Arthur. We have other matters
+
+before us, other dangers, other fears; and that monster--he has not used
+
+his power over the brute world for the only or the last time to-night.
+
+So be it that he has gone elsewhere. Good! It has given us opportunity
+
+to cry �check� in some ways in this chess game, which we play for the
+
+stake of human souls. And now let us go home. The dawn is close at hand,
+
+and we have reason to be content with our first night�s work. It may be
+
+ordained that we have many nights and days to follow, if full of peril;
+
+but we must go on, and from no danger shall we shrink.�
+
+The house was silent when we got back, save for some poor creature who
+
+was screaming away in one of the distant wards, and a low, moaning sound
+
+from Renfield�s room. The poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself,
+
+after the manner of the insane, with needless thoughts of pain.
+
+I came tiptoe into our own room, and found Mina asleep, breathing so
+
+softly that I had to put my ear down to hear it. She looks paler than
+
+usual. I hope the meeting to-night has not upset her. I am truly
+
+thankful that she is to be left out of our future work, and even of our
+
+deliberations. It is too great a strain for a woman to bear. I did not
+
+think so at first, but I know better now. Therefore I am glad that it is
+
+settled. There may be things which would frighten her to hear; and yet
+
+to conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her if once she
+
+suspected that there was any concealment. Henceforth our work is to be a
+
+sealed book to her, till at least such time as we can tell her that all
+
+is finished, and the earth free from a monster of the nether world. I
+
+daresay it will be difficult to begin to keep silence after such
+
+confidence as ours; but I must be resolute, and to-morrow I shall keep
+
+dark over to-night�s doings, and shall refuse to speak of anything that
+
+has happened. I rest on the sofa, so as not to disturb her.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_1 October, later._--I suppose it was natural that we should have all
+
+overslept ourselves, for the day was a busy one, and the night had no
+
+rest at all. Even Mina must have felt its exhaustion, for though I slept
+
+till the sun was high, I was awake before her, and had to call two or
+
+three times before she awoke. Indeed, she was so sound asleep that for a
+
+few seconds she did not recognize me, but looked at me with a sort of
+
+blank terror, as one looks who has been waked out of a bad dream. She
+
+complained a little of being tired, and I let her rest till later in the
+
+day. We now know of twenty-one boxes having been removed, and if it be
+
+that several were taken in any of these removals we may be able to trace
+
+them all. Such will, of course, immensely simplify our labour, and the
+
+sooner the matter is attended to the better. I shall look up Thomas
+
+Snelling to-day.
+
+_Dr. Seward�s Diary._
+
+_1 October._--It was towards noon when I was awakened by the Professor
+
+walking into my room. He was more jolly and cheerful than usual, and it
+
+is quite evident that last night�s work has helped to take some of the
+
+brooding weight off his mind. After going over the adventure of the
+
+night he suddenly said:--
+
+�Your patient interests me much. May it be that with you I visit him
+
+this morning? Or if that you are too occupy, I can go alone if it may
+
+be. It is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophy,
+
+and reason so sound.� I had some work to do which pressed, so I told him
+
+that if he would go alone I would be glad, as then I should not have to
+
+keep him waiting; so I called an attendant and gave him the necessary
+
+instructions. Before the Professor left the room I cautioned him against
+
+getting any false impression from my patient. �But,� he answered, �I
+
+want him to talk of himself and of his delusion as to consuming live
+
+things. He said to Madam Mina, as I see in your diary of yesterday, that
+
+he had once had such a belief. Why do you smile, friend John?�
+
+�Excuse me,� I said, �but the answer is here.� I laid my hand on the
+
+type-written matter. �When our sane and learned lunatic made that very
+
+statement of how he _used_ to consume life, his mouth was actually
+
+nauseous with the flies and spiders which he had eaten just before Mrs.
+
+Harker entered the room.� Van Helsing smiled in turn. �Good!� he said.
+
+�Your memory is true, friend John. I should have remembered. And yet it
+
+is this very obliquity of thought and memory which makes mental disease
+
+such a fascinating study. Perhaps I may gain more knowledge out of the
+
+folly of this madman than I shall from the teaching of the most wise.
+
+Who knows?� I went on with my work, and before long was through that in
+
+hand. It seemed that the time had been very short indeed, but there was
+
+Van Helsing back in the study. �Do I interrupt?� he asked politely as he
+
+stood at the door.
+
+�Not at all,� I answered. �Come in. My work is finished, and I am free.
+
+I can go with you now, if you like.
+
+�It is needless; I have seen him!�
+
+�Well?�
+
+�I fear that he does not appraise me at much. Our interview was short.
+
+When I entered his room he was sitting on a stool in the centre, with
+
+his elbows on his knees, and his face was the picture of sullen
+
+discontent. I spoke to him as cheerfully as I could, and with such a
+
+measure of respect as I could assume. He made no reply whatever. �Don�t
+
+you know me?� I asked. His answer was not reassuring: �I know you well
+
+enough; you are the old fool Van Helsing. I wish you would take yourself
+
+and your idiotic brain theories somewhere else. Damn all thick-headed
+
+Dutchmen!� Not a word more would he say, but sat in his implacable
+
+sullenness as indifferent to me as though I had not been in the room at
+
+all. Thus departed for this time my chance of much learning from this so
+
+clever lunatic; so I shall go, if I may, and cheer myself with a few
+
+happy words with that sweet soul Madam Mina. Friend John, it does
+
+rejoice me unspeakable that she is no more to be pained, no more to be
+
+worried with our terrible things. Though we shall much miss her help, it
+
+is better so.�
+
+�I agree with you with all my heart,� I answered earnestly, for I did
+
+not want him to weaken in this matter. �Mrs. Harker is better out of it.
+
+Things are quite bad enough for us, all men of the world, and who have
+
+been in many tight places in our time; but it is no place for a woman,
+
+and if she had remained in touch with the affair, it would in time
+
+infallibly have wrecked her.�
+
+So Van Helsing has gone to confer with Mrs. Harker and Harker; Quincey
+
+and Art are all out following up the clues as to the earth-boxes. I
+
+shall finish my round of work and we shall meet to-night.
+
+_Mina Harker�s Journal._
+
+_1 October._--It is strange to me to be kept in the dark as I am to-day;
+
+after Jonathan�s full confidence for so many years, to see him
+
+manifestly avoid certain matters, and those the most vital of all. This
+
+morning I slept late after the fatigues of yesterday, and though
+
+Jonathan was late too, he was the earlier. He spoke to me before he went
+
+out, never more sweetly or tenderly, but he never mentioned a word of
+
+what had happened in the visit to the Count�s house. And yet he must
+
+have known how terribly anxious I was. Poor dear fellow! I suppose it
+
+must have distressed him even more than it did me. They all agreed that
+
+it was best that I should not be drawn further into this awful work, and
+
+I acquiesced. But to think that he keeps anything from me! And now I am
+
+crying like a silly fool, when I _know_ it comes from my husband�s great
+
+love and from the good, good wishes of those other strong men.
+
+That has done me good. Well, some day Jonathan will tell me all; and
+
+lest it should ever be that he should think for a moment that I kept
+
+anything from him, I still keep my journal as usual. Then if he has
+
+feared of my trust I shall show it to him, with every thought of my
+
+heart put down for his dear eyes to read. I feel strangely sad and
+
+low-spirited to-day. I suppose it is the reaction from the terrible
+
+excitement.
+
+Last night I went to bed when the men had gone, simply because they told
+
+me to. I didn�t feel sleepy, and I did feel full of devouring anxiety. I
+
+kept thinking over everything that has been ever since Jonathan came to
+
+see me in London, and it all seems like a horrible tragedy, with fate
+
+pressing on relentlessly to some destined end. Everything that one does
+
+seems, no matter how right it may be, to bring on the very thing which
+
+is most to be deplored. If I hadn�t gone to Whitby, perhaps poor dear
+
+Lucy would be with us now. She hadn�t taken to visiting the churchyard
+
+till I came, and if she hadn�t come there in the day-time with me she
+
+wouldn�t have walked there in her sleep; and if she hadn�t gone there at
+
+night and asleep, that monster couldn�t have destroyed her as he did.
+
+Oh, why did I ever go to Whitby? There now, crying again! I wonder what
+
+has come over me to-day. I must hide it from Jonathan, for if he knew
+
+that I had been crying twice in one morning--I, who never cried on my
+
+own account, and whom he has never caused to shed a tear--the dear
+
+fellow would fret his heart out. I shall put a bold face on, and if I do
+
+feel weepy, he shall never see it. I suppose it is one of the lessons
+
+that we poor women have to learn....
+
+I can�t quite remember how I fell asleep last night. I remember hearing
+
+the sudden barking of the dogs and a lot of queer sounds, like praying
+
+on a very tumultuous scale, from Mr. Renfield�s room, which is somewhere
+
+under this. And then there was silence over everything, silence so
+
+profound that it startled me, and I got up and looked out of the window.
+
+All was dark and silent, the black shadows thrown by the moonlight
+
+seeming full of a silent mystery of their own. Not a thing seemed to be
+
+stirring, but all to be grim and fixed as death or fate; so that a thin
+
+streak of white mist, that crept with almost imperceptible slowness
+
+across the grass towards the house, seemed to have a sentience and a
+
+vitality of its own. I think that the digression of my thoughts must
+
+have done me good, for when I got back to bed I found a lethargy
+
+creeping over me. I lay a while, but could not quite sleep, so I got out
+
+and looked out of the window again. The mist was spreading, and was now
+
+close up to the house, so that I could see it lying thick against the
+
+wall, as though it were stealing up to the windows. The poor man was
+
+more loud than ever, and though I could not distinguish a word he said,
+
+I could in some way recognise in his tones some passionate entreaty on
+
+his part. Then there was the sound of a struggle, and I knew that the
+
+attendants were dealing with him. I was so frightened that I crept into
+
+bed, and pulled the clothes over my head, putting my fingers in my ears.
+
+I was not then a bit sleepy, at least so I thought; but I must have
+
+fallen asleep, for, except dreams, I do not remember anything until the
+
+morning, when Jonathan woke me. I think that it took me an effort and a
+
+little time to realise where I was, and that it was Jonathan who was
+
+bending over me. My dream was very peculiar, and was almost typical of
+
+the way that waking thoughts become merged in, or continued in, dreams.
+
+I thought that I was asleep, and waiting for Jonathan to come back. I
+
+was very anxious about him, and I was powerless to act; my feet, and my
+
+hands, and my brain were weighted, so that nothing could proceed at the
+
+usual pace. And so I slept uneasily and thought. Then it began to dawn
+
+upon me that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold. I put back the
+
+clothes from my face, and found, to my surprise, that all was dim
+
+around. The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, but turned down,
+
+came only like a tiny red spark through the fog, which had evidently
+
+grown thicker and poured into the room. Then it occurred to me that I
+
+had shut the window before I had come to bed. I would have got out to
+
+make certain on the point, but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my
+
+limbs and even my will. I lay still and endured; that was all. I closed
+
+my eyes, but could still see through my eyelids. (It is wonderful what
+
+tricks our dreams play us, and how conveniently we can imagine.) The
+
+mist grew thicker and thicker and I could see now how it came in, for I
+
+could see it like smoke--or with the white energy of boiling
+
+water--pouring in, not through the window, but through the joinings of
+
+the door. It got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it became
+
+concentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room, through the top
+
+of which I could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye. Things
+
+began to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column was now
+
+whirling in the room, and through it all came the scriptural words �a
+
+pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night.� Was it indeed some such
+
+spiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep? But the pillar was
+
+composed of both the day and the night-guiding, for the fire was in the
+
+red eye, which at the thought got a new fascination for me; till, as I
+
+looked, the fire divided, and seemed to shine on me through the fog like
+
+two red eyes, such as Lucy told me of in her momentary mental wandering
+
+when, on the cliff, the dying sunlight struck the windows of St. Mary�s
+
+Church. Suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus that Jonathan
+
+had seen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling mist
+
+in the moonlight, and in my dream I must have fainted, for all became
+
+black darkness. The last conscious effort which imagination made was to
+
+show me a livid white face bending over me out of the mist. I must be
+
+careful of such dreams, for they would unseat one�s reason if there were
+
+too much of them. I would get Dr. Van Helsing or Dr. Seward to prescribe
+
+something for me which would make me sleep, only that I fear to alarm
+
+them. Such a dream at the present time would become woven into their
+
+fears for me. To-night I shall strive hard to sleep naturally. If I do
+
+not, I shall to-morrow night get them to give me a dose of chloral; that
+
+cannot hurt me for once, and it will give me a good night�s sleep. Last
+
+night tired me more than if I had not slept at all.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_2 October 10 p. m._--Last night I slept, but did not dream. I must have
+
+slept soundly, for I was not waked by Jonathan coming to bed; but the
+
+sleep has not refreshed me, for to-day I feel terribly weak and
+
+spiritless. I spent all yesterday trying to read, or lying down dozing.
+
+In the afternoon Mr. Renfield asked if he might see me. Poor man, he was
+
+very gentle, and when I came away he kissed my hand and bade God bless
+
+me. Some way it affected me much; I am crying when I think of him. This
+
+is a new weakness, of which I must be careful. Jonathan would be
+
+miserable if he knew I had been crying. He and the others were out till
+
+dinner-time, and they all came in tired. I did what I could to brighten
+
+them up, and I suppose that the effort did me good, for I forgot how
+
+tired I was. After dinner they sent me to bed, and all went off to smoke
+
+together, as they said, but I knew that they wanted to tell each other
+
+of what had occurred to each during the day; I could see from Jonathan�s
+
+manner that he had something important to communicate. I was not so
+
+sleepy as I should have been; so before they went I asked Dr. Seward to
+
+give me a little opiate of some kind, as I had not slept well the night
+
+before. He very kindly made me up a sleeping draught, which he gave to
+
+me, telling me that it would do me no harm, as it was very mild.... I
+
+have taken it, and am waiting for sleep, which still keeps aloof. I hope
+
+I have not done wrong, for as sleep begins to flirt with me, a new fear
+
+comes: that I may have been foolish in thus depriving myself of the
+
+power of waking. I might want it. Here comes sleep. Good-night.

+CHAPTER XIV
+
+MINA HARKER�S JOURNAL
+
+_23 September_.--Jonathan is better after a bad night. I am so glad that
+
+he has plenty of work to do, for that keeps his mind off the terrible
+
+things; and oh, I am rejoiced that he is not now weighed down with the
+
+responsibility of his new position. I knew he would be true to himself,
+
+and now how proud I am to see my Jonathan rising to the height of his
+
+advancement and keeping pace in all ways with the duties that come upon
+
+him. He will be away all day till late, for he said he could not lunch
+
+at home. My household work is done, so I shall take his foreign journal,
+
+and lock myself up in my room and read it....
+
+_24 September_.--I hadn�t the heart to write last night; that terrible
+
+record of Jonathan�s upset me so. Poor dear! How he must have suffered,
+
+whether it be true or only imagination. I wonder if there is any truth
+
+in it at all. Did he get his brain fever, and then write all those
+
+terrible things, or had he some cause for it all? I suppose I shall
+
+never know, for I dare not open the subject to him.... And yet that man
+
+we saw yesterday! He seemed quite certain of him.... Poor fellow! I
+
+suppose it was the funeral upset him and sent his mind back on some
+
+train of thought.... He believes it all himself. I remember how on our
+
+wedding-day he said: �Unless some solemn duty come upon me to go back to
+
+the bitter hours, asleep or awake, mad or sane.� There seems to be
+
+through it all some thread of continuity.... That fearful Count was
+
+coming to London.... If it should be, and he came to London, with his
+
+teeming millions.... There may be a solemn duty; and if it come we must
+
+not shrink from it.... I shall be prepared. I shall get my typewriter
+
+this very hour and begin transcribing. Then we shall be ready for other
+
+eyes if required. And if it be wanted; then, perhaps, if I am ready,
+
+poor Jonathan may not be upset, for I can speak for him and never let
+
+him be troubled or worried with it at all. If ever Jonathan quite gets
+
+over the nervousness he may want to tell me of it all, and I can ask him
+
+questions and find out things, and see how I may comfort him.
+
+_Letter, Van Helsing to Mrs. Harker._
+
+�_24 September._
+
+(_Confidence_)
+
+�Dear Madam,--
+
+�I pray you to pardon my writing, in that I am so far friend as that I
+
+sent to you sad news of Miss Lucy Westenra�s death. By the kindness of
+
+Lord Godalming, I am empowered to read her letters and papers, for I am
+
+deeply concerned about certain matters vitally important. In them I find
+
+some letters from you, which show how great friends you were and how you
+
+love her. Oh, Madam Mina, by that love, I implore you, help me. It is
+
+for others� good that I ask--to redress great wrong, and to lift much
+
+and terrible troubles--that may be more great than you can know. May it
+
+be that I see you? You can trust me. I am friend of Dr. John Seward and
+
+of Lord Godalming (that was Arthur of Miss Lucy). I must keep it private
+
+for the present from all. I should come to Exeter to see you at once if
+
+you tell me I am privilege to come, and where and when. I implore your
+
+pardon, madam. I have read your letters to poor Lucy, and know how good
+
+you are and how your husband suffer; so I pray you, if it may be,
+
+enlighten him not, lest it may harm. Again your pardon, and forgive me.
+
+�VAN HELSING.�
+
+_Telegram, Mrs. Harker to Van Helsing._
+
+�_25 September._--Come to-day by quarter-past ten train if you can catch
+
+it. Can see you any time you call.
+
+�WILHELMINA HARKER.�
+
+MINA HARKER�S JOURNAL.
+
+_25 September._--I cannot help feeling terribly excited as the time
+
+draws near for the visit of Dr. Van Helsing, for somehow I expect that
+
+it will throw some light upon Jonathan�s sad experience; and as he
+
+attended poor dear Lucy in her last illness, he can tell me all about
+
+her. That is the reason of his coming; it is concerning Lucy and her
+
+sleep-walking, and not about Jonathan. Then I shall never know the real
+
+truth now! How silly I am. That awful journal gets hold of my
+
+imagination and tinges everything with something of its own colour. Of
+
+course it is about Lucy. That habit came back to the poor dear, and that
+
+awful night on the cliff must have made her ill. I had almost forgotten
+
+in my own affairs how ill she was afterwards. She must have told him
+
+of her sleep-walking adventure on the cliff, and that I knew all about
+
+it; and now he wants me to tell him what she knows, so that he may
+
+understand. I hope I did right in not saying anything of it to Mrs.
+
+Westenra; I should never forgive myself if any act of mine, were it even
+
+a negative one, brought harm on poor dear Lucy. I hope, too, Dr. Van
+
+Helsing will not blame me; I have had so much trouble and anxiety of
+
+late that I feel I cannot bear more just at present.
+
+I suppose a cry does us all good at times--clears the air as other rain
+
+does. Perhaps it was reading the journal yesterday that upset me, and
+
+then Jonathan went away this morning to stay away from me a whole day
+
+and night, the first time we have been parted since our marriage. I do
+
+hope the dear fellow will take care of himself, and that nothing will
+
+occur to upset him. It is two o�clock, and the doctor will be here soon
+
+now. I shall say nothing of Jonathan�s journal unless he asks me. I am
+
+so glad I have type-written out my own journal, so that, in case he asks
+
+about Lucy, I can hand it to him; it will save much questioning.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_Later._--He has come and gone. Oh, what a strange meeting, and how it
+
+all makes my head whirl round! I feel like one in a dream. Can it be all
+
+possible, or even a part of it? If I had not read Jonathan�s journal
+
+first, I should never have accepted even a possibility. Poor, poor, dear
+
+Jonathan! How he must have suffered. Please the good God, all this may
+
+not upset him again. I shall try to save him from it; but it may be even
+
+a consolation and a help to him--terrible though it be and awful in its
+
+consequences--to know for certain that his eyes and ears and brain did
+
+not deceive him, and that it is all true. It may be that it is the doubt
+
+which haunts him; that when the doubt is removed, no matter
+
+which--waking or dreaming--may prove the truth, he will be more
+
+satisfied and better able to bear the shock. Dr. Van Helsing must be a
+
+good man as well as a clever one if he is Arthur�s friend and Dr.
+
+Seward�s, and if they brought him all the way from Holland to look after
+
+Lucy. I feel from having seen him that he _is_ good and kind and of a
+
+noble nature. When he comes to-morrow I shall ask him about Jonathan;
+
+and then, please God, all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to a good
+
+end. I used to think I would like to practise interviewing; Jonathan�s
+
+friend on �The Exeter News� told him that memory was everything in such
+
+work--that you must be able to put down exactly almost every word
+
+spoken, even if you had to refine some of it afterwards. Here was a rare
+
+interview; I shall try to record it _verbatim_.
+
+It was half-past two o�clock when the knock came. I took my courage _�
+
+deux mains_ and waited. In a few minutes Mary opened the door, and
+
+announced �Dr. Van Helsing.�
+
+I rose and bowed, and he came towards me; a man of medium weight,
+
+strongly built, with his shoulders set back over a broad, deep chest and
+
+a neck well balanced on the trunk as the head is on the neck. The poise
+
+of the head strikes one at once as indicative of thought and power; the
+
+head is noble, well-sized, broad, and large behind the ears. The face,
+
+clean-shaven, shows a hard, square chin, a large, resolute, mobile
+
+mouth, a good-sized nose, rather straight, but with quick, sensitive
+
+nostrils, that seem to broaden as the big, bushy brows come down and the
+
+mouth tightens. The forehead is broad and fine, rising at first almost
+
+straight and then sloping back above two bumps or ridges wide apart;
+
+such a forehead that the reddish hair cannot possibly tumble over it,
+
+but falls naturally back and to the sides. Big, dark blue eyes are set
+
+widely apart, and are quick and tender or stern with the man�s moods. He
+
+said to me:--
+
+�Mrs. Harker, is it not?� I bowed assent.
+
+�That was Miss Mina Murray?� Again I assented.
+
+�It is Mina Murray that I came to see that was friend of that poor dear
+
+child Lucy Westenra. Madam Mina, it is on account of the dead I come.�
+
+�Sir,� I said, �you could have no better claim on me than that you were
+
+a friend and helper of Lucy Westenra.� And I held out my hand. He took
+
+it and said tenderly:--
+
+�Oh, Madam Mina, I knew that the friend of that poor lily girl must be
+
+good, but I had yet to learn----� He finished his speech with a courtly
+
+bow. I asked him what it was that he wanted to see me about, so he at
+
+once began:--
+
+�I have read your letters to Miss Lucy. Forgive me, but I had to begin
+
+to inquire somewhere, and there was none to ask. I know that you were
+
+with her at Whitby. She sometimes kept a diary--you need not look
+
+surprised, Madam Mina; it was begun after you had left, and was in
+
+imitation of you--and in that diary she traces by inference certain
+
+things to a sleep-walking in which she puts down that you saved her. In
+
+great perplexity then I come to you, and ask you out of your so much
+
+kindness to tell me all of it that you can remember.�
+
+�I can tell you, I think, Dr. Van Helsing, all about it.�
+
+�Ah, then you have good memory for facts, for details? It is not always
+
+so with young ladies.�
+
+�No, doctor, but I wrote it all down at the time. I can show it to you
+
+if you like.�
+
+�Oh, Madam Mina, I will be grateful; you will do me much favour.� I
+
+could not resist the temptation of mystifying him a bit--I suppose it is
+
+some of the taste of the original apple that remains still in our
+
+mouths--so I handed him the shorthand diary. He took it with a grateful
+
+bow, and said:--
+
+�May I read it?�
+
+�If you wish,� I answered as demurely as I could. He opened it, and for
+
+an instant his face fell. Then he stood up and bowed.
+
+�Oh, you so clever woman!� he said. �I knew long that Mr. Jonathan was a
+
+man of much thankfulness; but see, his wife have all the good things.
+
+And will you not so much honour me and so help me as to read it for me?
+
+Alas! I know not the shorthand.� By this time my little joke was over,
+
+and I was almost ashamed; so I took the typewritten copy from my
+
+workbasket and handed it to him.
+
+�Forgive me,� I said: �I could not help it; but I had been thinking that
+
+it was of dear Lucy that you wished to ask, and so that you might not
+
+have time to wait--not on my account, but because I know your time must
+
+be precious--I have written it out on the typewriter for you.�
+
+He took it and his eyes glistened. �You are so good,� he said. �And may
+
+I read it now? I may want to ask you some things when I have read.�
+
+�By all means,� I said, �read it over whilst I order lunch; and then you
+
+can ask me questions whilst we eat.� He bowed and settled himself in a
+
+chair with his back to the light, and became absorbed in the papers,
+
+whilst I went to see after lunch chiefly in order that he might not be
+
+disturbed. When I came back, I found him walking hurriedly up and down
+
+the room, his face all ablaze with excitement. He rushed up to me and
+
+took me by both hands.
+
+�Oh, Madam Mina,� he said, �how can I say what I owe to you? This paper
+
+is as sunshine. It opens the gate to me. I am daze, I am dazzle, with so
+
+much light, and yet clouds roll in behind the light every time. But that
+
+you do not, cannot, comprehend. Oh, but I am grateful to you, you so
+
+clever woman. Madam�--he said this very solemnly--�if ever Abraham Van
+
+Helsing can do anything for you or yours, I trust you will let me know.
+
+It will be pleasure and delight if I may serve you as a friend; as a
+
+friend, but all I have ever learned, all I can ever do, shall be for you
+
+and those you love. There are darknesses in life, and there are lights;
+
+you are one of the lights. You will have happy life and good life, and
+
+your husband will be blessed in you.�
+
+�But, doctor, you praise me too much, and--and you do not know me.�
+
+�Not know you--I, who am old, and who have studied all my life men and
+
+women; I, who have made my specialty the brain and all that belongs to
+
+him and all that follow from him! And I have read your diary that you
+
+have so goodly written for me, and which breathes out truth in every
+
+line. I, who have read your so sweet letter to poor Lucy of your
+
+marriage and your trust, not know you! Oh, Madam Mina, good women tell
+
+all their lives, and by day and by hour and by minute, such things that
+
+angels can read; and we men who wish to know have in us something of
+
+angels� eyes. Your husband is noble nature, and you are noble too, for
+
+you trust, and trust cannot be where there is mean nature. And your
+
+husband--tell me of him. Is he quite well? Is all that fever gone, and
+
+is he strong and hearty?� I saw here an opening to ask him about
+
+Jonathan, so I said:--
+
+�He was almost recovered, but he has been greatly upset by Mr. Hawkins�s
+
+death.� He interrupted:--
+
+�Oh, yes, I know, I know. I have read your last two letters.� I went
+
+on:--
+
+�I suppose this upset him, for when we were in town on Thursday last he
+
+had a sort of shock.�
+
+�A shock, and after brain fever so soon! That was not good. What kind of
+
+a shock was it?�
+
+�He thought he saw some one who recalled something terrible, something
+
+which led to his brain fever.� And here the whole thing seemed to
+
+overwhelm me in a rush. The pity for Jonathan, the horror which he
+
+experienced, the whole fearful mystery of his diary, and the fear that
+
+has been brooding over me ever since, all came in a tumult. I suppose I
+
+was hysterical, for I threw myself on my knees and held up my hands to
+
+him, and implored him to make my husband well again. He took my hands
+
+and raised me up, and made me sit on the sofa, and sat by me; he held my
+
+hand in his, and said to me with, oh, such infinite sweetness:--
+
+�My life is a barren and lonely one, and so full of work that I have not
+
+had much time for friendships; but since I have been summoned to here by
+
+my friend John Seward I have known so many good people and seen such
+
+nobility that I feel more than ever--and it has grown with my advancing
+
+years--the loneliness of my life. Believe, me, then, that I come here
+
+full of respect for you, and you have given me hope--hope, not in what I
+
+am seeking of, but that there are good women still left to make life
+
+happy--good women, whose lives and whose truths may make good lesson for
+
+the children that are to be. I am glad, glad, that I may here be of some
+
+use to you; for if your husband suffer, he suffer within the range of my
+
+study and experience. I promise you that I will gladly do _all_ for him
+
+that I can--all to make his life strong and manly, and your life a happy
+
+one. Now you must eat. You are overwrought and perhaps over-anxious.
+
+Husband Jonathan would not like to see you so pale; and what he like not
+
+where he love, is not to his good. Therefore for his sake you must eat
+
+and smile. You have told me all about Lucy, and so now we shall not
+
+speak of it, lest it distress. I shall stay in Exeter to-night, for I
+
+want to think much over what you have told me, and when I have thought I
+
+will ask you questions, if I may. And then, too, you will tell me of
+
+husband Jonathan�s trouble so far as you can, but not yet. You must eat
+
+now; afterwards you shall tell me all.�
+
+After lunch, when we went back to the drawing-room, he said to me:--
+
+�And now tell me all about him.� When it came to speaking to this great
+
+learned man, I began to fear that he would think me a weak fool, and
+
+Jonathan a madman--that journal is all so strange--and I hesitated to go
+
+on. But he was so sweet and kind, and he had promised to help, and I
+
+trusted him, so I said:--
+
+�Dr. Van Helsing, what I have to tell you is so queer that you must not
+
+laugh at me or at my husband. I have been since yesterday in a sort of
+
+fever of doubt; you must be kind to me, and not think me foolish that I
+
+have even half believed some very strange things.� He reassured me by
+
+his manner as well as his words when he said:--
+
+�Oh, my dear, if you only know how strange is the matter regarding which
+
+I am here, it is you who would laugh. I have learned not to think little
+
+of any one�s belief, no matter how strange it be. I have tried to keep
+
+an open mind; and it is not the ordinary things of life that could close
+
+it, but the strange things, the extraordinary things, the things that
+
+make one doubt if they be mad or sane.�
+
+�Thank you, thank you, a thousand times! You have taken a weight off my
+
+mind. If you will let me, I shall give you a paper to read. It is long,
+
+but I have typewritten it out. It will tell you my trouble and
+
+Jonathan�s. It is the copy of his journal when abroad, and all that
+
+happened. I dare not say anything of it; you will read for yourself and
+
+judge. And then when I see you, perhaps, you will be very kind and tell
+
+me what you think.�
+
+�I promise,� he said as I gave him the papers; �I shall in the morning,
+
+so soon as I can, come to see you and your husband, if I may.�
+
+�Jonathan will be here at half-past eleven, and you must come to lunch
+
+with us and see him then; you could catch the quick 3:34 train, which
+
+will leave you at Paddington before eight.� He was surprised at my
+
+knowledge of the trains off-hand, but he does not know that I have made
+
+up all the trains to and from Exeter, so that I may help Jonathan in
+
+case he is in a hurry.
+
+So he took the papers with him and went away, and I sit here
+
+thinking--thinking I don�t know what.

+_Letter (by hand), Van Helsing to Mrs. Harker._
+
+�_25 September, 6 o�clock._
+
+�Dear Madam Mina,--
+
+�I have read your husband�s so wonderful diary. You may sleep without
+
+doubt. Strange and terrible as it is, it is _true_! I will pledge my
+
+life on it. It may be worse for others; but for him and you there is no
+
+dread. He is a noble fellow; and let me tell you from experience of men,
+
+that one who would do as he did in going down that wall and to that
+
+room--ay, and going a second time--is not one to be injured in
+
+permanence by a shock. His brain and his heart are all right; this I
+
+swear, before I have even seen him; so be at rest. I shall have much to
+
+ask him of other things. I am blessed that to-day I come to see you, for
+
+I have learn all at once so much that again I am dazzle--dazzle more
+
+than ever, and I must think.
+
+�Yours the most faithful,
+
+�ABRAHAM VAN HELSING.�
+
+_Letter, Mrs. Harker to Van Helsing._
+
+�_25 September, 6:30 p. m._
+
+�My dear Dr. Van Helsing,--
+
+�A thousand thanks for your kind letter, which has taken a great weight
+
+off my mind. And yet, if it be true, what terrible things there are in
+
+the world, and what an awful thing if that man, that monster, be really
+
+in London! I fear to think. I have this moment, whilst writing, had a
+
+wire from Jonathan, saying that he leaves by the 6:25 to-night from
+
+Launceston and will be here at 10:18, so that I shall have no fear
+
+to-night. Will you, therefore, instead of lunching with us, please come
+
+to breakfast at eight o�clock, if this be not too early for you? You can
+
+get away, if you are in a hurry, by the 10:30 train, which will bring
+
+you to Paddington by 2:35. Do not answer this, as I shall take it that,
+
+if I do not hear, you will come to breakfast.
+
+�Believe me,
+
+�Your faithful and grateful friend,
+
+�MINA HARKER.�
+
+_Jonathan Harker�s Journal._
+
+_26 September._--I thought never to write in this diary again, but the
+
+time has come. When I got home last night Mina had supper ready, and
+
+when we had supped she told me of Van Helsing�s visit, and of her having
+
+given him the two diaries copied out, and of how anxious she has been
+
+about me. She showed me in the doctor�s letter that all I wrote down was
+
+true. It seems to have made a new man of me. It was the doubt as to the
+
+reality of the whole thing that knocked me over. I felt impotent, and in
+
+the dark, and distrustful. But, now that I _know_, I am not afraid, even
+
+of the Count. He has succeeded after all, then, in his design in getting
+
+to London, and it was he I saw. He has got younger, and how? Van Helsing
+
+is the man to unmask him and hunt him out, if he is anything like what
+
+Mina says. We sat late, and talked it all over. Mina is dressing, and I
+
+shall call at the hotel in a few minutes and bring him over....
+
+He was, I think, surprised to see me. When I came into the room where he
+
+was, and introduced myself, he took me by the shoulder, and turned my
+
+face round to the light, and said, after a sharp scrutiny:--
+
+�But Madam Mina told me you were ill, that you had had a shock.� It was
+
+so funny to hear my wife called �Madam Mina� by this kindly,
+
+strong-faced old man. I smiled, and said:--
+
+�I _was_ ill, I _have_ had a shock; but you have cured me already.�
+
+�And how?�
+
+�By your letter to Mina last night. I was in doubt, and then everything
+
+took a hue of unreality, and I did not know what to trust, even the
+
+evidence of my own senses. Not knowing what to trust, I did not know
+
+what to do; and so had only to keep on working in what had hitherto been
+
+the groove of my life. The groove ceased to avail me, and I mistrusted
+
+myself. Doctor, you don�t know what it is to doubt everything, even
+
+yourself. No, you don�t; you couldn�t with eyebrows like yours.� He
+
+seemed pleased, and laughed as he said:--
+
+�So! You are physiognomist. I learn more here with each hour. I am with
+
+so much pleasure coming to you to breakfast; and, oh, sir, you will
+
+pardon praise from an old man, but you are blessed in your wife.� I
+
+would listen to him go on praising Mina for a day, so I simply nodded
+
+and stood silent.
+
+�She is one of God�s women, fashioned by His own hand to show us men and
+
+other women that there is a heaven where we can enter, and that its
+
+light can be here on earth. So true, so sweet, so noble, so little an
+
+egoist--and that, let me tell you, is much in this age, so sceptical and
+
+selfish. And you, sir--I have read all the letters to poor Miss Lucy,
+
+and some of them speak of you, so I know you since some days from the
+
+knowing of others; but I have seen your true self since last night. You
+
+will give me your hand, will you not? And let us be friends for all our
+
+lives.�
+
+We shook hands, and he was so earnest and so kind that it made me quite
+
+choky.
+
+�And now,� he said, �may I ask you for some more help? I have a great
+
+task to do, and at the beginning it is to know. You can help me here.
+
+Can you tell me what went before your going to Transylvania? Later on I
+
+may ask more help, and of a different kind; but at first this will do.�
+
+�Look here, sir,� I said, �does what you have to do concern the Count?�
+
+�It does,� he said solemnly.
+
+�Then I am with you heart and soul. As you go by the 10:30 train, you
+
+will not have time to read them; but I shall get the bundle of papers.
+
+You can take them with you and read them in the train.�
+
+After breakfast I saw him to the station. When we were parting he
+
+said:--
+
+�Perhaps you will come to town if I send to you, and take Madam Mina
+
+too.�
+
+�We shall both come when you will,� I said.
+
+I had got him the morning papers and the London papers of the previous
+
+night, and while we were talking at the carriage window, waiting for the
+
+train to start, he was turning them over. His eyes suddenly seemed to
+
+catch something in one of them, �The Westminster Gazette�--I knew it by
+
+the colour--and he grew quite white. He read something intently,
+
+groaning to himself: �Mein Gott! Mein Gott! So soon! so soon!� I do not
+
+think he remembered me at the moment. Just then the whistle blew, and
+
+the train moved off. This recalled him to himself, and he leaned out of
+
+the window and waved his hand, calling out: �Love to Madam Mina; I shall
+
+write so soon as ever I can.�
+
+_Dr. Seward�s Diary._
+
+_26 September._--Truly there is no such thing as finality. Not a week
+
+since I said �Finis,� and yet here I am starting fresh again, or rather
+
+going on with the same record. Until this afternoon I had no cause to
+
+think of what is done. Renfield had become, to all intents, as sane as
+
+he ever was. He was already well ahead with his fly business; and he had
+
+just started in the spider line also; so he had not been of any trouble
+
+to me. I had a letter from Arthur, written on Sunday, and from it I
+
+gather that he is bearing up wonderfully well. Quincey Morris is with
+
+him, and that is much of a help, for he himself is a bubbling well of
+
+good spirits. Quincey wrote me a line too, and from him I hear that
+
+Arthur is beginning to recover something of his old buoyancy; so as to
+
+them all my mind is at rest. As for myself, I was settling down to my
+
+work with the enthusiasm which I used to have for it, so that I might
+
+fairly have said that the wound which poor Lucy left on me was becoming
+
+cicatrised. Everything is, however, now reopened; and what is to be the
+
+end God only knows. I have an idea that Van Helsing thinks he knows,
+
+too, but he will only let out enough at a time to whet curiosity. He
+
+went to Exeter yesterday, and stayed there all night. To-day he came
+
+back, and almost bounded into the room at about half-past five o�clock,
+
+and thrust last night�s �Westminster Gazette� into my hand.
+
+�What do you think of that?� he asked as he stood back and folded his
+
+arms.
+
+I looked over the paper, for I really did not know what he meant; but he
+
+took it from me and pointed out a paragraph about children being decoyed
+
+away at Hampstead. It did not convey much to me, until I reached a
+
+passage where it described small punctured wounds on their throats. An
+
+idea struck me, and I looked up. �Well?� he said.
+
+�It is like poor Lucy�s.�
+
+�And what do you make of it?�
+
+�Simply that there is some cause in common. Whatever it was that injured
+
+her has injured them.� I did not quite understand his answer:--
+
+�That is true indirectly, but not directly.�
+
+�How do you mean, Professor?� I asked. I was a little inclined to take
+
+his seriousness lightly--for, after all, four days of rest and freedom
+
+from burning, harrowing anxiety does help to restore one�s spirits--but
+
+when I saw his face, it sobered me. Never, even in the midst of our
+
+despair about poor Lucy, had he looked more stern.
+
+�Tell me!� I said. �I can hazard no opinion. I do not know what to
+
+think, and I have no data on which to found a conjecture.�
+
+�Do you mean to tell me, friend John, that you have no suspicion as to
+
+what poor Lucy died of; not after all the hints given, not only by
+
+events, but by me?�
+
+�Of nervous prostration following on great loss or waste of blood.�
+
+�And how the blood lost or waste?� I shook my head. He stepped over and
+
+sat down beside me, and went on:--
+
+�You are clever man, friend John; you reason well, and your wit is bold;
+
+but you are too prejudiced. You do not let your eyes see nor your ears
+
+hear, and that which is outside your daily life is not of account to
+
+you. Do you not think that there are things which you cannot understand,
+
+and yet which are; that some people see things that others cannot? But
+
+there are things old and new which must not be contemplate by men�s
+
+eyes, because they know--or think they know--some things which other men
+
+have told them. Ah, it is the fault of our science that it wants to
+
+explain all; and if it explain not, then it says there is nothing to
+
+explain. But yet we see around us every day the growth of new beliefs,
+
+which think themselves new; and which are yet but the old, which pretend
+
+to be young--like the fine ladies at the opera. I suppose now you do not
+
+believe in corporeal transference. No? Nor in materialisation. No? Nor
+
+in astral bodies. No? Nor in the reading of thought. No? Nor in
+
+hypnotism----�
+
+�Yes,� I said. �Charcot has proved that pretty well.� He smiled as he
+
+went on: �Then you are satisfied as to it. Yes? And of course then you
+
+understand how it act, and can follow the mind of the great
+
+Charcot--alas that he is no more!--into the very soul of the patient
+
+that he influence. No? Then, friend John, am I to take it that you
+
+simply accept fact, and are satisfied to let from premise to conclusion
+
+be a blank? No? Then tell me--for I am student of the brain--how you
+
+accept the hypnotism and reject the thought reading. Let me tell you, my
+
+friend, that there are things done to-day in electrical science which
+
+would have been deemed unholy by the very men who discovered
+
+electricity--who would themselves not so long before have been burned
+
+as wizards. There are always mysteries in life. Why was it that
+
+Methuselah lived nine hundred years, and �Old Parr� one hundred and
+
+sixty-nine, and yet that poor Lucy, with four men�s blood in her poor
+
+veins, could not live even one day? For, had she live one more day, we
+
+could have save her. Do you know all the mystery of life and death? Do
+
+you know the altogether of comparative anatomy and can say wherefore the
+
+qualities of brutes are in some men, and not in others? Can you tell me
+
+why, when other spiders die small and soon, that one great spider lived
+
+for centuries in the tower of the old Spanish church and grew and grew,
+
+till, on descending, he could drink the oil of all the church lamps? Can
+
+you tell me why in the Pampas, ay and elsewhere, there are bats that
+
+come at night and open the veins of cattle and horses and suck dry their
+
+veins; how in some islands of the Western seas there are bats which hang
+
+on the trees all day, and those who have seen describe as like giant
+
+nuts or pods, and that when the sailors sleep on the deck, because that
+
+it is hot, flit down on them, and then--and then in the morning are
+
+found dead men, white as even Miss Lucy was?�
+
+�Good God, Professor!� I said, starting up. �Do you mean to tell me that
+
+Lucy was bitten by such a bat; and that such a thing is here in London
+
+in the nineteenth century?� He waved his hand for silence, and went
+
+on:--
+
+�Can you tell me why the tortoise lives more long than generations of
+
+men; why the elephant goes on and on till he have seen dynasties; and
+
+why the parrot never die only of bite of cat or dog or other complaint?
+
+Can you tell me why men believe in all ages and places that there are
+
+some few who live on always if they be permit; that there are men and
+
+women who cannot die? We all know--because science has vouched for the
+
+fact--that there have been toads shut up in rocks for thousands of
+
+years, shut in one so small hole that only hold him since the youth of
+
+the world. Can you tell me how the Indian fakir can make himself to die
+
+and have been buried, and his grave sealed and corn sowed on it, and the
+
+corn reaped and be cut and sown and reaped and cut again, and then men
+
+come and take away the unbroken seal and that there lie the Indian
+
+fakir, not dead, but that rise up and walk amongst them as before?� Here
+
+I interrupted him. I was getting bewildered; he so crowded on my mind
+
+his list of nature�s eccentricities and possible impossibilities that my
+
+imagination was getting fired. I had a dim idea that he was teaching me
+
+some lesson, as long ago he used to do in his study at Amsterdam; but
+
+he used then to tell me the thing, so that I could have the object of
+
+thought in mind all the time. But now I was without this help, yet I
+
+wanted to follow him, so I said:--
+
+�Professor, let me be your pet student again. Tell me the thesis, so
+
+that I may apply your knowledge as you go on. At present I am going in
+
+my mind from point to point as a mad man, and not a sane one, follows an
+
+idea. I feel like a novice lumbering through a bog in a mist, jumping
+
+from one tussock to another in the mere blind effort to move on without
+
+knowing where I am going.�
+
+�That is good image,� he said. �Well, I shall tell you. My thesis is
+
+this: I want you to believe.�
+
+�To believe what?�
+
+�To believe in things that you cannot. Let me illustrate. I heard once
+
+of an American who so defined faith: �that faculty which enables us to
+
+believe things which we know to be untrue.� For one, I follow that man.
+
+He meant that we shall have an open mind, and not let a little bit of
+
+truth check the rush of a big truth, like a small rock does a railway
+
+truck. We get the small truth first. Good! We keep him, and we value
+
+him; but all the same we must not let him think himself all the truth in
+
+the universe.�
+
+�Then you want me not to let some previous conviction injure the
+
+receptivity of my mind with regard to some strange matter. Do I read
+
+your lesson aright?�
+
+�Ah, you are my favourite pupil still. It is worth to teach you. Now
+
+that you are willing to understand, you have taken the first step to
+
+understand. You think then that those so small holes in the children�s
+
+throats were made by the same that made the hole in Miss Lucy?�
+
+�I suppose so.� He stood up and said solemnly:--
+
+�Then you are wrong. Oh, would it were so! but alas! no. It is worse,
+
+far, far worse.�
+
+�In God�s name, Professor Van Helsing, what do you mean?� I cried.
+
+He threw himself with a despairing gesture into a chair, and placed his
+
+elbows on the table, covering his face with his hands as he spoke:--
+
+�They were made by Miss Lucy!�

+CHAPTER XI
+
+_Lucy Westenra�s Diary._
+
+_12 September._--How good they all are to me. I quite love that dear Dr.
+
+Van Helsing. I wonder why he was so anxious about these flowers. He
+
+positively frightened me, he was so fierce. And yet he must have been
+
+right, for I feel comfort from them already. Somehow, I do not dread
+
+being alone to-night, and I can go to sleep without fear. I shall not
+
+mind any flapping outside the window. Oh, the terrible struggle that I
+
+have had against sleep so often of late; the pain of the sleeplessness,
+
+or the pain of the fear of sleep, with such unknown horrors as it has
+
+for me! How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, no
+
+dreads; to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and brings
+
+nothing but sweet dreams. Well, here I am to-night, hoping for sleep,
+
+and lying like Ophelia in the play, with �virgin crants and maiden
+
+strewments.� I never liked garlic before, but to-night it is delightful!
+
+There is peace in its smell; I feel sleep coming already. Good-night,
+
+everybody.
+
+_Dr. Seward�s Diary._
+
+_13 September._--Called at the Berkeley and found Van Helsing, as usual,
+
+up to time. The carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting. The
+
+Professor took his bag, which he always brings with him now.
+
+Let all be put down exactly. Van Helsing and I arrived at Hillingham at
+
+eight o�clock. It was a lovely morning; the bright sunshine and all the
+
+fresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion of nature�s
+
+annual work. The leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours,
+
+but had not yet begun to drop from the trees. When we entered we met
+
+Mrs. Westenra coming out of the morning room. She is always an early
+
+riser. She greeted us warmly and said:--
+
+�You will be glad to know that Lucy is better. The dear child is still
+
+asleep. I looked into her room and saw her, but did not go in, lest I
+
+should disturb her.� The Professor smiled, and looked quite jubilant. He
+
+rubbed his hands together, and said:--
+
+�Aha! I thought I had diagnosed the case. My treatment is working,� to
+
+which she answered:--
+
+�You must not take all the credit to yourself, doctor. Lucy�s state this
+
+morning is due in part to me.�
+
+�How you do mean, ma�am?� asked the Professor.
+
+�Well, I was anxious about the dear child in the night, and went into
+
+her room. She was sleeping soundly--so soundly that even my coming did
+
+not wake her. But the room was awfully stuffy. There were a lot of those
+
+horrible, strong-smelling flowers about everywhere, and she had actually
+
+a bunch of them round her neck. I feared that the heavy odour would be
+
+too much for the dear child in her weak state, so I took them all away
+
+and opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air. You will be
+
+pleased with her, I am sure.�
+
+She moved off into her boudoir, where she usually breakfasted early. As
+
+she had spoken, I watched the Professor�s face, and saw it turn ashen
+
+grey. He had been able to retain his self-command whilst the poor lady
+
+was present, for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would be;
+
+he actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass into
+
+her room. But the instant she had disappeared he pulled me, suddenly and
+
+forcibly, into the dining-room and closed the door.
+
+Then, for the first time in my life, I saw Van Helsing break down. He
+
+raised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair, and then beat
+
+his palms together in a helpless way; finally he sat down on a chair,
+
+and putting his hands before his face, began to sob, with loud, dry sobs
+
+that seemed to come from the very racking of his heart. Then he raised
+
+his arms again, as though appealing to the whole universe. �God! God!
+
+God!� he said. �What have we done, what has this poor thing done, that
+
+we are so sore beset? Is there fate amongst us still, sent down from the
+
+pagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way? This poor
+
+mother, all unknowing, and all for the best as she think, does such
+
+thing as lose her daughter body and soul; and we must not tell her, we
+
+must not even warn her, or she die, and then both die. Oh, how we are
+
+beset! How are all the powers of the devils against us!� Suddenly he
+
+jumped to his feet. �Come,� he said, �come, we must see and act. Devils
+
+or no devils, or all the devils at once, it matters not; we fight him
+
+all the same.� He went to the hall-door for his bag; and together we
+
+went up to Lucy�s room.
+
+Once again I drew up the blind, whilst Van Helsing went towards the bed.
+
+This time he did not start as he looked on the poor face with the same
+
+awful, waxen pallor as before. He wore a look of stern sadness and
+
+infinite pity.
+
+�As I expected,� he murmured, with that hissing inspiration of his which
+
+meant so much. Without a word he went and locked the door, and then
+
+began to set out on the little table the instruments for yet another
+
+operation of transfusion of blood. I had long ago recognised the
+
+necessity, and begun to take off my coat, but he stopped me with a
+
+warning hand. �No!� he said. �To-day you must operate. I shall provide.
+
+You are weakened already.� As he spoke he took off his coat and rolled
+
+up his shirt-sleeve.
+
+Again the operation; again the narcotic; again some return of colour to
+
+the ashy cheeks, and the regular breathing of healthy sleep. This time I
+
+watched whilst Van Helsing recruited himself and rested.
+
+Presently he took an opportunity of telling Mrs. Westenra that she must
+
+not remove anything from Lucy�s room without consulting him; that the
+
+flowers were of medicinal value, and that the breathing of their odour
+
+was a part of the system of cure. Then he took over the care of the case
+
+himself, saying that he would watch this night and the next and would
+
+send me word when to come.
+
+After another hour Lucy waked from her sleep, fresh and bright and
+
+seemingly not much the worse for her terrible ordeal.
+
+What does it all mean? I am beginning to wonder if my long habit of life
+
+amongst the insane is beginning to tell upon my own brain.
+
+_Lucy Westenra�s Diary._
+
+_17 September._--Four days and nights of peace. I am getting so strong
+
+again that I hardly know myself. It is as if I had passed through some
+
+long nightmare, and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and
+
+feel the fresh air of the morning around me. I have a dim
+
+half-remembrance of long, anxious times of waiting and fearing; darkness
+
+in which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distress
+
+more poignant: and then long spells of oblivion, and the rising back to
+
+life as a diver coming up through a great press of water. Since,
+
+however, Dr. Van Helsing has been with me, all this bad dreaming seems
+
+to have passed away; the noises that used to frighten me out of my
+
+wits--the flapping against the windows, the distant voices which seemed
+
+so close to me, the harsh sounds that came from I know not where and
+
+commanded me to do I know not what--have all ceased. I go to bed now
+
+without any fear of sleep. I do not even try to keep awake. I have grown
+
+quite fond of the garlic, and a boxful arrives for me every day from
+
+Haarlem. To-night Dr. Van Helsing is going away, as he has to be for a
+
+day in Amsterdam. But I need not be watched; I am well enough to be left
+
+alone. Thank God for mother�s sake, and dear Arthur�s, and for all our
+
+friends who have been so kind! I shall not even feel the change, for
+
+last night Dr. Van Helsing slept in his chair a lot of the time. I found
+
+him asleep twice when I awoke; but I did not fear to go to sleep again,
+
+although the boughs or bats or something napped almost angrily against
+
+the window-panes.

+_�The Pall Mall Gazette,� 18 September._
+
+THE ESCAPED WOLF.
+
+PERILOUS ADVENTURE OF OUR INTERVIEWER.
+
+_Interview with the Keeper in the Zo�logical Gardens._
+
+After many inquiries and almost as many refusals, and perpetually using
+
+the words �Pall Mall Gazette� as a sort of talisman, I managed to find
+
+the keeper of the section of the Zo�logical Gardens in which the wolf
+
+department is included. Thomas Bilder lives in one of the cottages in
+
+the enclosure behind the elephant-house, and was just sitting down to
+
+his tea when I found him. Thomas and his wife are hospitable folk,
+
+elderly, and without children, and if the specimen I enjoyed of their
+
+hospitality be of the average kind, their lives must be pretty
+
+comfortable. The keeper would not enter on what he called �business�
+
+until the supper was over, and we were all satisfied. Then when the
+
+table was cleared, and he had lit his pipe, he said:--
+
+�Now, sir, you can go on and arsk me what you want. You�ll excoose me
+
+refoosin� to talk of perfeshunal subjects afore meals. I gives the
+
+wolves and the jackals and the hyenas in all our section their tea afore
+
+I begins to arsk them questions.�
+
+�How do you mean, ask them questions?� I queried, wishful to get him
+
+into a talkative humour.
+
+��Ittin� of them over the �ead with a pole is one way; scratchin� of
+
+their hears is another, when gents as is flush wants a bit of a show-orf
+
+to their gals. I don�t so much mind the fust--the �ittin� with a pole
+
+afore I chucks in their dinner; but I waits till they�ve �ad their
+
+sherry and kawffee, so to speak, afore I tries on with the
+
+ear-scratchin�. Mind you,� he added philosophically, �there�s a deal of
+
+the same nature in us as in them theer animiles. Here�s you a-comin� and
+
+arskin� of me questions about my business, and I that grumpy-like that
+
+only for your bloomin� �arf-quid I�d �a� seen you blowed fust �fore I�d
+
+answer. Not even when you arsked me sarcastic-like if I�d like you to
+
+arsk the Superintendent if you might arsk me questions. Without offence
+
+did I tell yer to go to �ell?�
+
+�You did.�
+
+�An� when you said you�d report me for usin� of obscene language that
+
+was �ittin� me over the �ead; but the �arf-quid made that all right. I
+
+weren�t a-goin� to fight, so I waited for the food, and did with my �owl
+
+as the wolves, and lions, and tigers does. But, Lor� love yer �art, now
+
+that the old �ooman has stuck a chunk of her tea-cake in me, an� rinsed
+
+me out with her bloomin� old teapot, and I�ve lit hup, you may scratch
+
+my ears for all you�re worth, and won�t git even a growl out of me.
+
+Drive along with your questions. I know what yer a-comin� at, that �ere
+
+escaped wolf.�
+
+�Exactly. I want you to give me your view of it. Just tell me how it
+
+happened; and when I know the facts I�ll get you to say what you
+
+consider was the cause of it, and how you think the whole affair will
+
+end.�
+
+�All right, guv�nor. This �ere is about the �ole story. That �ere wolf
+
+what we called Bersicker was one of three grey ones that came from
+
+Norway to Jamrach�s, which we bought off him four years ago. He was a
+
+nice well-behaved wolf, that never gave no trouble to talk of. I�m more
+
+surprised at �im for wantin� to get out nor any other animile in the
+
+place. But, there, you can�t trust wolves no more nor women.�
+
+�Don�t you mind him, sir!� broke in Mrs. Tom, with a cheery laugh. ��E�s
+
+got mindin� the animiles so long that blest if he ain�t like a old wolf
+
+�isself! But there ain�t no �arm in �im.�
+
+�Well, sir, it was about two hours after feedin� yesterday when I first
+
+hear my disturbance. I was makin� up a litter in the monkey-house for a
+
+young puma which is ill; but when I heard the yelpin� and �owlin� I kem
+
+away straight. There was Bersicker a-tearin� like a mad thing at the
+
+bars as if he wanted to get out. There wasn�t much people about that
+
+day, and close at hand was only one man, a tall, thin chap, with a �ook
+
+nose and a pointed beard, with a few white hairs runnin� through it. He
+
+had a �ard, cold look and red eyes, and I took a sort of mislike to him,
+
+for it seemed as if it was �im as they was hirritated at. He �ad white
+
+kid gloves on �is �ands, and he pointed out the animiles to me and says:
+
+�Keeper, these wolves seem upset at something.�
+
+��Maybe it�s you,� says I, for I did not like the airs as he give
+
+�isself. He didn�t git angry, as I �oped he would, but he smiled a kind
+
+of insolent smile, with a mouth full of white, sharp teeth. �Oh no, they
+
+wouldn�t like me,� �e says.
+
+��Ow yes, they would,� says I, a-imitatin� of him. �They always likes a
+
+bone or two to clean their teeth on about tea-time, which you �as a
+
+bagful.�
+
+�Well, it was a odd thing, but when the animiles see us a-talkin� they
+
+lay down, and when I went over to Bersicker he let me stroke his ears
+
+same as ever. That there man kem over, and blessed but if he didn�t put
+
+in his hand and stroke the old wolf�s ears too!
+
+��Tyke care,� says I. �Bersicker is quick.�
+
+��Never mind,� he says. �I�m used to �em!�
+
+��Are you in the business yourself?� I says, tyking off my �at, for a
+
+man what trades in wolves, anceterer, is a good friend to keepers.
+
+��No,� says he, �not exactly in the business, but I �ave made pets of
+
+several.� And with that he lifts his �at as perlite as a lord, and walks
+
+away. Old Bersicker kep� a-lookin� arter �im till �e was out of sight,
+
+and then went and lay down in a corner and wouldn�t come hout the �ole
+
+hevening. Well, larst night, so soon as the moon was hup, the wolves
+
+here all began a-�owling. There warn�t nothing for them to �owl at.
+
+There warn�t no one near, except some one that was evidently a-callin� a
+
+dog somewheres out back of the gardings in the Park road. Once or twice
+
+I went out to see that all was right, and it was, and then the �owling
+
+stopped. Just before twelve o�clock I just took a look round afore
+
+turnin� in, an�, bust me, but when I kem opposite to old Bersicker�s
+
+cage I see the rails broken and twisted about and the cage empty. And
+
+that�s all I know for certing.�
+
+�Did any one else see anything?�
+
+�One of our gard�ners was a-comin� �ome about that time from a �armony,
+
+when he sees a big grey dog comin� out through the garding �edges. At
+
+least, so he says, but I don�t give much for it myself, for if he did �e
+
+never said a word about it to his missis when �e got �ome, and it was
+
+only after the escape of the wolf was made known, and we had been up all
+
+night-a-huntin� of the Park for Bersicker, that he remembered seein�
+
+anything. My own belief was that the �armony �ad got into his �ead.�
+
+�Now, Mr. Bilder, can you account in any way for the escape of the
+
+wolf?�
+
+�Well, sir,� he said, with a suspicious sort of modesty, �I think I can;
+
+but I don�t know as �ow you�d be satisfied with the theory.�
+
+�Certainly I shall. If a man like you, who knows the animals from
+
+experience, can�t hazard a good guess at any rate, who is even to try?�
+
+�Well then, sir, I accounts for it this way; it seems to me that �ere
+
+wolf escaped--simply because he wanted to get out.�
+
+From the hearty way that both Thomas and his wife laughed at the joke I
+
+could see that it had done service before, and that the whole
+
+explanation was simply an elaborate sell. I couldn�t cope in badinage
+
+with the worthy Thomas, but I thought I knew a surer way to his heart,
+
+so I said:--
+
+�Now, Mr. Bilder, we�ll consider that first half-sovereign worked off,
+
+and this brother of his is waiting to be claimed when you�ve told me
+
+what you think will happen.�
+
+�Right y�are, sir,� he said briskly. �Ye�ll excoose me, I know, for
+
+a-chaffin� of ye, but the old woman here winked at me, which was as much
+
+as telling me to go on.�
+
+�Well, I never!� said the old lady.
+
+�My opinion is this: that �ere wolf is a-�idin� of, somewheres. The
+
+gard�ner wot didn�t remember said he was a-gallopin� northward faster
+
+than a horse could go; but I don�t believe him, for, yer see, sir,
+
+wolves don�t gallop no more nor dogs does, they not bein� built that
+
+way. Wolves is fine things in a storybook, and I dessay when they gets
+
+in packs and does be chivyin� somethin� that�s more afeared than they is
+
+they can make a devil of a noise and chop it up, whatever it is. But,
+
+Lor� bless you, in real life a wolf is only a low creature, not half so
+
+clever or bold as a good dog; and not half a quarter so much fight in
+
+�im. This one ain�t been used to fightin� or even to providin� for
+
+hisself, and more like he�s somewhere round the Park a-�idin� an�
+
+a-shiverin� of, and, if he thinks at all, wonderin� where he is to get
+
+his breakfast from; or maybe he�s got down some area and is in a
+
+coal-cellar. My eye, won�t some cook get a rum start when she sees his
+
+green eyes a-shining at her out of the dark! If he can�t get food he�s
+
+bound to look for it, and mayhap he may chance to light on a butcher�s
+
+shop in time. If he doesn�t, and some nursemaid goes a-walkin� orf with
+
+a soldier, leavin� of the hinfant in the perambulator--well, then I
+
+shouldn�t be surprised if the census is one babby the less. That�s
+
+all.�
+
+I was handing him the half-sovereign, when something came bobbing up
+
+against the window, and Mr. Bilder�s face doubled its natural length
+
+with surprise.
+
+�God bless me!� he said. �If there ain�t old Bersicker come back by
+
+�isself!�
+
+He went to the door and opened it; a most unnecessary proceeding it
+
+seemed to me. I have always thought that a wild animal never looks so
+
+well as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between us; a
+
+personal experience has intensified rather than diminished that idea.
+
+After all, however, there is nothing like custom, for neither Bilder nor
+
+his wife thought any more of the wolf than I should of a dog. The animal
+
+itself was as peaceful and well-behaved as that father of all
+
+picture-wolves--Red Riding Hood�s quondam friend, whilst moving her
+
+confidence in masquerade.
+
+The whole scene was an unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos. The
+
+wicked wolf that for half a day had paralysed London and set all the
+
+children in the town shivering in their shoes, was there in a sort of
+
+penitent mood, and was received and petted like a sort of vulpine
+
+prodigal son. Old Bilder examined him all over with most tender
+
+solicitude, and when he had finished with his penitent said:--
+
+�There, I knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of trouble;
+
+didn�t I say it all along? Here�s his head all cut and full of broken
+
+glass. �E�s been a-gettin� over some bloomin� wall or other. It�s a
+
+shyme that people are allowed to top their walls with broken bottles.
+
+This �ere�s what comes of it. Come along, Bersicker.�
+
+He took the wolf and locked him up in a cage, with a piece of meat that
+
+satisfied, in quantity at any rate, the elementary conditions of the
+
+fatted calf, and went off to report.
+
+I came off, too, to report the only exclusive information that is given
+
+to-day regarding the strange escapade at the Zoo.
+
+_Dr. Seward�s Diary._
+
+_17 September._--I was engaged after dinner in my study posting up my
+
+books, which, through press of other work and the many visits to Lucy,
+
+had fallen sadly into arrear. Suddenly the door was burst open, and in
+
+rushed my patient, with his face distorted with passion. I was
+
+thunderstruck, for such a thing as a patient getting of his own accord
+
+into the Superintendent�s study is almost unknown. Without an instant�s
+
+pause he made straight at me. He had a dinner-knife in his hand, and,
+
+as I saw he was dangerous, I tried to keep the table between us. He was
+
+too quick and too strong for me, however; for before I could get my
+
+balance he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely.
+
+Before he could strike again, however, I got in my right and he was
+
+sprawling on his back on the floor. My wrist bled freely, and quite a
+
+little pool trickled on to the carpet. I saw that my friend was not
+
+intent on further effort, and occupied myself binding up my wrist,
+
+keeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time. When the
+
+attendants rushed in, and we turned our attention to him, his employment
+
+positively sickened me. He was lying on his belly on the floor licking
+
+up, like a dog, the blood which had fallen from my wounded wrist. He was
+
+easily secured, and, to my surprise, went with the attendants quite
+
+placidly, simply repeating over and over again: �The blood is the life!
+
+The blood is the life!�
+
+I cannot afford to lose blood just at present; I have lost too much of
+
+late for my physical good, and then the prolonged strain of Lucy�s
+
+illness and its horrible phases is telling on me. I am over-excited and
+
+weary, and I need rest, rest, rest. Happily Van Helsing has not summoned
+
+me, so I need not forego my sleep; to-night I could not well do without
+
+it.

+
+possible that all may be well, but what _may_ have happened? Surely
+
+there is some horrible doom hanging over us that every possible accident
+
+should thwart us in all we try to do. I shall take this cylinder with

+me, and then I can complete my entry on Lucy�s phonograph.
+
+_Memorandum left by Lucy Westenra._
+
+_17 September. Night._--I write this and leave it to be seen, so that no
+
+one may by any chance get into trouble through me. This is an exact
+
+record of what took place to-night. I feel I am dying of weakness, and
+
+have barely strength to write, but it must be done if I die in the
+
+doing.
+
+I went to bed as usual, taking care that the flowers were placed as Dr.
+
+Van Helsing directed, and soon fell asleep.
+
+I was waked by the flapping at the window, which had begun after that
+
+sleep-walking on the cliff at Whitby when Mina saved me, and which now I
+
+know so well. I was not afraid, but I did wish that Dr. Seward was in
+
+the next room--as Dr. Van Helsing said he would be--so that I might have
+
+called him. I tried to go to sleep, but could not. Then there came to me
+
+the old fear of sleep, and I determined to keep awake. Perversely sleep
+
+would try to come then when I did not want it; so, as I feared to be
+
+alone, I opened my door and called out: �Is there anybody there?� There
+
+was no answer. I was afraid to wake mother, and so closed my door again.
+
+Then outside in the shrubbery I heard a sort of howl like a dog�s, but
+
+more fierce and deeper. I went to the window and looked out, but could
+
+see nothing, except a big bat, which had evidently been buffeting its
+
+wings against the window. So I went back to bed again, but determined
+
+not to go to sleep. Presently the door opened, and mother looked in;
+
+seeing by my moving that I was not asleep, came in, and sat by me. She
+
+said to me even more sweetly and softly than her wont:--
+
+�I was uneasy about you, darling, and came in to see that you were all
+
+right.�
+
+I feared she might catch cold sitting there, and asked her to come in
+
+and sleep with me, so she came into bed, and lay down beside me; she did
+
+not take off her dressing gown, for she said she would only stay a while
+
+and then go back to her own bed. As she lay there in my arms, and I in
+
+hers, the flapping and buffeting came to the window again. She was
+
+startled and a little frightened, and cried out: �What is that?� I tried
+
+to pacify her, and at last succeeded, and she lay quiet; but I could
+
+hear her poor dear heart still beating terribly. After a while there was
+
+the low howl again out in the shrubbery, and shortly after there was a
+
+crash at the window, and a lot of broken glass was hurled on the floor.
+
+The window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in, and in the
+
+aperture of the broken panes there was the head of a great, gaunt grey
+
+wolf. Mother cried out in a fright, and struggled up into a sitting
+
+posture, and clutched wildly at anything that would help her. Amongst
+
+other things, she clutched the wreath of flowers that Dr. Van Helsing
+
+insisted on my wearing round my neck, and tore it away from me. For a
+
+second or two she sat up, pointing at the wolf, and there was a strange
+
+and horrible gurgling in her throat; then she fell over--as if struck
+
+with lightning, and her head hit my forehead and made me dizzy for a
+
+moment or two. The room and all round seemed to spin round. I kept my
+
+eyes fixed on the window, but the wolf drew his head back, and a whole
+
+myriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the broken
+
+window, and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust that
+
+travellers describe when there is a simoon in the desert. I tried to
+
+stir, but there was some spell upon me, and dear mother�s poor body,
+
+which seemed to grow cold already--for her dear heart had ceased to
+
+beat--weighed me down; and I remembered no more for a while.
+
+The time did not seem long, but very, very awful, till I recovered
+
+consciousness again. Somewhere near, a passing bell was tolling; the
+
+dogs all round the neighbourhood were howling; and in our shrubbery,
+
+seemingly just outside, a nightingale was singing. I was dazed and
+
+stupid with pain and terror and weakness, but the sound of the
+
+nightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfort
+
+me. The sounds seemed to have awakened the maids, too, for I could hear
+
+their bare feet pattering outside my door. I called to them, and they
+
+came in, and when they saw what had happened, and what it was that lay
+
+over me on the bed, they screamed out. The wind rushed in through the
+
+broken window, and the door slammed to. They lifted off the body of my
+
+dear mother, and laid her, covered up with a sheet, on the bed after I
+
+had got up. They were all so frightened and nervous that I directed them
+
+to go to the dining-room and have each a glass of wine. The door flew
+
+open for an instant and closed again. The maids shrieked, and then went
+
+in a body to the dining-room; and I laid what flowers I had on my dear
+
+mother�s breast. When they were there I remembered what Dr. Van Helsing
+
+had told me, but I didn�t like to remove them, and, besides, I would
+
+have some of the servants to sit up with me now. I was surprised that
+
+the maids did not come back. I called them, but got no answer, so I went
+
+to the dining-room to look for them.
+
+My heart sank when I saw what had happened. They all four lay helpless
+
+on the floor, breathing heavily. The decanter of sherry was on the table
+
+half full, but there was a queer, acrid smell about. I was suspicious,
+
+and examined the decanter. It smelt of laudanum, and looking on the
+
+sideboard, I found that the bottle which mother�s doctor uses for
+
+her--oh! did use--was empty. What am I to do? what am I to do? I am back
+
+in the room with mother. I cannot leave her, and I am alone, save for
+
+the sleeping servants, whom some one has drugged. Alone with the dead! I
+
+dare not go out, for I can hear the low howl of the wolf through the
+
+broken window.
+
+The air seems full of specks, floating and circling in the draught from
+
+the window, and the lights burn blue and dim. What am I to do? God
+
+shield me from harm this night! I shall hide this paper in my breast,
+
+where they shall find it when they come to lay me out. My dear mother
+
+gone! It is time that I go too. Good-bye, dear Arthur, if I should not

+survive this night. God keep you, dear, and God help me!

+CHAPTER XVI
+
+DR. SEWARD�S DIARY--_continued_
+
+It was just a quarter before twelve o�clock when we got into the
+
+churchyard over the low wall. The night was dark with occasional gleams
+
+of moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that scudded across
+
+the sky. We all kept somehow close together, with Van Helsing slightly
+
+in front as he led the way. When we had come close to the tomb I looked
+
+well at Arthur, for I feared that the proximity to a place laden with so
+
+sorrowful a memory would upset him; but he bore himself well. I took it
+
+that the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way a counteractant
+
+to his grief. The Professor unlocked the door, and seeing a natural
+
+hesitation amongst us for various reasons, solved the difficulty by
+
+entering first himself. The rest of us followed, and he closed the door.
+
+He then lit a dark lantern and pointed to the coffin. Arthur stepped
+
+forward hesitatingly; Van Helsing said to me:--
+
+�You were with me here yesterday. Was the body of Miss Lucy in that
+
+coffin?�
+
+�It was.� The Professor turned to the rest saying:--
+
+�You hear; and yet there is no one who does not believe with me.� He
+
+took his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin. Arthur
+
+looked on, very pale but silent; when the lid was removed he stepped
+
+forward. He evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin, or,
+
+at any rate, had not thought of it. When he saw the rent in the lead,
+
+the blood rushed to his face for an instant, but as quickly fell away
+
+again, so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness; he was still silent.
+
+Van Helsing forced back the leaden flange, and we all looked in and
+
+recoiled.
+
+The coffin was empty!
+
+For several minutes no one spoke a word. The silence was broken by
+
+Quincey Morris:--
+
+�Professor, I answered for you. Your word is all I want. I wouldn�t ask
+
+such a thing ordinarily--I wouldn�t so dishonour you as to imply a
+
+doubt; but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour.
+
+Is this your doing?�
+
+�I swear to you by all that I hold sacred that I have not removed nor
+
+touched her. What happened was this: Two nights ago my friend Seward and
+
+I came here--with good purpose, believe me. I opened that coffin, which
+
+was then sealed up, and we found it, as now, empty. We then waited, and
+
+saw something white come through the trees. The next day we came here in
+
+day-time, and she lay there. Did she not, friend John?�
+
+�Yes.�
+
+�That night we were just in time. One more so small child was missing,
+
+and we find it, thank God, unharmed amongst the graves. Yesterday I came
+
+here before sundown, for at sundown the Un-Dead can move. I waited here
+
+all the night till the sun rose, but I saw nothing. It was most probable
+
+that it was because I had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic,
+
+which the Un-Dead cannot bear, and other things which they shun. Last
+
+night there was no exodus, so to-night before the sundown I took away my
+
+garlic and other things. And so it is we find this coffin empty. But
+
+bear with me. So far there is much that is strange. Wait you with me
+
+outside, unseen and unheard, and things much stranger are yet to be.
+
+So�--here he shut the dark slide of his lantern--�now to the outside.�
+
+He opened the door, and we filed out, he coming last and locking the
+
+door behind him.
+
+Oh! but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of
+
+that vault. How sweet it was to see the clouds race by, and the passing
+
+gleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing and
+
+passing--like the gladness and sorrow of a man�s life; how sweet it was
+
+to breathe the fresh air, that had no taint of death and decay; how
+
+humanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill, and to
+
+hear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a great city. Each
+
+in his own way was solemn and overcome. Arthur was silent, and was, I
+
+could see, striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of the
+
+mystery. I was myself tolerably patient, and half inclined again to
+
+throw aside doubt and to accept Van Helsing�s conclusions. Quincey
+
+Morris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things, and
+
+accepts them in the spirit of cool bravery, with hazard of all he has to
+
+stake. Not being able to smoke, he cut himself a good-sized plug of
+
+tobacco and began to chew. As to Van Helsing, he was employed in a
+
+definite way. First he took from his bag a mass of what looked like
+
+thin, wafer-like biscuit, which was carefully rolled up in a white
+
+napkin; next he took out a double-handful of some whitish stuff, like
+
+dough or putty. He crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into the
+
+mass between his hands. This he then took, and rolling it into thin
+
+strips, began to lay them into the crevices between the door and its
+
+setting in the tomb. I was somewhat puzzled at this, and being close,
+
+asked him what it was that he was doing. Arthur and Quincey drew near
+
+also, as they too were curious. He answered:--
+
+�I am closing the tomb, so that the Un-Dead may not enter.�
+
+�And is that stuff you have put there going to do it?� asked Quincey.
+
+�Great Scott! Is this a game?�
+
+�It is.�
+
+�What is that which you are using?� This time the question was by
+
+Arthur. Van Helsing reverently lifted his hat as he answered:--
+
+�The Host. I brought it from Amsterdam. I have an Indulgence.� It was an
+
+answer that appalled the most sceptical of us, and we felt individually
+
+that in the presence of such earnest purpose as the Professor�s, a
+
+purpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of things, it was
+
+impossible to distrust. In respectful silence we took the places
+
+assigned to us close round the tomb, but hidden from the sight of any
+
+one approaching. I pitied the others, especially Arthur. I had myself
+
+been apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror; and yet I,
+
+who had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs, felt my heart sink
+
+within me. Never did tombs look so ghastly white; never did cypress, or
+
+yew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of funereal gloom; never did tree
+
+or grass wave or rustle so ominously; never did bough creak so
+
+mysteriously; and never did the far-away howling of dogs send such a
+
+woeful presage through the night.
+
+There was a long spell of silence, a big, aching void, and then from the
+
+Professor a keen �S-s-s-s!� He pointed; and far down the avenue of yews
+
+we saw a white figure advance--a dim white figure, which held something
+
+dark at its breast. The figure stopped, and at the moment a ray of
+
+moonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds and showed in startling
+
+prominence a dark-haired woman, dressed in the cerements of the grave.
+
+We could not see the face, for it was bent down over what we saw to be a
+
+fair-haired child. There was a pause and a sharp little cry, such as a
+
+child gives in sleep, or a dog as it lies before the fire and dreams. We
+
+were starting forward, but the Professor�s warning hand, seen by us as
+
+he stood behind a yew-tree, kept us back; and then as we looked the
+
+white figure moved forwards again. It was now near enough for us to see
+
+clearly, and the moonlight still held. My own heart grew cold as ice,
+
+and I could hear the gasp of Arthur, as we recognised the features of
+
+Lucy Westenra. Lucy Westenra, but yet how changed. The sweetness was
+
+turned to adamantine, heartless cruelty, and the purity to voluptuous
+
+wantonness. Van Helsing stepped out, and, obedient to his gesture, we
+
+all advanced too; the four of us ranged in a line before the door of the
+
+tomb. Van Helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide; by the
+
+concentrated light that fell on Lucy�s face we could see that the lips
+
+were crimson with fresh blood, and that the stream had trickled over her
+
+chin and stained the purity of her lawn death-robe.
+
+We shuddered with horror. I could see by the tremulous light that even
+
+Van Helsing�s iron nerve had failed. Arthur was next to me, and if I had
+
+not seized his arm and held him up, he would have fallen.
+
+When Lucy--I call the thing that was before us Lucy because it bore her
+
+shape--saw us she drew back with an angry snarl, such as a cat gives
+
+when taken unawares; then her eyes ranged over us. Lucy�s eyes in form
+
+and colour; but Lucy�s eyes unclean and full of hell-fire, instead of
+
+the pure, gentle orbs we knew. At that moment the remnant of my love
+
+passed into hate and loathing; had she then to be killed, I could have
+
+done it with savage delight. As she looked, her eyes blazed with unholy
+
+light, and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile. Oh, God,
+
+how it made me shudder to see it! With a careless motion, she flung to
+
+the ground, callous as a devil, the child that up to now she had
+
+clutched strenuously to her breast, growling over it as a dog growls
+
+over a bone. The child gave a sharp cry, and lay there moaning. There
+
+was a cold-bloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from Arthur; when
+
+she advanced to him with outstretched arms and a wanton smile he fell
+
+back and hid his face in his hands.
+
+She still advanced, however, and with a languorous, voluptuous grace,
+
+said:--
+
+�Come to me, Arthur. Leave these others and come to me. My arms are
+
+hungry for you. Come, and we can rest together. Come, my husband, come!�
+
+There was something diabolically sweet in her tones--something of the
+
+tingling of glass when struck--which rang through the brains even of us
+
+who heard the words addressed to another. As for Arthur, he seemed under
+
+a spell; moving his hands from his face, he opened wide his arms. She
+
+was leaping for them, when Van Helsing sprang forward and held between
+
+them his little golden crucifix. She recoiled from it, and, with a
+
+suddenly distorted face, full of rage, dashed past him as if to enter
+
+the tomb.
+
+When within a foot or two of the door, however, she stopped, as if
+
+arrested by some irresistible force. Then she turned, and her face was
+
+shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp, which had now no
+
+quiver from Van Helsing�s iron nerves. Never did I see such baffled
+
+malice on a face; and never, I trust, shall such ever be seen again by
+
+mortal eyes. The beautiful colour became livid, the eyes seemed to throw
+
+out sparks of hell-fire, the brows were wrinkled as though the folds of
+
+the flesh were the coils of Medusa�s snakes, and the lovely,
+
+blood-stained mouth grew to an open square, as in the passion masks of
+
+the Greeks and Japanese. If ever a face meant death--if looks could
+
+kill--we saw it at that moment.
+
+And so for full half a minute, which seemed an eternity, she remained
+
+between the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of her means of
+
+entry. Van Helsing broke the silence by asking Arthur:--
+
+�Answer me, oh my friend! Am I to proceed in my work?�
+
+Arthur threw himself on his knees, and hid his face in his hands, as he
+
+answered:--
+
+�Do as you will, friend; do as you will. There can be no horror like
+
+this ever any more;� and he groaned in spirit. Quincey and I
+
+simultaneously moved towards him, and took his arms. We could hear the
+
+click of the closing lantern as Van Helsing held it down; coming close
+
+to the tomb, he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred
+
+emblem which he had placed there. We all looked on in horrified
+
+amazement as we saw, when he stood back, the woman, with a corporeal
+
+body as real at that moment as our own, pass in through the interstice
+
+where scarce a knife-blade could have gone. We all felt a glad sense of
+
+relief when we saw the Professor calmly restoring the strings of putty
+
+to the edges of the door.
+
+When this was done, he lifted the child and said:
+
+�Come now, my friends; we can do no more till to-morrow. There is a
+
+funeral at noon, so here we shall all come before long after that. The
+
+friends of the dead will all be gone by two, and when the sexton lock
+
+the gate we shall remain. Then there is more to do; but not like this of
+
+to-night. As for this little one, he is not much harm, and by to-morrow
+
+night he shall be well. We shall leave him where the police will find
+
+him, as on the other night; and then to home.� Coming close to Arthur,
+
+he said:--
+
+�My friend Arthur, you have had a sore trial; but after, when you look
+
+back, you will see how it was necessary. You are now in the bitter
+
+waters, my child. By this time to-morrow you will, please God, have
+
+passed them, and have drunk of the sweet waters; so do not mourn
+
+overmuch. Till then I shall not ask you to forgive me.�
+
+Arthur and Quincey came home with me, and we tried to cheer each other
+
+on the way. We had left the child in safety, and were tired; so we all
+
+slept with more or less reality of sleep.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_29 September, night._--A little before twelve o�clock we three--Arthur,
+
+Quincey Morris, and myself--called for the Professor. It was odd to
+
+notice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes. Of
+
+course, Arthur wore black, for he was in deep mourning, but the rest of
+
+us wore it by instinct. We got to the churchyard by half-past one, and
+
+strolled about, keeping out of official observation, so that when the
+
+gravediggers had completed their task and the sexton under the belief
+
+that every one had gone, had locked the gate, we had the place all to
+
+ourselves. Van Helsing, instead of his little black bag, had with him a
+
+long leather one, something like a cricketing bag; it was manifestly of
+
+fair weight.
+
+When we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out up
+
+the road, we silently, and as if by ordered intention, followed the
+
+Professor to the tomb. He unlocked the door, and we entered, closing it
+
+behind us. Then he took from his bag the lantern, which he lit, and also
+
+two wax candles, which, when lighted, he stuck, by melting their own
+
+ends, on other coffins, so that they might give light sufficient to work
+
+by. When he again lifted the lid off Lucy�s coffin we all looked--Arthur
+
+trembling like an aspen--and saw that the body lay there in all its
+
+death-beauty. But there was no love in my own heart, nothing but
+
+loathing for the foul Thing which had taken Lucy�s shape without her
+
+soul. I could see even Arthur�s face grow hard as he looked. Presently
+
+he said to Van Helsing:--
+
+�Is this really Lucy�s body, or only a demon in her shape?�
+
+�It is her body, and yet not it. But wait a while, and you all see her
+
+as she was, and is.�
+
+She seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there; the pointed teeth,
+
+the bloodstained, voluptuous mouth--which it made one shudder to
+
+see--the whole carnal and unspiritual appearance, seeming like a
+
+devilish mockery of Lucy�s sweet purity. Van Helsing, with his usual
+
+methodicalness, began taking the various contents from his bag and
+
+placing them ready for use. First he took out a soldering iron and some
+
+plumbing solder, and then a small oil-lamp, which gave out, when lit in
+
+a corner of the tomb, gas which burned at fierce heat with a blue
+
+flame; then his operating knives, which he placed to hand; and last a
+
+round wooden stake, some two and a half or three inches thick and about
+
+three feet long. One end of it was hardened by charring in the fire, and
+
+was sharpened to a fine point. With this stake came a heavy hammer, such
+
+as in households is used in the coal-cellar for breaking the lumps. To
+
+me, a doctor�s preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and
+
+bracing, but the effect of these things on both Arthur and Quincey was
+
+to cause them a sort of consternation. They both, however, kept their
+
+courage, and remained silent and quiet.
+
+When all was ready, Van Helsing said:--
+
+�Before we do anything, let me tell you this; it is out of the lore and
+
+experience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powers
+
+of the Un-Dead. When they become such, there comes with the change the
+
+curse of immortality; they cannot die, but must go on age after age
+
+adding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world; for all that
+
+die from the preying of the Un-Dead becomes themselves Un-Dead, and prey
+
+on their kind. And so the circle goes on ever widening, like as the
+
+ripples from a stone thrown in the water. Friend Arthur, if you had met
+
+that kiss which you know of before poor Lucy die; or again, last night
+
+when you open your arms to her, you would in time, when you had died,
+
+have become _nosferatu_, as they call it in Eastern Europe, and would
+
+all time make more of those Un-Deads that so have fill us with horror.
+
+The career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun. Those
+
+children whose blood she suck are not as yet so much the worse; but if
+
+she live on, Un-Dead, more and more they lose their blood and by her
+
+power over them they come to her; and so she draw their blood with that
+
+so wicked mouth. But if she die in truth, then all cease; the tiny
+
+wounds of the throats disappear, and they go back to their plays
+
+unknowing ever of what has been. But of the most blessed of all, when
+
+this now Un-Dead be made to rest as true dead, then the soul of the poor
+
+lady whom we love shall again be free. Instead of working wickedness by
+
+night and growing more debased in the assimilating of it by day, she
+
+shall take her place with the other Angels. So that, my friend, it will
+
+be a blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free.
+
+To this I am willing; but is there none amongst us who has a better
+
+right? Will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the
+
+night when sleep is not: �It was my hand that sent her to the stars; it
+
+was the hand of him that loved her best; the hand that of all she would
+
+herself have chosen, had it been to her to choose?� Tell me if there be
+
+such a one amongst us?�
+
+We all looked at Arthur. He saw, too, what we all did, the infinite
+
+kindness which suggested that his should be the hand which would restore
+
+Lucy to us as a holy, and not an unholy, memory; he stepped forward and
+
+said bravely, though his hand trembled, and his face was as pale as
+
+snow:--
+
+�My true friend, from the bottom of my broken heart I thank you. Tell me
+
+what I am to do, and I shall not falter!� Van Helsing laid a hand on his
+
+shoulder, and said:--
+
+�Brave lad! A moment�s courage, and it is done. This stake must be
+
+driven through her. It will be a fearful ordeal--be not deceived in
+
+that--but it will be only a short time, and you will then rejoice more
+
+than your pain was great; from this grim tomb you will emerge as though
+
+you tread on air. But you must not falter when once you have begun. Only
+
+think that we, your true friends, are round you, and that we pray for
+
+you all the time.�
+
+�Go on,� said Arthur hoarsely. �Tell me what I am to do.�
+
+�Take this stake in your left hand, ready to place the point over the
+
+heart, and the hammer in your right. Then when we begin our prayer for
+
+the dead--I shall read him, I have here the book, and the others shall
+
+follow--strike in God�s name, that so all may be well with the dead that
+
+we love and that the Un-Dead pass away.�
+
+Arthur took the stake and the hammer, and when once his mind was set on
+
+action his hands never trembled nor even quivered. Van Helsing opened
+
+his missal and began to read, and Quincey and I followed as well as we
+
+could. Arthur placed the point over the heart, and as I looked I could
+
+see its dint in the white flesh. Then he struck with all his might.
+
+The Thing in the coffin writhed; and a hideous, blood-curdling screech
+
+came from the opened red lips. The body shook and quivered and twisted
+
+in wild contortions; the sharp white teeth champed together till the
+
+lips were cut, and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam. But Arthur
+
+never faltered. He looked like a figure of Thor as his untrembling arm
+
+rose and fell, driving deeper and deeper the mercy-bearing stake, whilst
+
+the blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it. His
+
+face was set, and high duty seemed to shine through it; the sight of it
+
+gave us courage so that our voices seemed to ring through the little
+
+vault.
+
+And then the writhing and quivering of the body became less, and the
+
+teeth seemed to champ, and the face to quiver. Finally it lay still. The
+
+terrible task was over.
+
+The hammer fell from Arthur�s hand. He reeled and would have fallen had
+
+we not caught him. The great drops of sweat sprang from his forehead,
+
+and his breath came in broken gasps. It had indeed been an awful strain
+
+on him; and had he not been forced to his task by more than human
+
+considerations he could never have gone through with it. For a few
+
+minutes we were so taken up with him that we did not look towards the
+
+coffin. When we did, however, a murmur of startled surprise ran from one
+
+to the other of us. We gazed so eagerly that Arthur rose, for he had
+
+been seated on the ground, and came and looked too; and then a glad,
+
+strange light broke over his face and dispelled altogether the gloom of
+
+horror that lay upon it.
+
+There, in the coffin lay no longer the foul Thing that we had so dreaded
+
+and grown to hate that the work of her destruction was yielded as a
+
+privilege to the one best entitled to it, but Lucy as we had seen her in
+
+her life, with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity. True that
+
+there were there, as we had seen them in life, the traces of care and
+
+pain and waste; but these were all dear to us, for they marked her truth
+
+to what we knew. One and all we felt that the holy calm that lay like
+
+sunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token and
+
+symbol of the calm that was to reign for ever.
+
+Van Helsing came and laid his hand on Arthur�s shoulder, and said to
+
+him:--
+
+�And now, Arthur my friend, dear lad, am I not forgiven?�
+
+The reaction of the terrible strain came as he took the old man�s hand
+
+in his, and raising it to his lips, pressed it, and said:--
+
+�Forgiven! God bless you that you have given my dear one her soul again,
+
+and me peace.� He put his hands on the Professor�s shoulder, and laying
+
+his head on his breast, cried for a while silently, whilst we stood
+
+unmoving. When he raised his head Van Helsing said to him:--
+
+�And now, my child, you may kiss her. Kiss her dead lips if you will, as
+
+she would have you to, if for her to choose. For she is not a grinning
+
+devil now--not any more a foul Thing for all eternity. No longer she is
+
+the devil�s Un-Dead. She is God�s true dead, whose soul is with Him!�
+
+Arthur bent and kissed her, and then we sent him and Quincey out of the
+
+tomb; the Professor and I sawed the top off the stake, leaving the point
+
+of it in the body. Then we cut off the head and filled the mouth with
+
+garlic. We soldered up the leaden coffin, screwed on the coffin-lid,
+
+and gathering up our belongings, came away. When the Professor locked
+
+the door he gave the key to Arthur.
+
+Outside the air was sweet, the sun shone, and the birds sang, and it
+
+seemed as if all nature were tuned to a different pitch. There was
+
+gladness and mirth and peace everywhere, for we were at rest ourselves
+
+on one account, and we were glad, though it was with a tempered joy.
+
+Before we moved away Van Helsing said:--
+
+�Now, my friends, one step of our work is done, one the most harrowing
+
+to ourselves. But there remains a greater task: to find out the author
+
+of all this our sorrow and to stamp him out. I have clues which we can
+
+follow; but it is a long task, and a difficult, and there is danger in
+
+it, and pain. Shall you not all help me? We have learned to believe, all
+
+of us--is it not so? And since so, do we not see our duty? Yes! And do
+
+we not promise to go on to the bitter end?�
+
+Each in turn, we took his hand, and the promise was made. Then said the
+
+Professor as we moved off:--
+
+�Two nights hence you shall meet with me and dine together at seven of
+
+the clock with friend John. I shall entreat two others, two that you
+
+know not as yet; and I shall be ready to all our work show and our plans
+
+unfold. Friend John, you come with me home, for I have much to consult
+
+about, and you can help me. To-night I leave for Amsterdam, but shall
+
+return to-morrow night. And then begins our great quest. But first I
+
+shall have much to say, so that you may know what is to do and to dread.
+
+Then our promise shall be made to each other anew; for there is a
+
+terrible task before us, and once our feet are on the ploughshare we
+
+must not draw back.�

+CHAPTER III
+
+JONATHAN HARKER�S JOURNAL--_continued_
+
+When I found that I was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me.
+
+I rushed up and down the stairs, trying every door and peering out of
+
+every window I could find; but after a little the conviction of my
+
+helplessness overpowered all other feelings. When I look back after a
+
+few hours I think I must have been mad for the time, for I behaved much
+
+as a rat does in a trap. When, however, the conviction had come to me
+
+that I was helpless I sat down quietly--as quietly as I have ever done
+
+anything in my life--and began to think over what was best to be done. I
+
+am thinking still, and as yet have come to no definite conclusion. Of
+
+one thing only am I certain; that it is no use making my ideas known to
+
+the Count. He knows well that I am imprisoned; and as he has done it
+
+himself, and has doubtless his own motives for it, he would only deceive
+
+me if I trusted him fully with the facts. So far as I can see, my only
+
+plan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself, and my eyes
+
+open. I am, I know, either being deceived, like a baby, by my own fears,
+
+or else I am in desperate straits; and if the latter be so, I need, and
+
+shall need, all my brains to get through.
+
+I had hardly come to this conclusion when I heard the great door below
+
+shut, and knew that the Count had returned. He did not come at once into
+
+the library, so I went cautiously to my own room and found him making
+
+the bed. This was odd, but only confirmed what I had all along
+
+thought--that there were no servants in the house. When later I saw him
+
+through the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the
+
+dining-room, I was assured of it; for if he does himself all these
+
+menial offices, surely it is proof that there is no one else to do them.
+
+This gave me a fright, for if there is no one else in the castle, it
+
+must have been the Count himself who was the driver of the coach that
+
+brought me here. This is a terrible thought; for if so, what does it
+
+mean that he could control the wolves, as he did, by only holding up his
+
+hand in silence. How was it that all the people at Bistritz and on the
+
+coach had some terrible fear for me? What meant the giving of the
+
+crucifix, of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash? Bless
+
+that good, good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck! for it is a
+
+comfort and a strength to me whenever I touch it. It is odd that a thing
+
+which I have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous
+
+should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help. Is it that there
+
+is something in the essence of the thing itself, or that it is a medium,
+
+a tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort? Some
+
+time, if it may be, I must examine this matter and try to make up my
+
+mind about it. In the meantime I must find out all I can about Count
+
+Dracula, as it may help me to understand. To-night he may talk of
+
+himself, if I turn the conversation that way. I must be very careful,
+
+however, not to awake his suspicion.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_Midnight._--I have had a long talk with the Count. I asked him a few
+
+questions on Transylvania history, and he warmed up to the subject
+
+wonderfully. In his speaking of things and people, and especially of
+
+battles, he spoke as if he had been present at them all. This he
+
+afterwards explained by saying that to a _boyar_ the pride of his house
+
+and name is his own pride, that their glory is his glory, that their
+
+fate is his fate. Whenever he spoke of his house he always said �we,�
+
+and spoke almost in the plural, like a king speaking. I wish I could put
+
+down all he said exactly as he said it, for to me it was most
+
+fascinating. It seemed to have in it a whole history of the country. He
+
+grew excited as he spoke, and walked about the room pulling his great
+
+white moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands as
+
+though he would crush it by main strength. One thing he said which I
+
+shall put down as nearly as I can; for it tells in its way the story of
+
+his race:--
+
+�We Szekelys have a right to be proud, for in our veins flows the blood
+
+of many brave races who fought as the lion fights, for lordship. Here,
+
+in the whirlpool of European races, the Ugric tribe bore down from
+
+Iceland the fighting spirit which Thor and Wodin gave them, which their
+
+Berserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of Europe, ay,
+
+and of Asia and Africa too, till the peoples thought that the
+
+were-wolves themselves had come. Here, too, when they came, they found
+
+the Huns, whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame,
+
+till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those
+
+old witches, who, expelled from Scythia had mated with the devils in the
+
+desert. Fools, fools! What devil or what witch was ever so great as
+
+Attila, whose blood is in these veins?� He held up his arms. �Is it a
+
+wonder that we were a conquering race; that we were proud; that when the
+
+Magyar, the Lombard, the Avar, the Bulgar, or the Turk poured his
+
+thousands on our frontiers, we drove them back? Is it strange that when
+
+Arpad and his legions swept through the Hungarian fatherland he found us
+
+here when he reached the frontier; that the Honfoglalas was completed
+
+there? And when the Hungarian flood swept eastward, the Szekelys were
+
+claimed as kindred by the victorious Magyars, and to us for centuries
+
+was trusted the guarding of the frontier of Turkey-land; ay, and more
+
+than that, endless duty of the frontier guard, for, as the Turks say,
+
+�water sleeps, and enemy is sleepless.� Who more gladly than we
+
+throughout the Four Nations received the �bloody sword,� or at its
+
+warlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the King? When was
+
+redeemed that great shame of my nation, the shame of Cassova, when the
+
+flags of the Wallach and the Magyar went down beneath the Crescent? Who
+
+was it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat
+
+the Turk on his own ground? This was a Dracula indeed! Woe was it that
+
+his own unworthy brother, when he had fallen, sold his people to the
+
+Turk and brought the shame of slavery on them! Was it not this Dracula,
+
+indeed, who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and
+
+again brought his forces over the great river into Turkey-land; who,
+
+when he was beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had
+
+to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being
+
+slaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph! They
+
+said that he thought only of himself. Bah! what good are peasants
+
+without a leader? Where ends the war without a brain and heart to
+
+conduct it? Again, when, after the battle of Moh�cs, we threw off the
+
+Hungarian yoke, we of the Dracula blood were amongst their leaders, for
+
+our spirit would not brook that we were not free. Ah, young sir, the
+
+Szekelys--and the Dracula as their heart�s blood, their brains, and
+
+their swords--can boast a record that mushroom growths like the
+
+Hapsburgs and the Romanoffs can never reach. The warlike days are over.
+
+Blood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace; and
+
+the glories of the great races are as a tale that is told.�
+
+It was by this time close on morning, and we went to bed. (_Mem._, this
+
+diary seems horribly like the beginning of the �Arabian Nights,� for
+
+everything has to break off at cockcrow--or like the ghost of Hamlet�s
+
+father.)
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_12 May._--Let me begin with facts--bare, meagre facts, verified by
+
+books and figures, and of which there can be no doubt. I must not
+
+confuse them with experiences which will have to rest on my own
+
+observation, or my memory of them. Last evening when the Count came from
+
+his room he began by asking me questions on legal matters and on the
+
+doing of certain kinds of business. I had spent the day wearily over
+
+books, and, simply to keep my mind occupied, went over some of the
+
+matters I had been examining at Lincoln�s Inn. There was a certain
+
+method in the Count�s inquiries, so I shall try to put them down in
+
+sequence; the knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to me.
+
+First, he asked if a man in England might have two solicitors or more. I
+
+told him he might have a dozen if he wished, but that it would not be
+
+wise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction, as only
+
+one could act at a time, and that to change would be certain to militate
+
+against his interest. He seemed thoroughly to understand, and went on to
+
+ask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one man to
+
+attend, say, to banking, and another to look after shipping, in case
+
+local help were needed in a place far from the home of the banking
+
+solicitor. I asked him to explain more fully, so that I might not by any
+
+chance mislead him, so he said:--
+
+�I shall illustrate. Your friend and mine, Mr. Peter Hawkins, from under
+
+the shadow of your beautiful cathedral at Exeter, which is far from
+
+London, buys for me through your good self my place at London. Good! Now
+
+here let me say frankly, lest you should think it strange that I have
+
+sought the services of one so far off from London instead of some one
+
+resident there, that my motive was that no local interest might be
+
+served save my wish only; and as one of London residence might, perhaps,
+
+have some purpose of himself or friend to serve, I went thus afield to
+
+seek my agent, whose labours should be only to my interest. Now, suppose
+
+I, who have much of affairs, wish to ship goods, say, to Newcastle, or
+
+Durham, or Harwich, or Dover, might it not be that it could with more
+
+ease be done by consigning to one in these ports?� I answered that
+
+certainly it would be most easy, but that we solicitors had a system of
+
+agency one for the other, so that local work could be done locally on
+
+instruction from any solicitor, so that the client, simply placing
+
+himself in the hands of one man, could have his wishes carried out by
+
+him without further trouble.
+
+�But,� said he, �I could be at liberty to direct myself. Is it not so?�
+
+�Of course,� I replied; and �such is often done by men of business, who
+
+do not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person.�
+
+�Good!� he said, and then went on to ask about the means of making
+
+consignments and the forms to be gone through, and of all sorts of
+
+difficulties which might arise, but by forethought could be guarded
+
+against. I explained all these things to him to the best of my ability,
+
+and he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made a
+
+wonderful solicitor, for there was nothing that he did not think of or
+
+foresee. For a man who was never in the country, and who did not
+
+evidently do much in the way of business, his knowledge and acumen were
+
+wonderful. When he had satisfied himself on these points of which he had
+
+spoken, and I had verified all as well as I could by the books
+
+available, he suddenly stood up and said:--
+
+�Have you written since your first letter to our friend Mr. Peter
+
+Hawkins, or to any other?� It was with some bitterness in my heart that
+
+I answered that I had not, that as yet I had not seen any opportunity of
+
+sending letters to anybody.
+
+�Then write now, my young friend,� he said, laying a heavy hand on my
+
+shoulder: �write to our friend and to any other; and say, if it will
+
+please you, that you shall stay with me until a month from now.�
+
+�Do you wish me to stay so long?� I asked, for my heart grew cold at the
+
+thought.
+
+�I desire it much; nay, I will take no refusal. When your master,
+
+employer, what you will, engaged that someone should come on his behalf,
+
+it was understood that my needs only were to be consulted. I have not
+
+stinted. Is it not so?�
+
+What could I do but bow acceptance? It was Mr. Hawkins�s interest, not
+
+mine, and I had to think of him, not myself; and besides, while Count
+
+Dracula was speaking, there was that in his eyes and in his bearing
+
+which made me remember that I was a prisoner, and that if I wished it I
+
+could have no choice. The Count saw his victory in my bow, and his
+
+mastery in the trouble of my face, for he began at once to use them, but
+
+in his own smooth, resistless way:--
+
+�I pray you, my good young friend, that you will not discourse of things
+
+other than business in your letters. It will doubtless please your
+
+friends to know that you are well, and that you look forward to getting
+
+home to them. Is it not so?� As he spoke he handed me three sheets of
+
+note-paper and three envelopes. They were all of the thinnest foreign
+
+post, and looking at them, then at him, and noticing his quiet smile,
+
+with the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red underlip, I understood
+
+as well as if he had spoken that I should be careful what I wrote, for
+
+he would be able to read it. So I determined to write only formal notes
+
+now, but to write fully to Mr. Hawkins in secret, and also to Mina, for
+
+to her I could write in shorthand, which would puzzle the Count, if he
+
+did see it. When I had written my two letters I sat quiet, reading a
+
+book whilst the Count wrote several notes, referring as he wrote them to
+
+some books on his table. Then he took up my two and placed them with his
+
+own, and put by his writing materials, after which, the instant the door
+
+had closed behind him, I leaned over and looked at the letters, which
+
+were face down on the table. I felt no compunction in doing so, for
+
+under the circumstances I felt that I should protect myself in every way
+
+I could.
+
+One of the letters was directed to Samuel F. Billington, No. 7, The
+
+Crescent, Whitby, another to Herr Leutner, Varna; the third was to
+
+Coutts & Co., London, and the fourth to Herren Klopstock & Billreuth,
+
+bankers, Buda-Pesth. The second and fourth were unsealed. I was just
+
+about to look at them when I saw the door-handle move. I sank back in my
+
+seat, having just had time to replace the letters as they had been and
+
+to resume my book before the Count, holding still another letter in his
+
+hand, entered the room. He took up the letters on the table and stamped
+
+them carefully, and then turning to me, said:--
+
+�I trust you will forgive me, but I have much work to do in private this
+
+evening. You will, I hope, find all things as you wish.� At the door he
+
+turned, and after a moment�s pause said:--
+
+�Let me advise you, my dear young friend--nay, let me warn you with all
+
+seriousness, that should you leave these rooms you will not by any
+
+chance go to sleep in any other part of the castle. It is old, and has
+
+many memories, and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely. Be
+
+warned! Should sleep now or ever overcome you, or be like to do, then
+
+haste to your own chamber or to these rooms, for your rest will then be
+
+safe. But if you be not careful in this respect, then�--He finished his
+
+speech in a gruesome way, for he motioned with his hands as if he were
+
+washing them. I quite understood; my only doubt was as to whether any
+
+dream could be more terrible than the unnatural, horrible net of gloom
+
+and mystery which seemed closing around me.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_Later._--I endorse the last words written, but this time there is no
+
+doubt in question. I shall not fear to sleep in any place where he is
+
+not. I have placed the crucifix over the head of my bed--I imagine that
+
+my rest is thus freer from dreams; and there it shall remain.
+
+When he left me I went to my room. After a little while, not hearing any
+
+sound, I came out and went up the stone stair to where I could look out
+
+towards the South. There was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse,
+
+inaccessible though it was to me, as compared with the narrow darkness
+
+of the courtyard. Looking out on this, I felt that I was indeed in
+
+prison, and I seemed to want a breath of fresh air, though it were of
+
+the night. I am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me.
+
+It is destroying my nerve. I start at my own shadow, and am full of all
+
+sorts of horrible imaginings. God knows that there is ground for my
+
+terrible fear in this accursed place! I looked out over the beautiful
+
+expanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as
+
+day. In the soft light the distant hills became melted, and the shadows
+
+in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness. The mere beauty seemed
+
+to cheer me; there was peace and comfort in every breath I drew. As I
+
+leaned from the window my eye was caught by something moving a storey
+
+below me, and somewhat to my left, where I imagined, from the order of
+
+the rooms, that the windows of the Count�s own room would look out. The
+
+window at which I stood was tall and deep, stone-mullioned, and though
+
+weatherworn, was still complete; but it was evidently many a day since
+
+the case had been there. I drew back behind the stonework, and looked
+
+carefully out.
+
+What I saw was the Count�s head coming out from the window. I did not
+
+see the face, but I knew the man by the neck and the movement of his
+
+back and arms. In any case I could not mistake the hands which I had had
+
+so many opportunities of studying. I was at first interested and
+
+somewhat amused, for it is wonderful how small a matter will interest
+
+and amuse a man when he is a prisoner. But my very feelings changed to
+
+repulsion and terror when I saw the whole man slowly emerge from the
+
+window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss,
+
+_face down_ with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings. At
+
+first I could not believe my eyes. I thought it was some trick of the
+
+moonlight, some weird effect of shadow; but I kept looking, and it could
+
+be no delusion. I saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the
+
+stones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years, and by thus
+
+using every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable
+
+speed, just as a lizard moves along a wall.
+
+What manner of man is this, or what manner of creature is it in the
+
+semblance of man? I feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering
+
+me; I am in fear--in awful fear--and there is no escape for me; I am
+
+encompassed about with terrors that I dare not think of....
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_15 May._--Once more have I seen the Count go out in his lizard fashion.
+
+He moved downwards in a sidelong way, some hundred feet down, and a good
+
+deal to the left. He vanished into some hole or window. When his head
+
+had disappeared, I leaned out to try and see more, but without
+
+avail--the distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight. I
+
+knew he had left the castle now, and thought to use the opportunity to
+
+explore more than I had dared to do as yet. I went back to the room, and
+
+taking a lamp, tried all the doors. They were all locked, as I had
+
+expected, and the locks were comparatively new; but I went down the
+
+stone stairs to the hall where I had entered originally. I found I could
+
+pull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains; but the
+
+door was locked, and the key was gone! That key must be in the Count�s
+
+room; I must watch should his door be unlocked, so that I may get it and
+
+escape. I went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairs
+
+and passages, and to try the doors that opened from them. One or two
+
+small rooms near the hall were open, but there was nothing to see in
+
+them except old furniture, dusty with age and moth-eaten. At last,
+
+however, I found one door at the top of the stairway which, though it
+
+seemed to be locked, gave a little under pressure. I tried it harder,
+
+and found that it was not really locked, but that the resistance came
+
+from the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat, and the heavy door
+
+rested on the floor. Here was an opportunity which I might not have
+
+again, so I exerted myself, and with many efforts forced it back so that
+
+I could enter. I was now in a wing of the castle further to the right
+
+than the rooms I knew and a storey lower down. From the windows I could
+
+see that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle, the
+
+windows of the end room looking out both west and south. On the latter
+
+side, as well as to the former, there was a great precipice. The castle
+
+was built on the corner of a great rock, so that on three sides it was
+
+quite impregnable, and great windows were placed here where sling, or
+
+bow, or culverin could not reach, and consequently light and comfort,
+
+impossible to a position which had to be guarded, were secured. To the
+
+west was a great valley, and then, rising far away, great jagged
+
+mountain fastnesses, rising peak on peak, the sheer rock studded with
+
+mountain ash and thorn, whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and
+
+crannies of the stone. This was evidently the portion of the castle
+
+occupied by the ladies in bygone days, for the furniture had more air of
+
+comfort than any I had seen. The windows were curtainless, and the
+
+yellow moonlight, flooding in through the diamond panes, enabled one to
+
+see even colours, whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over
+
+all and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth. My
+
+lamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight, but I was
+
+glad to have it with me, for there was a dread loneliness in the place
+
+which chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble. Still, it was better
+
+than living alone in the rooms which I had come to hate from the
+
+presence of the Count, and after trying a little to school my nerves, I
+
+found a soft quietude come over me. Here I am, sitting at a little oak
+
+table where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much
+
+thought and many blushes, her ill-spelt love-letter, and writing in my
+
+diary in shorthand all that has happened since I closed it last. It is
+
+nineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance. And yet, unless my
+
+senses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of their own
+
+which mere �modernity� cannot kill.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_Later: the Morning of 16 May._--God preserve my sanity, for to this I
+
+am reduced. Safety and the assurance of safety are things of the past.
+
+Whilst I live on here there is but one thing to hope for, that I may not
+
+go mad, if, indeed, I be not mad already. If I be sane, then surely it
+
+is maddening to think that of all the foul things that lurk in this
+
+hateful place the Count is the least dreadful to me; that to him alone I
+
+can look for safety, even though this be only whilst I can serve his
+
+purpose. Great God! merciful God! Let me be calm, for out of that way
+
+lies madness indeed. I begin to get new lights on certain things which
+
+have puzzled me. Up to now I never quite knew what Shakespeare meant
+
+when he made Hamlet say:--
+
+�My tablets! quick, my tablets!
+
+�Tis meet that I put it down,� etc.,
+
+for now, feeling as though my own brain were unhinged or as if the shock
+
+had come which must end in its undoing, I turn to my diary for repose.
+
+The habit of entering accurately must help to soothe me.
+
+The Count�s mysterious warning frightened me at the time; it frightens
+
+me more now when I think of it, for in future he has a fearful hold upon
+
+me. I shall fear to doubt what he may say!
+
+When I had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book and
+
+pen in my pocket I felt sleepy. The Count�s warning came into my mind,
+
+but I took a pleasure in disobeying it. The sense of sleep was upon me,
+
+and with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider. The soft
+
+moonlight soothed, and the wide expanse without gave a sense of freedom
+
+which refreshed me. I determined not to return to-night to the
+
+gloom-haunted rooms, but to sleep here, where, of old, ladies had sat
+
+and sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for
+
+their menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars. I drew a great
+
+couch out of its place near the corner, so that as I lay, I could look
+
+at the lovely view to east and south, and unthinking of and uncaring for
+
+the dust, composed myself for sleep. I suppose I must have fallen
+
+asleep; I hope so, but I fear, for all that followed was startlingly
+
+real--so real that now sitting here in the broad, full sunlight of the
+
+morning, I cannot in the least believe that it was all sleep.
+
+I was not alone. The room was the same, unchanged in any way since I
+
+came into it; I could see along the floor, in the brilliant moonlight,
+
+my own footsteps marked where I had disturbed the long accumulation of
+
+dust. In the moonlight opposite me were three young women, ladies by
+
+their dress and manner. I thought at the time that I must be dreaming
+
+when I saw them, for, though the moonlight was behind them, they threw
+
+no shadow on the floor. They came close to me, and looked at me for some
+
+time, and then whispered together. Two were dark, and had high aquiline
+
+noses, like the Count, and great dark, piercing eyes that seemed to be
+
+almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon. The other was
+
+fair, as fair as can be, with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyes
+
+like pale sapphires. I seemed somehow to know her face, and to know it
+
+in connection with some dreamy fear, but I could not recollect at the
+
+moment how or where. All three had brilliant white teeth that shone like
+
+pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips. There was something
+
+about them that made me uneasy, some longing and at the same time some
+
+deadly fear. I felt in my heart a wicked, burning desire that they would
+
+kiss me with those red lips. It is not good to note this down, lest some
+
+day it should meet Mina�s eyes and cause her pain; but it is the truth.
+
+They whispered together, and then they all three laughed--such a
+
+silvery, musical laugh, but as hard as though the sound never could have
+
+come through the softness of human lips. It was like the intolerable,
+
+tingling sweetness of water-glasses when played on by a cunning hand.
+
+The fair girl shook her head coquettishly, and the other two urged her
+
+on. One said:--
+
+�Go on! You are first, and we shall follow; yours is the right to
+
+begin.� The other added:--
+
+�He is young and strong; there are kisses for us all.� I lay quiet,
+
+looking out under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation.
+
+The fair girl advanced and bent over me till I could feel the movement
+
+of her breath upon me. Sweet it was in one sense, honey-sweet, and sent
+
+the same tingling through the nerves as her voice, but with a bitter
+
+underlying the sweet, a bitter offensiveness, as one smells in blood.
+
+I was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly under
+
+the lashes. The girl went on her knees, and bent over me, simply
+
+gloating. There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling
+
+and repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips
+
+like an animal, till I could see in the moonlight the moisture shining
+
+on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp
+
+teeth. Lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of
+
+my mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my throat. Then she
+
+paused, and I could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked
+
+her teeth and lips, and could feel the hot breath on my neck. Then the
+
+skin of my throat began to tingle as one�s flesh does when the hand that
+
+is to tickle it approaches nearer--nearer. I could feel the soft,
+
+shivering touch of the lips on the super-sensitive skin of my throat,
+
+and the hard dents of two sharp teeth, just touching and pausing there.
+
+I closed my eyes in a languorous ecstasy and waited--waited with beating
+
+heart.
+
+But at that instant, another sensation swept through me as quick as
+
+lightning. I was conscious of the presence of the Count, and of his
+
+being as if lapped in a storm of fury. As my eyes opened involuntarily I
+
+saw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with
+
+giant�s power draw it back, the blue eyes transformed with fury, the
+
+white teeth champing with rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red with
+
+passion. But the Count! Never did I imagine such wrath and fury, even to
+
+the demons of the pit. His eyes were positively blazing. The red light
+
+in them was lurid, as if the flames of hell-fire blazed behind them. His
+
+face was deathly pale, and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires;
+
+the thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar
+
+of white-hot metal. With a fierce sweep of his arm, he hurled the woman
+
+from him, and then motioned to the others, as though he were beating
+
+them back; it was the same imperious gesture that I had seen used to the
+
+wolves. In a voice which, though low and almost in a whisper seemed to
+
+cut through the air and then ring round the room he said:--
+
+�How dare you touch him, any of you? How dare you cast eyes on him when
+
+I had forbidden it? Back, I tell you all! This man belongs to me! Beware
+
+how you meddle with him, or you�ll have to deal with me.� The fair girl,
+
+with a laugh of ribald coquetry, turned to answer him:--
+
+�You yourself never loved; you never love!� On this the other women
+
+joined, and such a mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang through the
+
+room that it almost made me faint to hear; it seemed like the pleasure
+
+of fiends. Then the Count turned, after looking at my face attentively,
+
+and said in a soft whisper:--
+
+�Yes, I too can love; you yourselves can tell it from the past. Is it
+
+not so? Well, now I promise you that when I am done with him you shall
+
+kiss him at your will. Now go! go! I must awaken him, for there is work
+
+to be done.�
+
+�Are we to have nothing to-night?� said one of them, with a low laugh,
+
+as she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor, and which
+
+moved as though there were some living thing within it. For answer he
+
+nodded his head. One of the women jumped forward and opened it. If my
+
+ears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail, as of a
+
+half-smothered child. The women closed round, whilst I was aghast with
+
+horror; but as I looked they disappeared, and with them the dreadful
+
+bag. There was no door near them, and they could not have passed me
+
+without my noticing. They simply seemed to fade into the rays of the
+
+moonlight and pass out through the window, for I could see outside the
+
+dim, shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely faded away.
+
+Then the horror overcame me, and I sank down unconscious.

+CHAPTER IV
+
+JONATHAN HARKER�S JOURNAL--_continued_
+
+I awoke in my own bed. If it be that I had not dreamt, the Count must
+
+have carried me here. I tried to satisfy myself on the subject, but
+
+could not arrive at any unquestionable result. To be sure, there were
+
+certain small evidences, such as that my clothes were folded and laid by
+
+in a manner which was not my habit. My watch was still unwound, and I am
+
+rigorously accustomed to wind it the last thing before going to bed, and
+
+many such details. But these things are no proof, for they may have been
+
+evidences that my mind was not as usual, and, from some cause or
+
+another, I had certainly been much upset. I must watch for proof. Of one
+
+thing I am glad: if it was that the Count carried me here and undressed
+
+me, he must have been hurried in his task, for my pockets are intact. I
+
+am sure this diary would have been a mystery to him which he would not
+
+have brooked. He would have taken or destroyed it. As I look round this
+
+room, although it has been to me so full of fear, it is now a sort of
+
+sanctuary, for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful women, who
+
+were--who _are_--waiting to suck my blood.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_18 May._--I have been down to look at that room again in daylight, for
+
+I _must_ know the truth. When I got to the doorway at the top of the
+
+stairs I found it closed. It had been so forcibly driven against the
+
+jamb that part of the woodwork was splintered. I could see that the bolt
+
+of the lock had not been shot, but the door is fastened from the inside.
+
+I fear it was no dream, and must act on this surmise.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_19 May._--I am surely in the toils. Last night the Count asked me in
+
+the suavest tones to write three letters, one saying that my work here
+
+was nearly done, and that I should start for home within a few days,
+
+another that I was starting on the next morning from the time of the
+
+letter, and the third that I had left the castle and arrived at
+
+Bistritz. I would fain have rebelled, but felt that in the present state
+
+of things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the Count whilst I
+
+am so absolutely in his power; and to refuse would be to excite his
+
+suspicion and to arouse his anger. He knows that I know too much, and
+
+that I must not live, lest I be dangerous to him; my only chance is to
+
+prolong my opportunities. Something may occur which will give me a
+
+chance to escape. I saw in his eyes something of that gathering wrath
+
+which was manifest when he hurled that fair woman from him. He explained
+
+to me that posts were few and uncertain, and that my writing now would
+
+ensure ease of mind to my friends; and he assured me with so much
+
+impressiveness that he would countermand the later letters, which would
+
+be held over at Bistritz until due time in case chance would admit of my
+
+prolonging my stay, that to oppose him would have been to create new
+
+suspicion. I therefore pretended to fall in with his views, and asked
+
+him what dates I should put on the letters. He calculated a minute, and
+
+then said:--
+
+�The first should be June 12, the second June 19, and the third June
+
+29.�
+
+I know now the span of my life. God help me!
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_28 May._--There is a chance of escape, or at any rate of being able to
+
+send word home. A band of Szgany have come to the castle, and are
+
+encamped in the courtyard. These Szgany are gipsies; I have notes of
+
+them in my book. They are peculiar to this part of the world, though
+
+allied to the ordinary gipsies all the world over. There are thousands
+
+of them in Hungary and Transylvania, who are almost outside all law.
+
+They attach themselves as a rule to some great noble or _boyar_, and
+
+call themselves by his name. They are fearless and without religion,
+
+save superstition, and they talk only their own varieties of the Romany
+
+tongue.
+
+I shall write some letters home, and shall try to get them to have them
+
+posted. I have already spoken them through my window to begin
+
+acquaintanceship. They took their hats off and made obeisance and many
+
+signs, which, however, I could not understand any more than I could
+
+their spoken language....
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+I have written the letters. Mina�s is in shorthand, and I simply ask Mr.
+
+Hawkins to communicate with her. To her I have explained my situation,
+
+but without the horrors which I may only surmise. It would shock and
+
+frighten her to death were I to expose my heart to her. Should the
+
+letters not carry, then the Count shall not yet know my secret or the
+
+extent of my knowledge....
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+I have given the letters; I threw them through the bars of my window
+
+with a gold piece, and made what signs I could to have them posted. The
+
+man who took them pressed them to his heart and bowed, and then put them
+
+in his cap. I could do no more. I stole back to the study, and began to
+
+read. As the Count did not come in, I have written here....
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+The Count has come. He sat down beside me, and said in his smoothest
+
+voice as he opened two letters:--
+
+�The Szgany has given me these, of which, though I know not whence they
+
+come, I shall, of course, take care. See!�--he must have looked at
+
+it--�one is from you, and to my friend Peter Hawkins; the other�--here
+
+he caught sight of the strange symbols as he opened the envelope, and
+
+the dark look came into his face, and his eyes blazed wickedly--�the
+
+other is a vile thing, an outrage upon friendship and hospitality! It is
+
+not signed. Well! so it cannot matter to us.� And he calmly held letter
+
+and envelope in the flame of the lamp till they were consumed. Then he
+
+went on:--
+
+�The letter to Hawkins--that I shall, of course, send on, since it is
+
+yours. Your letters are sacred to me. Your pardon, my friend, that
+
+unknowingly I did break the seal. Will you not cover it again?� He held
+
+out the letter to me, and with a courteous bow handed me a clean
+
+envelope. I could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence. When
+
+he went out of the room I could hear the key turn softly. A minute later
+
+I went over and tried it, and the door was locked.
+
+When, an hour or two after, the Count came quietly into the room, his
+
+coming awakened me, for I had gone to sleep on the sofa. He was very
+
+courteous and very cheery in his manner, and seeing that I had been
+
+sleeping, he said:--
+
+�So, my friend, you are tired? Get to bed. There is the surest rest. I
+
+may not have the pleasure to talk to-night, since there are many labours
+
+to me; but you will sleep, I pray.� I passed to my room and went to bed,
+
+and, strange to say, slept without dreaming. Despair has its own calms.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_31 May._--This morning when I woke I thought I would provide myself
+
+with some paper and envelopes from my bag and keep them in my pocket, so
+
+that I might write in case I should get an opportunity, but again a
+
+surprise, again a shock!
+
+Every scrap of paper was gone, and with it all my notes, my memoranda,
+
+relating to railways and travel, my letter of credit, in fact all that
+
+might be useful to me were I once outside the castle. I sat and pondered
+
+awhile, and then some thought occurred to me, and I made search of my
+
+portmanteau and in the wardrobe where I had placed my clothes.
+
+The suit in which I had travelled was gone, and also my overcoat and
+
+rug; I could find no trace of them anywhere. This looked like some new
+
+scheme of villainy....
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_17 June._--This morning, as I was sitting on the edge of my bed
+
+cudgelling my brains, I heard without a cracking of whips and pounding
+
+and scraping of horses� feet up the rocky path beyond the courtyard.
+
+With joy I hurried to the window, and saw drive into the yard two great
+
+leiter-wagons, each drawn by eight sturdy horses, and at the head of
+
+each pair a Slovak, with his wide hat, great nail-studded belt, dirty
+
+sheepskin, and high boots. They had also their long staves in hand. I
+
+ran to the door, intending to descend and try and join them through the
+
+main hall, as I thought that way might be opened for them. Again a
+
+shock: my door was fastened on the outside.
+
+Then I ran to the window and cried to them. They looked up at me
+
+stupidly and pointed, but just then the �hetman� of the Szgany came out,
+
+and seeing them pointing to my window, said something, at which they
+
+laughed. Henceforth no effort of mine, no piteous cry or agonised
+
+entreaty, would make them even look at me. They resolutely turned away.
+
+The leiter-wagons contained great, square boxes, with handles of thick
+
+rope; these were evidently empty by the ease with which the Slovaks
+
+handled them, and by their resonance as they were roughly moved. When
+
+they were all unloaded and packed in a great heap in one corner of the
+
+yard, the Slovaks were given some money by the Szgany, and spitting on
+
+it for luck, lazily went each to his horse�s head. Shortly afterwards, I
+
+heard the cracking of their whips die away in the distance.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_24 June, before morning._--Last night the Count left me early, and
+
+locked himself into his own room. As soon as I dared I ran up the
+
+winding stair, and looked out of the window, which opened south. I
+
+thought I would watch for the Count, for there is something going on.
+
+The Szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing work of
+
+some kind. I know it, for now and then I hear a far-away muffled sound
+
+as of mattock and spade, and, whatever it is, it must be the end of some
+
+ruthless villainy.
+
+I had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour, when I saw
+
+something coming out of the Count�s window. I drew back and watched
+
+carefully, and saw the whole man emerge. It was a new shock to me to
+
+find that he had on the suit of clothes which I had worn whilst
+
+travelling here, and slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which I
+
+had seen the women take away. There could be no doubt as to his quest,
+
+and in my garb, too! This, then, is his new scheme of evil: that he will
+
+allow others to see me, as they think, so that he may both leave
+
+evidence that I have been seen in the towns or villages posting my own
+
+letters, and that any wickedness which he may do shall by the local
+
+people be attributed to me.
+
+It makes me rage to think that this can go on, and whilst I am shut up
+
+here, a veritable prisoner, but without that protection of the law which
+
+is even a criminal�s right and consolation.
+
+I thought I would watch for the Count�s return, and for a long time sat
+
+doggedly at the window. Then I began to notice that there were some
+
+quaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight. They were
+
+like the tiniest grains of dust, and they whirled round and gathered in
+
+clusters in a nebulous sort of way. I watched them with a sense of
+
+soothing, and a sort of calm stole over me. I leaned back in the
+
+embrasure in a more comfortable position, so that I could enjoy more
+
+fully the a�rial gambolling.
+
+Something made me start up, a low, piteous howling of dogs somewhere far
+
+below in the valley, which was hidden from my sight. Louder it seemed to
+
+ring in my ears, and the floating motes of dust to take new shapes to
+
+the sound as they danced in the moonlight. I felt myself struggling to
+
+awake to some call of my instincts; nay, my very soul was struggling,
+
+and my half-remembered sensibilities were striving to answer the call. I
+
+was becoming hypnotised! Quicker and quicker danced the dust; the
+
+moonbeams seemed to quiver as they went by me into the mass of gloom
+
+beyond. More and more they gathered till they seemed to take dim phantom
+
+shapes. And then I started, broad awake and in full possession of my
+
+senses, and ran screaming from the place. The phantom shapes, which were
+
+becoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams, were those of the
+
+three ghostly women to whom I was doomed. I fled, and felt somewhat
+
+safer in my own room, where there was no moonlight and where the lamp
+
+was burning brightly.
+
+When a couple of hours had passed I heard something stirring in the
+
+Count�s room, something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed; and then
+
+there was silence, deep, awful silence, which chilled me. With a
+
+beating heart, I tried the door; but I was locked in my prison, and
+
+could do nothing. I sat down and simply cried.
+
+As I sat I heard a sound in the courtyard without--the agonised cry of a
+
+woman. I rushed to the window, and throwing it up, peered out between
+
+the bars. There, indeed, was a woman with dishevelled hair, holding her
+
+hands over her heart as one distressed with running. She was leaning
+
+against a corner of the gateway. When she saw my face at the window she
+
+threw herself forward, and shouted in a voice laden with menace:--
+
+�Monster, give me my child!�
+
+She threw herself on her knees, and raising up her hands, cried the same
+
+words in tones which wrung my heart. Then she tore her hair and beat her
+
+breast, and abandoned herself to all the violences of extravagant
+
+emotion. Finally, she threw herself forward, and, though I could not see
+
+her, I could hear the beating of her naked hands against the door.
+
+Somewhere high overhead, probably on the tower, I heard the voice of the
+
+Count calling in his harsh, metallic whisper. His call seemed to be
+
+answered from far and wide by the howling of wolves. Before many minutes
+
+had passed a pack of them poured, like a pent-up dam when liberated,
+
+through the wide entrance into the courtyard.
+
+There was no cry from the woman, and the howling of the wolves was but
+
+short. Before long they streamed away singly, licking their lips.
+
+I could not pity her, for I knew now what had become of her child, and
+
+she was better dead.
+
+What shall I do? what can I do? How can I escape from this dreadful
+
+thing of night and gloom and fear?
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_25 June, morning._--No man knows till he has suffered from the night
+
+how sweet and how dear to his heart and eye the morning can be. When the
+
+sun grew so high this morning that it struck the top of the great
+
+gateway opposite my window, the high spot which it touched seemed to me
+
+as if the dove from the ark had lighted there. My fear fell from me as
+
+if it had been a vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth. I must
+
+take action of some sort whilst the courage of the day is upon me. Last
+
+night one of my post-dated letters went to post, the first of that fatal
+
+series which is to blot out the very traces of my existence from the
+
+earth.
+
+Let me not think of it. Action!
+
+It has always been at night-time that I have been molested or
+
+threatened, or in some way in danger or in fear. I have not yet seen the
+
+Count in the daylight. Can it be that he sleeps when others wake, that
+
+he may be awake whilst they sleep? If I could only get into his room!
+
+But there is no possible way. The door is always locked, no way for me.
+
+Yes, there is a way, if one dares to take it. Where his body has gone
+
+why may not another body go? I have seen him myself crawl from his
+
+window. Why should not I imitate him, and go in by his window? The
+
+chances are desperate, but my need is more desperate still. I shall risk
+
+it. At the worst it can only be death; and a man�s death is not a
+
+calf�s, and the dreaded Hereafter may still be open to me. God help me
+
+in my task! Good-bye, Mina, if I fail; good-bye, my faithful friend and
+
+second father; good-bye, all, and last of all Mina!
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_Same day, later._--I have made the effort, and God, helping me, have
+
+come safely back to this room. I must put down every detail in order. I
+
+went whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the south
+
+side, and at once got outside on the narrow ledge of stone which runs
+
+around the building on this side. The stones are big and roughly cut,
+
+and the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them. I
+
+took off my boots, and ventured out on the desperate way. I looked down
+
+once, so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful depth would
+
+not overcome me, but after that kept my eyes away from it. I knew pretty
+
+well the direction and distance of the Count�s window, and made for it
+
+as well as I could, having regard to the opportunities available. I did
+
+not feel dizzy--I suppose I was too excited--and the time seemed
+
+ridiculously short till I found myself standing on the window-sill and
+
+trying to raise up the sash. I was filled with agitation, however, when
+
+I bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window. Then I looked
+
+around for the Count, but, with surprise and gladness, made a discovery.
+
+The room was empty! It was barely furnished with odd things, which
+
+seemed to have never been used; the furniture was something the same
+
+style as that in the south rooms, and was covered with dust. I looked
+
+for the key, but it was not in the lock, and I could not find it
+
+anywhere. The only thing I found was a great heap of gold in one
+
+corner--gold of all kinds, Roman, and British, and Austrian, and
+
+Hungarian, and Greek and Turkish money, covered with a film of dust, as
+
+though it had lain long in the ground. None of it that I noticed was
+
+less than three hundred years old. There were also chains and ornaments,
+
+some jewelled, but all of them old and stained.
+
+At one corner of the room was a heavy door. I tried it, for, since I
+
+could not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door, which
+
+was the main object of my search, I must make further examination, or
+
+all my efforts would be in vain. It was open, and led through a stone
+
+passage to a circular stairway, which went steeply down. I descended,
+
+minding carefully where I went, for the stairs were dark, being only lit
+
+by loopholes in the heavy masonry. At the bottom there was a dark,
+
+tunnel-like passage, through which came a deathly, sickly odour, the
+
+odour of old earth newly turned. As I went through the passage the smell
+
+grew closer and heavier. At last I pulled open a heavy door which stood
+
+ajar, and found myself in an old, ruined chapel, which had evidently
+
+been used as a graveyard. The roof was broken, and in two places were
+
+steps leading to vaults, but the ground had recently been dug over, and
+
+the earth placed in great wooden boxes, manifestly those which had been
+
+brought by the Slovaks. There was nobody about, and I made search for
+
+any further outlet, but there was none. Then I went over every inch of
+
+the ground, so as not to lose a chance. I went down even into the
+
+vaults, where the dim light struggled, although to do so was a dread to
+
+my very soul. Into two of these I went, but saw nothing except fragments
+
+of old coffins and piles of dust; in the third, however, I made a
+
+discovery.
+
+There, in one of the great boxes, of which there were fifty in all, on a
+
+pile of newly dug earth, lay the Count! He was either dead or asleep, I
+
+could not say which--for the eyes were open and stony, but without the
+
+glassiness of death--and the cheeks had the warmth of life through all
+
+their pallor; the lips were as red as ever. But there was no sign of
+
+movement, no pulse, no breath, no beating of the heart. I bent over him,
+
+and tried to find any sign of life, but in vain. He could not have lain
+
+there long, for the earthy smell would have passed away in a few hours.
+
+By the side of the box was its cover, pierced with holes here and there.
+
+I thought he might have the keys on him, but when I went to search I saw
+
+the dead eyes, and in them, dead though they were, such a look of hate,
+
+though unconscious of me or my presence, that I fled from the place, and
+
+leaving the Count�s room by the window, crawled again up the castle
+
+wall. Regaining my room, I threw myself panting upon the bed and tried
+
+to think....
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_29 June._--To-day is the date of my last letter, and the Count has
+
+taken steps to prove that it was genuine, for again I saw him leave the
+
+castle by the same window, and in my clothes. As he went down the wall,
+
+lizard fashion, I wished I had a gun or some lethal weapon, that I might
+
+destroy him; but I fear that no weapon wrought alone by man�s hand would
+
+have any effect on him. I dared not wait to see him return, for I feared
+
+to see those weird sisters. I came back to the library, and read there
+
+till I fell asleep.
+
+I was awakened by the Count, who looked at me as grimly as a man can
+
+look as he said:--
+
+�To-morrow, my friend, we must part. You return to your beautiful
+
+England, I to some work which may have such an end that we may never
+
+meet. Your letter home has been despatched; to-morrow I shall not be
+
+here, but all shall be ready for your journey. In the morning come the
+
+Szgany, who have some labours of their own here, and also come some
+
+Slovaks. When they have gone, my carriage shall come for you, and shall
+
+bear you to the Borgo Pass to meet the diligence from Bukovina to
+
+Bistritz. But I am in hopes that I shall see more of you at Castle
+
+Dracula.� I suspected him, and determined to test his sincerity.
+
+Sincerity! It seems like a profanation of the word to write it in
+
+connection with such a monster, so asked him point-blank:--
+
+�Why may I not go to-night?�
+
+�Because, dear sir, my coachman and horses are away on a mission.�
+
+�But I would walk with pleasure. I want to get away at once.� He smiled,
+
+such a soft, smooth, diabolical smile that I knew there was some trick
+
+behind his smoothness. He said:--
+
+�And your baggage?�
+
+�I do not care about it. I can send for it some other time.�
+
+The Count stood up, and said, with a sweet courtesy which made me rub my
+
+eyes, it seemed so real:--
+
+�You English have a saying which is close to my heart, for its spirit is
+
+that which rules our _boyars_: �Welcome the coming; speed the parting
+
+guest.� Come with me, my dear young friend. Not an hour shall you wait
+
+in my house against your will, though sad am I at your going, and that
+
+you so suddenly desire it. Come!� With a stately gravity, he, with the
+
+lamp, preceded me down the stairs and along the hall. Suddenly he
+
+stopped.
+
+�Hark!�
+
+Close at hand came the howling of many wolves. It was almost as if the
+
+sound sprang up at the rising of his hand, just as the music of a great
+
+orchestra seems to leap under the b�ton of the conductor. After a pause
+
+of a moment, he proceeded, in his stately way, to the door, drew back
+
+the ponderous bolts, unhooked the heavy chains, and began to draw it
+
+open.
+
+To my intense astonishment I saw that it was unlocked. Suspiciously, I
+
+looked all round, but could see no key of any kind.
+
+As the door began to open, the howling of the wolves without grew louder
+
+and angrier; their red jaws, with champing teeth, and their blunt-clawed
+
+feet as they leaped, came in through the opening door. I knew then that
+
+to struggle at the moment against the Count was useless. With such
+
+allies as these at his command, I could do nothing. But still the door
+
+continued slowly to open, and only the Count�s body stood in the gap.
+
+Suddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and means of my
+
+doom; I was to be given to the wolves, and at my own instigation. There
+
+was a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the Count, and
+
+as a last chance I cried out:--
+
+�Shut the door; I shall wait till morning!� and covered my face with my
+
+hands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment. With one sweep of his
+
+powerful arm, the Count threw the door shut, and the great bolts clanged
+
+and echoed through the hall as they shot back into their places.
+
+In silence we returned to the library, and after a minute or two I went
+
+to my own room. The last I saw of Count Dracula was his kissing his hand
+
+to me; with a red light of triumph in his eyes, and with a smile that
+
+Judas in hell might be proud of.
+
+When I was in my room and about to lie down, I thought I heard a
+
+whispering at my door. I went to it softly and listened. Unless my ears
+
+deceived me, I heard the voice of the Count:--
+
+�Back, back, to your own place! Your time is not yet come. Wait! Have
+
+patience! To-night is mine. To-morrow night is yours!� There was a low,
+
+sweet ripple of laughter, and in a rage I threw open the door, and saw
+
+without the three terrible women licking their lips. As I appeared they
+
+all joined in a horrible laugh, and ran away.
+
+I came back to my room and threw myself on my knees. It is then so near
+
+the end? To-morrow! to-morrow! Lord, help me, and those to whom I am
+
+dear!
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_30 June, morning._--These may be the last words I ever write in this
+
+diary. I slept till just before the dawn, and when I woke threw myself
+
+on my knees, for I determined that if Death came he should find me
+
+ready.
+
+At last I felt that subtle change in the air, and knew that the morning
+
+had come. Then came the welcome cock-crow, and I felt that I was safe.
+
+With a glad heart, I opened my door and ran down to the hall. I had seen
+
+that the door was unlocked, and now escape was before me. With hands
+
+that trembled with eagerness, I unhooked the chains and drew back the
+
+massive bolts.
+
+But the door would not move. Despair seized me. I pulled, and pulled, at
+
+the door, and shook it till, massive as it was, it rattled in its
+
+casement. I could see the bolt shot. It had been locked after I left the
+
+Count.
+
+Then a wild desire took me to obtain that key at any risk, and I
+
+determined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the Count�s
+
+room. He might kill me, but death now seemed the happier choice of
+
+evils. Without a pause I rushed up to the east window, and scrambled
+
+down the wall, as before, into the Count�s room. It was empty, but that
+
+was as I expected. I could not see a key anywhere, but the heap of gold
+
+remained. I went through the door in the corner and down the winding
+
+stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel. I knew now well
+
+enough where to find the monster I sought.
+
+The great box was in the same place, close against the wall, but the lid
+
+was laid on it, not fastened down, but with the nails ready in their
+
+places to be hammered home. I knew I must reach the body for the key, so
+
+I raised the lid, and laid it back against the wall; and then I saw
+
+something which filled my very soul with horror. There lay the Count,
+
+but looking as if his youth had been half renewed, for the white hair
+
+and moustache were changed to dark iron-grey; the cheeks were fuller,
+
+and the white skin seemed ruby-red underneath; the mouth was redder than
+
+ever, for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood, which trickled from the
+
+corners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck. Even the deep,
+
+burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh, for the lids and pouches
+
+underneath were bloated. It seemed as if the whole awful creature were
+
+simply gorged with blood. He lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with his
+
+repletion. I shuddered as I bent over to touch him, and every sense in
+
+me revolted at the contact; but I had to search, or I was lost. The
+
+coming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar way to those
+
+horrid three. I felt all over the body, but no sign could I find of the
+
+key. Then I stopped and looked at the Count. There was a mocking smile
+
+on the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad. This was the being I
+
+was helping to transfer to London, where, perhaps, for centuries to come
+
+he might, amongst its teeming millions, satiate his lust for blood, and
+
+create a new and ever-widening circle of semi-demons to batten on the
+
+helpless. The very thought drove me mad. A terrible desire came upon me
+
+to rid the world of such a monster. There was no lethal weapon at hand,
+
+but I seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the
+
+cases, and lifting it high, struck, with the edge downward, at the
+
+hateful face. But as I did so the head turned, and the eyes fell full
+
+upon me, with all their blaze of basilisk horror. The sight seemed to
+
+paralyse me, and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face,
+
+merely making a deep gash above the forehead. The shovel fell from my
+
+hand across the box, and as I pulled it away the flange of the blade
+
+caught the edge of the lid which fell over again, and hid the horrid
+
+thing from my sight. The last glimpse I had was of the bloated face,
+
+blood-stained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held its
+
+own in the nethermost hell.
+
+I thought and thought what should be my next move, but my brain seemed
+
+on fire, and I waited with a despairing feeling growing over me. As I
+
+waited I heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices coming
+
+closer, and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and the
+
+cracking of whips; the Szgany and the Slovaks of whom the Count had
+
+spoken were coming. With a last look around and at the box which
+
+contained the vile body, I ran from the place and gained the Count�s
+
+room, determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened.
+
+With strained ears, I listened, and heard downstairs the grinding of the
+
+key in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door. There must
+
+have been some other means of entry, or some one had a key for one of
+
+the locked doors. Then there came the sound of many feet tramping and
+
+dying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo. I turned to
+
+run down again towards the vault, where I might find the new entrance;
+
+but at the moment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind, and the
+
+door to the winding stair blew to with a shock that set the dust from
+
+the lintels flying. When I ran to push it open, I found that it was
+
+hopelessly fast. I was again a prisoner, and the net of doom was closing
+
+round me more closely.
+
+As I write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feet
+
+and the crash of weights being set down heavily, doubtless the boxes,
+
+with their freight of earth. There is a sound of hammering; it is the
+
+box being nailed down. Now I can hear the heavy feet tramping again
+
+along the hall, with many other idle feet coming behind them.
+
+The door is shut, and the chains rattle; there is a grinding of the key
+
+in the lock; I can hear the key withdraw: then another door opens and
+
+shuts; I hear the creaking of lock and bolt.
+
+Hark! in the courtyard and down the rocky way the roll of heavy wheels,
+
+the crack of whips, and the chorus of the Szgany as they pass into the
+
+distance.
+
+I am alone in the castle with those awful women. Faugh! Mina is a woman,
+
+and there is nought in common. They are devils of the Pit!
+
+I shall not remain alone with them; I shall try to scale the castle wall
+
+farther than I have yet attempted. I shall take some of the gold with
+
+me, lest I want it later. I may find a way from this dreadful place.
+
+And then away for home! away to the quickest and nearest train! away
+
+from this cursed spot, from this cursed land, where the devil and his
+
+children still walk with earthly feet!
+
+At least God�s mercy is better than that of these monsters, and the
+
+precipice is steep and high. At its foot a man may sleep--as a man.
+
+Good-bye, all! Mina!
+
+CHAPTER V
+
+_Letter from Miss Mina Murray to Miss Lucy Westenra._
+
+�_9 May._
+
+�My dearest Lucy,--
+
+�Forgive my long delay in writing, but I have been simply overwhelmed
+
+with work. The life of an assistant schoolmistress is sometimes trying.
+
+I am longing to be with you, and by the sea, where we can talk together
+
+freely and build our castles in the air. I have been working very hard
+
+lately, because I want to keep up with Jonathan�s studies, and I have
+
+been practising shorthand very assiduously. When we are married I shall
+
+be able to be useful to Jonathan, and if I can stenograph well enough I
+
+can take down what he wants to say in this way and write it out for
+
+him on the typewriter, at which also I am practising very hard. He
+
+and I sometimes write letters in shorthand, and he is keeping a
+
+stenographic journal of his travels abroad. When I am with you I
+
+shall keep a diary in the same way. I don�t mean one of those
+
+two-pages-to-the-week-with-Sunday-squeezed-in-a-corner diaries, but a
+
+sort of journal which I can write in whenever I feel inclined. I do not
+
+suppose there will be much of interest to other people; but it is not
+
+intended for them. I may show it to Jonathan some day if there is in it
+
+anything worth sharing, but it is really an exercise book. I shall try
+
+to do what I see lady journalists do: interviewing and writing
+
+descriptions and trying to remember conversations. I am told that, with
+
+a little practice, one can remember all that goes on or that one hears
+
+said during a day. However, we shall see. I will tell you of my little
+
+plans when we meet. I have just had a few hurried lines from Jonathan
+
+from Transylvania. He is well, and will be returning in about a week. I
+
+am longing to hear all his news. It must be so nice to see strange
+
+countries. I wonder if we--I mean Jonathan and I--shall ever see them
+
+together. There is the ten o�clock bell ringing. Good-bye.
+
+�Your loving
+
+�MINA.
+
+�Tell me all the news when you write. You have not told me anything for
+
+a long time. I hear rumours, and especially of a tall, handsome,
+
+curly-haired man???�
+
+_Letter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Murray_.
+
+�_17, Chatham Street_,
+
+�_Wednesday_.
+
+�My dearest Mina,--
+
+�I must say you tax me _very_ unfairly with being a bad correspondent. I
+
+wrote to you _twice_ since we parted, and your last letter was only your
+
+_second_. Besides, I have nothing to tell you. There is really nothing
+
+to interest you. Town is very pleasant just now, and we go a good deal
+
+to picture-galleries and for walks and rides in the park. As to the
+
+tall, curly-haired man, I suppose it was the one who was with me at the
+
+last Pop. Some one has evidently been telling tales. That was Mr.
+
+Holmwood. He often comes to see us, and he and mamma get on very well
+
+together; they have so many things to talk about in common. We met some
+
+time ago a man that would just _do for you_, if you were not already
+
+engaged to Jonathan. He is an excellent _parti_, being handsome, well
+
+off, and of good birth. He is a doctor and really clever. Just fancy! He
+
+is only nine-and-twenty, and he has an immense lunatic asylum all under
+
+his own care. Mr. Holmwood introduced him to me, and he called here to
+
+see us, and often comes now. I think he is one of the most resolute men
+
+I ever saw, and yet the most calm. He seems absolutely imperturbable. I
+
+can fancy what a wonderful power he must have over his patients. He has
+
+a curious habit of looking one straight in the face, as if trying to
+
+read one�s thoughts. He tries this on very much with me, but I flatter
+
+myself he has got a tough nut to crack. I know that from my glass. Do
+
+you ever try to read your own face? _I do_, and I can tell you it is not
+
+a bad study, and gives you more trouble than you can well fancy if you
+
+have never tried it. He says that I afford him a curious psychological
+
+study, and I humbly think I do. I do not, as you know, take sufficient
+
+interest in dress to be able to describe the new fashions. Dress is a
+
+bore. That is slang again, but never mind; Arthur says that every day.
+
+There, it is all out. Mina, we have told all our secrets to each other
+
+since we were _children_; we have slept together and eaten together, and
+
+laughed and cried together; and now, though I have spoken, I would like
+
+to speak more. Oh, Mina, couldn�t you guess? I love him. I am blushing
+
+as I write, for although I _think_ he loves me, he has not told me so in
+
+words. But oh, Mina, I love him; I love him; I love him! There, that
+
+does me good. I wish I were with you, dear, sitting by the fire
+
+undressing, as we used to sit; and I would try to tell you what I feel.
+
+I do not know how I am writing this even to you. I am afraid to stop,
+
+or I should tear up the letter, and I don�t want to stop, for I _do_ so
+
+want to tell you all. Let me hear from you _at once_, and tell me all
+
+that you think about it. Mina, I must stop. Good-night. Bless me in your
+
+prayers; and, Mina, pray for my happiness.
+
+�LUCY.
+
+�P.S.--I need not tell you this is a secret. Good-night again.
+
+�L.�
+
+_Letter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Murray_.
+
+�_24 May_.
+
+�My dearest Mina,--
+
+�Thanks, and thanks, and thanks again for your sweet letter. It was so
+
+nice to be able to tell you and to have your sympathy.
+
+�My dear, it never rains but it pours. How true the old proverbs are.
+
+Here am I, who shall be twenty in September, and yet I never had a
+
+proposal till to-day, not a real proposal, and to-day I have had three.
+
+Just fancy! THREE proposals in one day! Isn�t it awful! I feel sorry,
+
+really and truly sorry, for two of the poor fellows. Oh, Mina, I am so
+
+happy that I don�t know what to do with myself. And three proposals!
+
+But, for goodness� sake, don�t tell any of the girls, or they would be
+
+getting all sorts of extravagant ideas and imagining themselves injured
+
+and slighted if in their very first day at home they did not get six at
+
+least. Some girls are so vain! You and I, Mina dear, who are engaged and
+
+are going to settle down soon soberly into old married women, can
+
+despise vanity. Well, I must tell you about the three, but you must keep
+
+it a secret, dear, from _every one_, except, of course, Jonathan. You
+
+will tell him, because I would, if I were in your place, certainly tell
+
+Arthur. A woman ought to tell her husband everything--don�t you think
+
+so, dear?--and I must be fair. Men like women, certainly their wives, to
+
+be quite as fair as they are; and women, I am afraid, are not always
+
+quite as fair as they should be. Well, my dear, number One came just
+
+before lunch. I told you of him, Dr. John Seward, the lunatic-asylum
+
+man, with the strong jaw and the good forehead. He was very cool
+
+outwardly, but was nervous all the same. He had evidently been schooling
+
+himself as to all sorts of little things, and remembered them; but he
+
+almost managed to sit down on his silk hat, which men don�t generally do
+
+when they are cool, and then when he wanted to appear at ease he kept
+
+playing with a lancet in a way that made me nearly scream. He spoke to
+
+me, Mina, very straightforwardly. He told me how dear I was to him,
+
+though he had known me so little, and what his life would be with me to
+
+help and cheer him. He was going to tell me how unhappy he would be if I
+
+did not care for him, but when he saw me cry he said that he was a brute
+
+and would not add to my present trouble. Then he broke off and asked if
+
+I could love him in time; and when I shook my head his hands trembled,
+
+and then with some hesitation he asked me if I cared already for any one
+
+else. He put it very nicely, saying that he did not want to wring my
+
+confidence from me, but only to know, because if a woman�s heart was
+
+free a man might have hope. And then, Mina, I felt a sort of duty to
+
+tell him that there was some one. I only told him that much, and then he
+
+stood up, and he looked very strong and very grave as he took both my
+
+hands in his and said he hoped I would be happy, and that if I ever
+
+wanted a friend I must count him one of my best. Oh, Mina dear, I can�t
+
+help crying: and you must excuse this letter being all blotted. Being
+
+proposed to is all very nice and all that sort of thing, but it isn�t at
+
+all a happy thing when you have to see a poor fellow, whom you know
+
+loves you honestly, going away and looking all broken-hearted, and to
+
+know that, no matter what he may say at the moment, you are passing
+
+quite out of his life. My dear, I must stop here at present, I feel so
+
+miserable, though I am so happy.
+
+�_Evening._
+
+�Arthur has just gone, and I feel in better spirits than when I left
+
+off, so I can go on telling you about the day. Well, my dear, number Two
+
+came after lunch. He is such a nice fellow, an American from Texas, and
+
+he looks so young and so fresh that it seems almost impossible that he
+
+has been to so many places and has had such adventures. I sympathise
+
+with poor Desdemona when she had such a dangerous stream poured in her
+
+ear, even by a black man. I suppose that we women are such cowards that
+
+we think a man will save us from fears, and we marry him. I know now
+
+what I would do if I were a man and wanted to make a girl love me. No, I
+
+don�t, for there was Mr. Morris telling us his stories, and Arthur never
+
+told any, and yet---- My dear, I am somewhat previous. Mr. Quincey P.
+
+Morris found me alone. It seems that a man always does find a girl
+
+alone. No, he doesn�t, for Arthur tried twice to _make_ a chance, and I
+
+helping him all I could; I am not ashamed to say it now. I must tell you
+
+beforehand that Mr. Morris doesn�t always speak slang--that is to say,
+
+he never does so to strangers or before them, for he is really well
+
+educated and has exquisite manners--but he found out that it amused me
+
+to hear him talk American slang, and whenever I was present, and there
+
+was no one to be shocked, he said such funny things. I am afraid, my
+
+dear, he has to invent it all, for it fits exactly into whatever else he
+
+has to say. But this is a way slang has. I do not know myself if I shall
+
+ever speak slang; I do not know if Arthur likes it, as I have never
+
+heard him use any as yet. Well, Mr. Morris sat down beside me and looked
+
+as happy and jolly as he could, but I could see all the same that he was
+
+very nervous. He took my hand in his, and said ever so sweetly:--
+
+��Miss Lucy, I know I ain�t good enough to regulate the fixin�s of your
+
+little shoes, but I guess if you wait till you find a man that is you
+
+will go join them seven young women with the lamps when you quit. Won�t
+
+you just hitch up alongside of me and let us go down the long road
+
+together, driving in double harness?�
+
+�Well, he did look so good-humoured and so jolly that it didn�t seem
+
+half so hard to refuse him as it did poor Dr. Seward; so I said, as
+
+lightly as I could, that I did not know anything of hitching, and that I
+
+wasn�t broken to harness at all yet. Then he said that he had spoken in
+
+a light manner, and he hoped that if he had made a mistake in doing so
+
+on so grave, so momentous, an occasion for him, I would forgive him. He
+
+really did look serious when he was saying it, and I couldn�t help
+
+feeling a bit serious too--I know, Mina, you will think me a horrid
+
+flirt--though I couldn�t help feeling a sort of exultation that he was
+
+number two in one day. And then, my dear, before I could say a word he
+
+began pouring out a perfect torrent of love-making, laying his very
+
+heart and soul at my feet. He looked so earnest over it that I shall
+
+never again think that a man must be playful always, and never earnest,
+
+because he is merry at times. I suppose he saw something in my face
+
+which checked him, for he suddenly stopped, and said with a sort of
+
+manly fervour that I could have loved him for if I had been free:--
+
+��Lucy, you are an honest-hearted girl, I know. I should not be here
+
+speaking to you as I am now if I did not believe you clean grit, right
+
+through to the very depths of your soul. Tell me, like one good fellow
+
+to another, is there any one else that you care for? And if there is
+
+I�ll never trouble you a hair�s breadth again, but will be, if you will
+
+let me, a very faithful friend.�
+
+�My dear Mina, why are men so noble when we women are so little worthy
+
+of them? Here was I almost making fun of this great-hearted, true
+
+gentleman. I burst into tears--I am afraid, my dear, you will think
+
+this a very sloppy letter in more ways than one--and I really felt very
+
+badly. Why can�t they let a girl marry three men, or as many as want
+
+her, and save all this trouble? But this is heresy, and I must not say
+
+it. I am glad to say that, though I was crying, I was able to look into
+
+Mr. Morris�s brave eyes, and I told him out straight:--
+
+��Yes, there is some one I love, though he has not told me yet that he
+
+even loves me.� I was right to speak to him so frankly, for quite a
+
+light came into his face, and he put out both his hands and took mine--I
+
+think I put them into his--and said in a hearty way:--
+
+��That�s my brave girl. It�s better worth being late for a chance of
+
+winning you than being in time for any other girl in the world. Don�t
+
+cry, my dear. If it�s for me, I�m a hard nut to crack; and I take it
+
+standing up. If that other fellow doesn�t know his happiness, well, he�d
+
+better look for it soon, or he�ll have to deal with me. Little girl,
+
+your honesty and pluck have made me a friend, and that�s rarer than a
+
+lover; it�s more unselfish anyhow. My dear, I�m going to have a pretty
+
+lonely walk between this and Kingdom Come. Won�t you give me one kiss?
+
+It�ll be something to keep off the darkness now and then. You can, you
+
+know, if you like, for that other good fellow--he must be a good fellow,
+
+my dear, and a fine fellow, or you could not love him--hasn�t spoken
+
+yet.� That quite won me, Mina, for it _was_ brave and sweet of him, and
+
+noble, too, to a rival--wasn�t it?--and he so sad; so I leant over and
+
+kissed him. He stood up with my two hands in his, and as he looked down
+
+into my face--I am afraid I was blushing very much--he said:--
+
+��Little girl, I hold your hand, and you�ve kissed me, and if these
+
+things don�t make us friends nothing ever will. Thank you for your sweet
+
+honesty to me, and good-bye.� He wrung my hand, and taking up his hat,
+
+went straight out of the room without looking back, without a tear or a
+
+quiver or a pause; and I am crying like a baby. Oh, why must a man like
+
+that be made unhappy when there are lots of girls about who would
+
+worship the very ground he trod on? I know I would if I were free--only
+
+I don�t want to be free. My dear, this quite upset me, and I feel I
+
+cannot write of happiness just at once, after telling you of it; and I
+
+don�t wish to tell of the number three until it can be all happy.
+
+�Ever your loving
+
+�LUCY.
+
+�P.S.--Oh, about number Three--I needn�t tell you of number Three, need
+
+I? Besides, it was all so confused; it seemed only a moment from his
+
+coming into the room till both his arms were round me, and he was
+
+kissing me. I am very, very happy, and I don�t know what I have done to
+
+deserve it. I must only try in the future to show that I am not
+
+ungrateful to God for all His goodness to me in sending to me such a
+
+lover, such a husband, and such a friend.
+
+�Good-bye.�

+
+_25 May._--Ebb tide in appetite to-day. Cannot eat, cannot rest, so
+
+diary instead. Since my rebuff of yesterday I have a sort of empty
+
+feeling; nothing in the world seems of sufficient importance to be worth
+
+the doing.... As I knew that the only cure for this sort of thing was
+
+work, I went down amongst the patients. I picked out one who has
+
+afforded me a study of much interest. He is so quaint that I am
+
+determined to understand him as well as I can. To-day I seemed to get
+
+nearer than ever before to the heart of his mystery.
+
+I questioned him more fully than I had ever done, with a view to making
+
+myself master of the facts of his hallucination. In my manner of doing
+
+it there was, I now see, something of cruelty. I seemed to wish to keep
+
+him to the point of his madness--a thing which I avoid with the patients
+
+as I would the mouth of hell.
+
+(_Mem._, under what circumstances would I _not_ avoid the pit of hell?)
+
+_Omnia Rom� venalia sunt._ Hell has its price! _verb. sap._ If there be
+
+anything behind this instinct it will be valuable to trace it afterwards
+
+_accurately_, so I had better commence to do so, therefore--

+R. M. Renfield, �tat 59.--Sanguine temperament; great physical strength;
+
+morbidly excitable; periods of gloom, ending in some fixed idea which I
+
+cannot make out. I presume that the sanguine temperament itself and the
+
+disturbing influence end in a mentally-accomplished finish; a possibly
+
+dangerous man, probably dangerous if unselfish. In selfish men caution
+
+is as secure an armour for their foes as for themselves. What I think of
+
+on this point is, when self is the fixed point the centripetal force is
+
+balanced with the centrifugal; when duty, a cause, etc., is the fixed
+
+point, the latter force is paramount, and only accident or a series of
+
+accidents can balance it.

+
+�My dear Art,--
+
+�We�ve told yarns by the camp-fire in the prairies; and dressed one
+
+another�s wounds after trying a landing at the Marquesas; and drunk
+
+healths on the shore of Titicaca. There are more yarns to be told, and
+
+other wounds to be healed, and another health to be drunk. Won�t you let
+
+this be at my camp-fire to-morrow night? I have no hesitation in asking
+
+you, as I know a certain lady is engaged to a certain dinner-party, and
+
+that you are free. There will only be one other, our old pal at the
+
+Korea, Jack Seward. He�s coming, too, and we both want to mingle our
+
+weeps over the wine-cup, and to drink a health with all our hearts to
+
+the happiest man in all the wide world, who has won the noblest heart
+
+that God has made and the best worth winning. We promise you a hearty
+
+welcome, and a loving greeting, and a health as true as your own right
+
+hand. We shall both swear to leave you at home if you drink too deep to
+
+a certain pair of eyes. Come!

+CHAPTER XXVI
+
+DR. SEWARD�S DIARY
+
+_29 October._--This is written in the train from Varna to Galatz. Last
+
+night we all assembled a little before the time of sunset. Each of us
+
+had done his work as well as he could; so far as thought, and endeavour,
+
+and opportunity go, we are prepared for the whole of our journey, and
+
+for our work when we get to Galatz. When the usual time came round Mrs.
+
+Harker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort; and after a longer and
+
+more serious effort on the part of Van Helsing than has been usually
+
+necessary, she sank into the trance. Usually she speaks on a hint; but
+
+this time the Professor had to ask her questions, and to ask them pretty
+
+resolutely, before we could learn anything; at last her answer came:--
+
+�I can see nothing; we are still; there are no waves lapping, but only a
+
+steady swirl of water softly running against the hawser. I can hear
+
+men�s voices calling, near and far, and the roll and creak of oars in
+
+the rowlocks. A gun is fired somewhere; the echo of it seems far away.
+
+There is tramping of feet overhead, and ropes and chains are dragged
+
+along. What is this? There is a gleam of light; I can feel the air
+
+blowing upon me.�
+
+Here she stopped. She had risen, as if impulsively, from where she lay
+
+on the sofa, and raised both her hands, palms upwards, as if lifting a
+
+weight. Van Helsing and I looked at each other with understanding.
+
+Quincey raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at her intently, whilst
+
+Harker�s hand instinctively closed round the hilt of his Kukri. There
+
+was a long pause. We all knew that the time when she could speak was
+
+passing; but we felt that it was useless to say anything. Suddenly she
+
+sat up, and, as she opened her eyes, said sweetly:--
+
+�Would none of you like a cup of tea? You must all be so tired!� We
+
+could only make her happy, and so acquiesced. She bustled off to get
+
+tea; when she had gone Van Helsing said:--
+
+�You see, my friends. _He_ is close to land: he has left his
+
+earth-chest. But he has yet to get on shore. In the night he may lie
+
+hidden somewhere; but if he be not carried on shore, or if the ship do
+
+not touch it, he cannot achieve the land. In such case he can, if it be
+
+in the night, change his form and can jump or fly on shore, as he did
+
+at Whitby. But if the day come before he get on shore, then, unless he
+
+be carried he cannot escape. And if he be carried, then the customs men
+
+may discover what the box contain. Thus, in fine, if he escape not on
+
+shore to-night, or before dawn, there will be the whole day lost to him.
+
+We may then arrive in time; for if he escape not at night we shall come
+
+on him in daytime, boxed up and at our mercy; for he dare not be his
+
+true self, awake and visible, lest he be discovered.�
+
+There was no more to be said, so we waited in patience until the dawn;
+
+at which time we might learn more from Mrs. Harker.
+
+Early this morning we listened, with breathless anxiety, for her
+
+response in her trance. The hypnotic stage was even longer in coming
+
+than before; and when it came the time remaining until full sunrise was
+
+so short that we began to despair. Van Helsing seemed to throw his whole
+
+soul into the effort; at last, in obedience to his will she made
+
+reply:--
+
+�All is dark. I hear lapping water, level with me, and some creaking as
+
+of wood on wood.� She paused, and the red sun shot up. We must wait till
+
+to-night.
+
+And so it is that we are travelling towards Galatz in an agony of
+
+expectation. We are due to arrive between two and three in the morning;
+
+but already, at Bucharest, we are three hours late, so we cannot
+
+possibly get in till well after sun-up. Thus we shall have two more
+
+hypnotic messages from Mrs. Harker; either or both may possibly throw
+
+more light on what is happening.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_Later._--Sunset has come and gone. Fortunately it came at a time when
+
+there was no distraction; for had it occurred whilst we were at a
+
+station, we might not have secured the necessary calm and isolation.
+
+Mrs. Harker yielded to the hypnotic influence even less readily than
+
+this morning. I am in fear that her power of reading the Count�s
+
+sensations may die away, just when we want it most. It seems to me that
+
+her imagination is beginning to work. Whilst she has been in the trance
+
+hitherto she has confined herself to the simplest of facts. If this goes
+
+on it may ultimately mislead us. If I thought that the Count�s power
+
+over her would die away equally with her power of knowledge it would be
+
+a happy thought; but I am afraid that it may not be so. When she did
+
+speak, her words were enigmatical:--
+
+�Something is going out; I can feel it pass me like a cold wind. I can
+
+hear, far off, confused sounds--as of men talking in strange tongues,
+
+fierce-falling water, and the howling of wolves.� She stopped and a
+
+shudder ran through her, increasing in intensity for a few seconds,
+
+till, at the end, she shook as though in a palsy. She said no more, even
+
+in answer to the Professor�s imperative questioning. When she woke from
+
+the trance, she was cold, and exhausted, and languid; but her mind was
+
+all alert. She could not remember anything, but asked what she had said;
+
+when she was told, she pondered over it deeply for a long time and in
+
+silence.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_30 October, 7 a. m._--We are near Galatz now, and I may not have time
+
+to write later. Sunrise this morning was anxiously looked for by us all.
+
+Knowing of the increasing difficulty of procuring the hypnotic trance,
+
+Van Helsing began his passes earlier than usual. They produced no
+
+effect, however, until the regular time, when she yielded with a still
+
+greater difficulty, only a minute before the sun rose. The Professor
+
+lost no time in his questioning; her answer came with equal quickness:--
+
+�All is dark. I hear water swirling by, level with my ears, and the
+
+creaking of wood on wood. Cattle low far off. There is another sound, a
+
+queer one like----� She stopped and grew white, and whiter still.
+
+�Go on; go on! Speak, I command you!� said Van Helsing in an agonised
+
+voice. At the same time there was despair in his eyes, for the risen sun
+
+was reddening even Mrs. Harker�s pale face. She opened her eyes, and we
+
+all started as she said, sweetly and seemingly with the utmost
+
+unconcern:--
+
+�Oh, Professor, why ask me to do what you know I can�t? I don�t remember
+
+anything.� Then, seeing the look of amazement on our faces, she said,
+
+turning from one to the other with a troubled look:--
+
+�What have I said? What have I done? I know nothing, only that I was
+
+lying here, half asleep, and heard you say �go on! speak, I command you!�
+
+It seemed so funny to hear you order me about, as if I were a bad
+
+child!�
+
+�Oh, Madam Mina,� he said, sadly, �it is proof, if proof be needed, of
+
+how I love and honour you, when a word for your good, spoken more
+
+earnest than ever, can seem so strange because it is to order her whom I
+
+am proud to obey!�
+
+The whistles are sounding; we are nearing Galatz. We are on fire with
+
+anxiety and eagerness.
+
+_Mina Harker�s Journal._
+
+_30 October._--Mr. Morris took me to the hotel where our rooms had been
+
+ordered by telegraph, he being the one who could best be spared, since
+
+he does not speak any foreign language. The forces were distributed
+
+much as they had been at Varna, except that Lord Godalming went to the
+
+Vice-Consul, as his rank might serve as an immediate guarantee of some
+
+sort to the official, we being in extreme hurry. Jonathan and the two
+
+doctors went to the shipping agent to learn particulars of the arrival
+
+of the _Czarina Catherine_.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_Later._--Lord Godalming has returned. The Consul is away, and the
+
+Vice-Consul sick; so the routine work has been attended to by a clerk.
+
+He was very obliging, and offered to do anything in his power.
+
+_Jonathan Harker�s Journal._
+
+_30 October._--At nine o�clock Dr. Van Helsing, Dr. Seward, and I called
+
+on Messrs. Mackenzie & Steinkoff, the agents of the London firm of
+
+Hapgood. They had received a wire from London, in answer to Lord
+
+Godalming�s telegraphed request, asking us to show them any civility in
+
+their power. They were more than kind and courteous, and took us at once
+
+on board the _Czarina Catherine_, which lay at anchor out in the river
+
+harbour. There we saw the Captain, Donelson by name, who told us of his
+
+voyage. He said that in all his life he had never had so favourable a
+
+run.
+
+�Man!� he said, �but it made us afeard, for we expeckit that we should
+
+have to pay for it wi� some rare piece o� ill luck, so as to keep up the
+
+average. It�s no canny to run frae London to the Black Sea wi� a wind
+
+ahint ye, as though the Deil himself were blawin� on yer sail for his
+
+ain purpose. An� a� the time we could no speer a thing. Gin we were nigh
+
+a ship, or a port, or a headland, a fog fell on us and travelled wi� us,
+
+till when after it had lifted and we looked out, the deil a thing could
+
+we see. We ran by Gibraltar wi�oot bein� able to signal; an� till we
+
+came to the Dardanelles and had to wait to get our permit to pass, we
+
+never were within hail o� aught. At first I inclined to slack off sail
+
+and beat about till the fog was lifted; but whiles, I thocht that if the
+
+Deil was minded to get us into the Black Sea quick, he was like to do it
+
+whether we would or no. If we had a quick voyage it would be no to our
+
+miscredit wi� the owners, or no hurt to our traffic; an� the Old Mon who
+
+had served his ain purpose wad be decently grateful to us for no
+
+hinderin� him.� This mixture of simplicity and cunning, of superstition
+
+and commercial reasoning, aroused Van Helsing, who said:--
+
+�Mine friend, that Devil is more clever than he is thought by some; and
+
+he know when he meet his match!� The skipper was not displeased with the
+
+compliment, and went on:--
+
+�When we got past the Bosphorus the men began to grumble; some o� them,
+
+the Roumanians, came and asked me to heave overboard a big box which had
+
+been put on board by a queer lookin� old man just before we had started
+
+frae London. I had seen them speer at the fellow, and put out their twa
+
+fingers when they saw him, to guard against the evil eye. Man! but the
+
+supersteetion of foreigners is pairfectly rideeculous! I sent them aboot
+
+their business pretty quick; but as just after a fog closed in on us I
+
+felt a wee bit as they did anent something, though I wouldn�t say it was
+
+agin the big box. Well, on we went, and as the fog didn�t let up for
+
+five days I joost let the wind carry us; for if the Deil wanted to get
+
+somewheres--well, he would fetch it up a�reet. An� if he didn�t, well,
+
+we�d keep a sharp lookout anyhow. Sure eneuch, we had a fair way and
+
+deep water all the time; and two days ago, when the mornin� sun came
+
+through the fog, we found ourselves just in the river opposite Galatz.
+
+The Roumanians were wild, and wanted me right or wrong to take out the
+
+box and fling it in the river. I had to argy wi� them aboot it wi� a
+
+handspike; an� when the last o� them rose off the deck wi� his head in
+
+his hand, I had convinced them that, evil eye or no evil eye, the
+
+property and the trust of my owners were better in my hands than in the
+
+river Danube. They had, mind ye, taken the box on the deck ready to
+
+fling in, and as it was marked Galatz _via_ Varna, I thocht I�d let it
+
+lie till we discharged in the port an� get rid o�t althegither. We
+
+didn�t do much clearin� that day, an� had to remain the nicht at anchor;
+
+but in the mornin�, braw an� airly, an hour before sun-up, a man came
+
+aboard wi� an order, written to him from England, to receive a box
+
+marked for one Count Dracula. Sure eneuch the matter was one ready to
+
+his hand. He had his papers a� reet, an� glad I was to be rid o� the
+
+dam� thing, for I was beginnin� masel� to feel uneasy at it. If the Deil
+
+did have any luggage aboord the ship, I�m thinkin� it was nane ither
+
+than that same!�
+
+�What was the name of the man who took it?� asked Dr. Van Helsing with
+
+restrained eagerness.
+
+�I�ll be tellin� ye quick!� he answered, and, stepping down to his
+
+cabin, produced a receipt signed �Immanuel Hildesheim.� Burgen-strasse
+
+16 was the address. We found out that this was all the Captain knew; so
+
+with thanks we came away.
+
+We found Hildesheim in his office, a Hebrew of rather the Adelphi
+
+Theatre type, with a nose like a sheep, and a fez. His arguments were
+
+pointed with specie--we doing the punctuation--and with a little
+
+bargaining he told us what he knew. This turned out to be simple but
+
+important. He had received a letter from Mr. de Ville of London, telling
+
+him to receive, if possible before sunrise so as to avoid customs, a box
+
+which would arrive at Galatz in the _Czarina Catherine_. This he was to
+
+give in charge to a certain Petrof Skinsky, who dealt with the Slovaks
+
+who traded down the river to the port. He had been paid for his work by
+
+an English bank note, which had been duly cashed for gold at the Danube
+
+International Bank. When Skinsky had come to him, he had taken him to
+
+the ship and handed over the box, so as to save porterage. That was all
+
+he knew.
+
+We then sought for Skinsky, but were unable to find him. One of his
+
+neighbours, who did not seem to bear him any affection, said that he had
+
+gone away two days before, no one knew whither. This was corroborated by
+
+his landlord, who had received by messenger the key of the house
+
+together with the rent due, in English money. This had been between ten
+
+and eleven o�clock last night. We were at a standstill again.
+
+Whilst we were talking one came running and breathlessly gasped out that
+
+the body of Skinsky had been found inside the wall of the churchyard of
+
+St. Peter, and that the throat had been torn open as if by some wild
+
+animal. Those we had been speaking with ran off to see the horror, the
+
+women crying out �This is the work of a Slovak!� We hurried away lest we
+
+should have been in some way drawn into the affair, and so detained.
+
+As we came home we could arrive at no definite conclusion. We were all
+
+convinced that the box was on its way, by water, to somewhere; but where
+
+that might be we would have to discover. With heavy hearts we came home
+
+to the hotel to Mina.
+
+When we met together, the first thing was to consult as to taking Mina
+
+again into our confidence. Things are getting desperate, and it is at
+
+least a chance, though a hazardous one. As a preliminary step, I was
+
+released from my promise to her.
+
+_Mina Harker�s Journal._
+
+_30 October, evening._--They were so tired and worn out and dispirited
+
+that there was nothing to be done till they had some rest; so I asked
+
+them all to lie down for half an hour whilst I should enter everything
+
+up to the moment. I feel so grateful to the man who invented the
+
+�Traveller�s� typewriter, and to Mr. Morris for getting this one for
+
+me. I should have felt quite astray doing the work if I had to write
+
+with a pen....
+
+It is all done; poor dear, dear Jonathan, what he must have suffered,
+
+what must he be suffering now. He lies on the sofa hardly seeming to
+
+breathe, and his whole body appears in collapse. His brows are knit; his
+
+face is drawn with pain. Poor fellow, maybe he is thinking, and I can
+
+see his face all wrinkled up with the concentration of his thoughts. Oh!
+
+if I could only help at all.... I shall do what I can.
+
+I have asked Dr. Van Helsing, and he has got me all the papers that I
+
+have not yet seen.... Whilst they are resting, I shall go over all
+
+carefully, and perhaps I may arrive at some conclusion. I shall try to
+
+follow the Professor�s example, and think without prejudice on the facts
+
+before me....
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+I do believe that under God�s providence I have made a discovery. I
+
+shall get the maps and look over them....
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+I am more than ever sure that I am right. My new conclusion is ready, so
+
+I shall get our party together and read it. They can judge it; it is
+
+well to be accurate, and every minute is precious.
+
+_Mina Harker�s Memorandum._
+
+(Entered in her Journal.)
+
+_Ground of inquiry._--Count Dracula�s problem is to get back to his own
+
+place.
+
+(_a_) He must be _brought back_ by some one. This is evident; for had he
+
+power to move himself as he wished he could go either as man, or wolf,
+
+or bat, or in some other way. He evidently fears discovery or
+
+interference, in the state of helplessness in which he must be--confined
+
+as he is between dawn and sunset in his wooden box.
+
+(_b_) _How is he to be taken?_--Here a process of exclusions may help
+
+us. By road, by rail, by water?
+
+1. _By Road._--There are endless difficulties, especially in leaving the
+
+city.
+
+(_x_) There are people; and people are curious, and investigate. A hint,
+
+a surmise, a doubt as to what might be in the box, would destroy him.
+
+(_y_) There are, or there may be, customs and octroi officers to pass.
+
+(_z_) His pursuers might follow. This is his highest fear; and in order
+
+to prevent his being betrayed he has repelled, so far as he can, even
+
+his victim--me!
+
+2. _By Rail._--There is no one in charge of the box. It would have to
+
+take its chance of being delayed; and delay would be fatal, with enemies
+
+on the track. True, he might escape at night; but what would he be, if
+
+left in a strange place with no refuge that he could fly to? This is not
+
+what he intends; and he does not mean to risk it.
+
+3. _By Water._--Here is the safest way, in one respect, but with most
+
+danger in another. On the water he is powerless except at night; even
+
+then he can only summon fog and storm and snow and his wolves. But were
+
+he wrecked, the living water would engulf him, helpless; and he would
+
+indeed be lost. He could have the vessel drive to land; but if it were
+
+unfriendly land, wherein he was not free to move, his position would
+
+still be desperate.
+
+We know from the record that he was on the water; so what we have to do
+
+is to ascertain _what_ water.
+
+The first thing is to realise exactly what he has done as yet; we may,
+
+then, get a light on what his later task is to be.
+
+_Firstly._--We must differentiate between what he did in London as part
+
+of his general plan of action, when he was pressed for moments and had
+
+to arrange as best he could.
+
+_Secondly_ we must see, as well as we can surmise it from the facts we
+
+know of, what he has done here.
+
+As to the first, he evidently intended to arrive at Galatz, and sent
+
+invoice to Varna to deceive us lest we should ascertain his means of
+
+exit from England; his immediate and sole purpose then was to escape.
+
+The proof of this, is the letter of instructions sent to Immanuel
+
+Hildesheim to clear and take away the box _before sunrise_. There is
+
+also the instruction to Petrof Skinsky. These we must only guess at; but
+
+there must have been some letter or message, since Skinsky came to
+
+Hildesheim.
+
+That, so far, his plans were successful we know. The _Czarina Catherine_
+
+made a phenomenally quick journey--so much so that Captain Donelson�s
+
+suspicions were aroused; but his superstition united with his canniness
+
+played the Count�s game for him, and he ran with his favouring wind
+
+through fogs and all till he brought up blindfold at Galatz. That the
+
+Count�s arrangements were well made, has been proved. Hildesheim cleared
+
+the box, took it off, and gave it to Skinsky. Skinsky took it--and here
+
+we lose the trail. We only know that the box is somewhere on the water,
+
+moving along. The customs and the octroi, if there be any, have been
+
+avoided.
+
+Now we come to what the Count must have done after his arrival--_on
+
+land_, at Galatz.
+
+The box was given to Skinsky before sunrise. At sunrise the Count could
+
+appear in his own form. Here, we ask why Skinsky was chosen at all to
+
+aid in the work? In my husband�s diary, Skinsky is mentioned as dealing
+
+with the Slovaks who trade down the river to the port; and the man�s
+
+remark, that the murder was the work of a Slovak, showed the general
+
+feeling against his class. The Count wanted isolation.
+
+My surmise is, this: that in London the Count decided to get back to his
+
+castle by water, as the most safe and secret way. He was brought from
+
+the castle by Szgany, and probably they delivered their cargo to Slovaks
+
+who took the boxes to Varna, for there they were shipped for London.
+
+Thus the Count had knowledge of the persons who could arrange this
+
+service. When the box was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, he
+
+came out from his box, met Skinsky and instructed him what to do as to
+
+arranging the carriage of the box up some river. When this was done, and
+
+he knew that all was in train, he blotted out his traces, as he thought,
+
+by murdering his agent.
+
+I have examined the map and find that the river most suitable for the
+
+Slovaks to have ascended is either the Pruth or the Sereth. I read in
+
+the typescript that in my trance I heard cows low and water swirling
+
+level with my ears and the creaking of wood. The Count in his box, then,
+
+was on a river in an open boat--propelled probably either by oars or
+
+poles, for the banks are near and it is working against stream. There
+
+would be no such sound if floating down stream.
+
+Of course it may not be either the Sereth or the Pruth, but we may
+
+possibly investigate further. Now of these two, the Pruth is the more
+
+easily navigated, but the Sereth is, at Fundu, joined by the Bistritza
+
+which runs up round the Borgo Pass. The loop it makes is manifestly as
+
+close to Dracula�s castle as can be got by water.
+
+_Mina Harker�s Journal--continued._
+
+When I had done reading, Jonathan took me in his arms and kissed me. The
+
+others kept shaking me by both hands, and Dr. Van Helsing said:--
+
+�Our dear Madam Mina is once more our teacher. Her eyes have been where
+
+we were blinded. Now we are on the track once again, and this time we
+
+may succeed. Our enemy is at his most helpless; and if we can come on
+
+him by day, on the water, our task will be over. He has a start, but he
+
+is powerless to hasten, as he may not leave his box lest those who carry
+
+him may suspect; for them to suspect would be to prompt them to throw
+
+him in the stream where he perish. This he knows, and will not. Now men,
+
+to our Council of War; for, here and now, we must plan what each and all
+
+shall do.�
+
+�I shall get a steam launch and follow him,� said Lord Godalming.
+
+�And I, horses to follow on the bank lest by chance he land,� said Mr.
+
+Morris.
+
+�Good!� said the Professor, �both good. But neither must go alone. There
+
+must be force to overcome force if need be; the Slovak is strong and
+
+rough, and he carries rude arms.� All the men smiled, for amongst them
+
+they carried a small arsenal. Said Mr. Morris:--
+
+�I have brought some Winchesters; they are pretty handy in a crowd, and
+
+there may be wolves. The Count, if you remember, took some other
+
+precautions; he made some requisitions on others that Mrs. Harker could
+
+not quite hear or understand. We must be ready at all points.� Dr.
+
+Seward said:--
+
+�I think I had better go with Quincey. We have been accustomed to hunt
+
+together, and we two, well armed, will be a match for whatever may come
+
+along. You must not be alone, Art. It may be necessary to fight the
+
+Slovaks, and a chance thrust--for I don�t suppose these fellows carry
+
+guns--would undo all our plans. There must be no chances, this time; we
+
+shall not rest until the Count�s head and body have been separated, and
+
+we are sure that he cannot re-incarnate.� He looked at Jonathan as he
+
+spoke, and Jonathan looked at me. I could see that the poor dear was
+
+torn about in his mind. Of course he wanted to be with me; but then the
+
+boat service would, most likely, be the one which would destroy the ...
+
+the ... the ... Vampire. (Why did I hesitate to write the word?) He was
+
+silent awhile, and during his silence Dr. Van Helsing spoke:--
+
+�Friend Jonathan, this is to you for twice reasons. First, because you
+
+are young and brave and can fight, and all energies may be needed at the
+
+last; and again that it is your right to destroy him--that--which has
+
+wrought such woe to you and yours. Be not afraid for Madam Mina; she
+
+will be my care, if I may. I am old. My legs are not so quick to run as
+
+once; and I am not used to ride so long or to pursue as need be, or to
+
+fight with lethal weapons. But I can be of other service; I can fight in
+
+other way. And I can die, if need be, as well as younger men. Now let
+
+me say that what I would is this: while you, my Lord Godalming and
+
+friend Jonathan go in your so swift little steamboat up the river, and
+
+whilst John and Quincey guard the bank where perchance he might be
+
+landed, I will take Madam Mina right into the heart of the enemy�s
+
+country. Whilst the old fox is tied in his box, floating on the running
+
+stream whence he cannot escape to land--where he dares not raise the lid
+
+of his coffin-box lest his Slovak carriers should in fear leave him to
+
+perish--we shall go in the track where Jonathan went,--from Bistritz
+
+over the Borgo, and find our way to the Castle of Dracula. Here, Madam
+
+Mina�s hypnotic power will surely help, and we shall find our way--all
+
+dark and unknown otherwise--after the first sunrise when we are near
+
+that fateful place. There is much to be done, and other places to be
+
+made sanctify, so that that nest of vipers be obliterated.� Here
+
+Jonathan interrupted him hotly:--
+
+�Do you mean to say, Professor Van Helsing, that you would bring Mina,
+
+in her sad case and tainted as she is with that devil�s illness, right
+
+into the jaws of his death-trap? Not for the world! Not for Heaven or
+
+Hell!� He became almost speechless for a minute, and then went on:--
+
+�Do you know what the place is? Have you seen that awful den of hellish
+
+infamy--with the very moonlight alive with grisly shapes, and every
+
+speck of dust that whirls in the wind a devouring monster in embryo?
+
+Have you felt the Vampire�s lips upon your throat?� Here he turned to
+
+me, and as his eyes lit on my forehead he threw up his arms with a cry:
+
+�Oh, my God, what have we done to have this terror upon us!� and he sank
+
+down on the sofa in a collapse of misery. The Professor�s voice, as he
+
+spoke in clear, sweet tones, which seemed to vibrate in the air, calmed
+
+us all:--
+
+�Oh, my friend, it is because I would save Madam Mina from that awful
+
+place that I would go. God forbid that I should take her into that
+
+place. There is work--wild work--to be done there, that her eyes may not
+
+see. We men here, all save Jonathan, have seen with their own eyes what
+
+is to be done before that place can be purify. Remember that we are in
+
+terrible straits. If the Count escape us this time--and he is strong and
+
+subtle and cunning--he may choose to sleep him for a century, and then
+
+in time our dear one�--he took my hand--�would come to him to keep him
+
+company, and would be as those others that you, Jonathan, saw. You have
+
+told us of their gloating lips; you heard their ribald laugh as they
+
+clutched the moving bag that the Count threw to them. You shudder; and
+
+well may it be. Forgive me that I make you so much pain, but it is
+
+necessary. My friend, is it not a dire need for the which I am giving,
+
+possibly my life? If it were that any one went into that place to stay,
+
+it is I who would have to go to keep them company.�
+
+�Do as you will,� said Jonathan, with a sob that shook him all over, �we
+
+are in the hands of God!�
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_Later._--Oh, it did me good to see the way that these brave men worked.
+
+How can women help loving men when they are so earnest, and so true, and
+
+so brave! And, too, it made me think of the wonderful power of money!
+
+What can it not do when it is properly applied; and what might it do
+
+when basely used. I felt so thankful that Lord Godalming is rich, and
+
+that both he and Mr. Morris, who also has plenty of money, are willing
+
+to spend it so freely. For if they did not, our little expedition could
+
+not start, either so promptly or so well equipped, as it will within
+
+another hour. It is not three hours since it was arranged what part each
+
+of us was to do; and now Lord Godalming and Jonathan have a lovely steam
+
+launch, with steam up ready to start at a moment�s notice. Dr. Seward
+
+and Mr. Morris have half a dozen good horses, well appointed. We have
+
+all the maps and appliances of various kinds that can be had. Professor
+
+Van Helsing and I are to leave by the 11:40 train to-night for Veresti,
+
+where we are to get a carriage to drive to the Borgo Pass. We are
+
+bringing a good deal of ready money, as we are to buy a carriage and
+
+horses. We shall drive ourselves, for we have no one whom we can trust
+
+in the matter. The Professor knows something of a great many languages,
+
+so we shall get on all right. We have all got arms, even for me a
+
+large-bore revolver; Jonathan would not be happy unless I was armed like
+
+the rest. Alas! I cannot carry one arm that the rest do; the scar on my
+
+forehead forbids that. Dear Dr. Van Helsing comforts me by telling me
+
+that I am fully armed as there may be wolves; the weather is getting
+
+colder every hour, and there are snow-flurries which come and go as
+
+warnings.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_Later._--It took all my courage to say good-bye to my darling. We may
+
+never meet again. Courage, Mina! the Professor is looking at you keenly;
+
+his look is a warning. There must be no tears now--unless it may be that
+
+God will let them fall in gladness.
+
+_Jonathan Harker�s Journal._
+
+_October 30. Night._--I am writing this in the light from the furnace
+
+door of the steam launch: Lord Godalming is firing up. He is an
+
+experienced hand at the work, as he has had for years a launch of his
+
+own on the Thames, and another on the Norfolk Broads. Regarding our
+
+plans, we finally decided that Mina�s guess was correct, and that if any
+
+waterway was chosen for the Count�s escape back to his Castle, the
+
+Sereth and then the Bistritza at its junction, would be the one. We took
+
+it, that somewhere about the 47th degree, north latitude, would be the
+
+place chosen for the crossing the country between the river and the
+
+Carpathians. We have no fear in running at good speed up the river at
+
+night; there is plenty of water, and the banks are wide enough apart to
+
+make steaming, even in the dark, easy enough. Lord Godalming tells me to
+
+sleep for a while, as it is enough for the present for one to be on
+
+watch. But I cannot sleep--how can I with the terrible danger hanging
+
+over my darling, and her going out into that awful place.... My only
+
+comfort is that we are in the hands of God. Only for that faith it would
+
+be easier to die than to live, and so be quit of all the trouble. Mr.
+
+Morris and Dr. Seward were off on their long ride before we started;
+
+they are to keep up the right bank, far enough off to get on higher
+
+lands where they can see a good stretch of river and avoid the following
+
+of its curves. They have, for the first stages, two men to ride and lead
+
+their spare horses--four in all, so as not to excite curiosity. When
+
+they dismiss the men, which shall be shortly, they shall themselves look
+
+after the horses. It may be necessary for us to join forces; if so they
+
+can mount our whole party. One of the saddles has a movable horn, and
+
+can be easily adapted for Mina, if required.
+
+It is a wild adventure we are on. Here, as we are rushing along through
+
+the darkness, with the cold from the river seeming to rise up and strike
+
+us; with all the mysterious voices of the night around us, it all comes
+
+home. We seem to be drifting into unknown places and unknown ways; into
+
+a whole world of dark and dreadful things. Godalming is shutting the
+
+furnace door....
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_31 October._--Still hurrying along. The day has come, and Godalming is
+
+sleeping. I am on watch. The morning is bitterly cold; the furnace heat
+
+is grateful, though we have heavy fur coats. As yet we have passed only
+
+a few open boats, but none of them had on board any box or package of
+
+anything like the size of the one we seek. The men were scared every
+
+time we turned our electric lamp on them, and fell on their knees and
+
+prayed.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_1 November, evening._--No news all day; we have found nothing of the
+
+kind we seek. We have now passed into the Bistritza; and if we are wrong
+
+in our surmise our chance is gone. We have over-hauled every boat, big
+
+and little. Early this morning, one crew took us for a Government boat,
+
+and treated us accordingly. We saw in this a way of smoothing matters,
+
+so at Fundu, where the Bistritza runs into the Sereth, we got a
+
+Roumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously. With every boat which we
+
+have over-hauled since then this trick has succeeded; we have had every
+
+deference shown to us, and not once any objection to whatever we chose
+
+to ask or do. Some of the Slovaks tell us that a big boat passed them,
+
+going at more than usual speed as she had a double crew on board. This
+
+was before they came to Fundu, so they could not tell us whether the
+
+boat turned into the Bistritza or continued on up the Sereth. At Fundu
+
+we could not hear of any such boat, so she must have passed there in the
+
+night. I am feeling very sleepy; the cold is perhaps beginning to tell
+
+upon me, and nature must have rest some time. Godalming insists that he
+
+shall keep the first watch. God bless him for all his goodness to poor
+
+dear Mina and me.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_2 November, morning._--It is broad daylight. That good fellow would not
+
+wake me. He says it would have been a sin to, for I slept peacefully and
+
+was forgetting my trouble. It seems brutally selfish to me to have slept
+
+so long, and let him watch all night; but he was quite right. I am a new
+
+man this morning; and, as I sit here and watch him sleeping, I can do
+
+all that is necessary both as to minding the engine, steering, and
+
+keeping watch. I can feel that my strength and energy are coming back to
+
+me. I wonder where Mina is now, and Van Helsing. They should have got to
+
+Veresti about noon on Wednesday. It would take them some time to get the
+
+carriage and horses; so if they had started and travelled hard, they
+
+would be about now at the Borgo Pass. God guide and help them! I am
+
+afraid to think what may happen. If we could only go faster! but we
+
+cannot; the engines are throbbing and doing their utmost. I wonder how
+
+Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris are getting on. There seem to be endless
+
+streams running down the mountains into this river, but as none of them
+
+are very large--at present, at all events, though they are terrible
+
+doubtless in winter and when the snow melts--the horsemen may not have
+
+met much obstruction. I hope that before we get to Strasba we may see
+
+them; for if by that time we have not overtaken the Count, it may be
+
+necessary to take counsel together what to do next.
+
+_Dr. Seward�s Diary._
+
+_2 November._--Three days on the road. No news, and no time to write it
+
+if there had been, for every moment is precious. We have had only the
+
+rest needful for the horses; but we are both bearing it wonderfully.
+
+Those adventurous days of ours are turning up useful. We must push on;
+
+we shall never feel happy till we get the launch in sight again.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_3 November._--We heard at Fundu that the launch had gone up the
+
+Bistritza. I wish it wasn�t so cold. There are signs of snow coming; and
+
+if it falls heavy it will stop us. In such case we must get a sledge and
+
+go on, Russian fashion.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_4 November._--To-day we heard of the launch having been detained by an
+
+accident when trying to force a way up the rapids. The Slovak boats get
+
+up all right, by aid of a rope and steering with knowledge. Some went up
+
+only a few hours before. Godalming is an amateur fitter himself, and
+
+evidently it was he who put the launch in trim again. Finally, they got
+
+up the rapids all right, with local help, and are off on the chase
+
+afresh. I fear that the boat is not any better for the accident; the
+
+peasantry tell us that after she got upon smooth water again, she kept
+
+stopping every now and again so long as she was in sight. We must push
+
+on harder than ever; our help may be wanted soon.
+
+_Mina Harker�s Journal._
+
+_31 October._--Arrived at Veresti at noon. The Professor tells me that
+
+this morning at dawn he could hardly hypnotise me at all, and that all I
+
+could say was: �dark and quiet.� He is off now buying a carriage and
+
+horses. He says that he will later on try to buy additional horses, so
+
+that we may be able to change them on the way. We have something more
+
+than 70 miles before us. The country is lovely, and most interesting; if
+
+only we were under different conditions, how delightful it would be to
+
+see it all. If Jonathan and I were driving through it alone what a
+
+pleasure it would be. To stop and see people, and learn something of
+
+their life, and to fill our minds and memories with all the colour and
+
+picturesqueness of the whole wild, beautiful country and the quaint
+
+people! But, alas!--
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_Later._--Dr. Van Helsing has returned. He has got the carriage and
+
+horses; we are to have some dinner, and to start in an hour. The
+
+landlady is putting us up a huge basket of provisions; it seems enough
+
+for a company of soldiers. The Professor encourages her, and whispers to
+
+me that it may be a week before we can get any good food again. He has
+
+been shopping too, and has sent home such a wonderful lot of fur coats
+
+and wraps, and all sorts of warm things. There will not be any chance of
+
+our being cold.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+We shall soon be off. I am afraid to think what may happen to us. We are
+
+truly in the hands of God. He alone knows what may be, and I pray Him,
+
+with all the strength of my sad and humble soul, that He will watch over
+
+my beloved husband; that whatever may happen, Jonathan may know that I
+
+loved him and honoured him more than I can say, and that my latest and
+
+truest thought will be always for him.

+CHAPTER XXI
+
+DR. SEWARD�S DIARY
+
+_3 October._--Let me put down with exactness all that happened, as well
+
+as I can remember it, since last I made an entry. Not a detail that I
+
+can recall must be forgotten; in all calmness I must proceed.
+
+When I came to Renfield�s room I found him lying on the floor on his
+
+left side in a glittering pool of blood. When I went to move him, it
+
+became at once apparent that he had received some terrible injuries;
+
+there seemed none of that unity of purpose between the parts of the body
+
+which marks even lethargic sanity. As the face was exposed I could see
+
+that it was horribly bruised, as though it had been beaten against the
+
+floor--indeed it was from the face wounds that the pool of blood
+
+originated. The attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to me as
+
+we turned him over:--
+
+�I think, sir, his back is broken. See, both his right arm and leg and
+
+the whole side of his face are paralysed.� How such a thing could have
+
+happened puzzled the attendant beyond measure. He seemed quite
+
+bewildered, and his brows were gathered in as he said:--
+
+�I can�t understand the two things. He could mark his face like that by
+
+beating his own head on the floor. I saw a young woman do it once at the
+
+Eversfield Asylum before anyone could lay hands on her. And I suppose he
+
+might have broke his neck by falling out of bed, if he got in an awkward
+
+kink. But for the life of me I can�t imagine how the two things
+
+occurred. If his back was broke, he couldn�t beat his head; and if his
+
+face was like that before the fall out of bed, there would be marks of
+
+it.� I said to him:--
+
+�Go to Dr. Van Helsing, and ask him to kindly come here at once. I want
+
+him without an instant�s delay.� The man ran off, and within a few
+
+minutes the Professor, in his dressing gown and slippers, appeared. When
+
+he saw Renfield on the ground, he looked keenly at him a moment, and
+
+then turned to me. I think he recognised my thought in my eyes, for he
+
+said very quietly, manifestly for the ears of the attendant:--
+
+�Ah, a sad accident! He will need very careful watching, and much
+
+attention. I shall stay with you myself; but I shall first dress myself.
+
+If you will remain I shall in a few minutes join you.�
+
+The patient was now breathing stertorously and it was easy to see that
+
+he had suffered some terrible injury. Van Helsing returned with
+
+extraordinary celerity, bearing with him a surgical case. He had
+
+evidently been thinking and had his mind made up; for, almost before he
+
+looked at the patient, he whispered to me:--
+
+�Send the attendant away. We must be alone with him when he becomes
+
+conscious, after the operation.� So I said:--
+
+�I think that will do now, Simmons. We have done all that we can at
+
+present. You had better go your round, and Dr. Van Helsing will operate.
+
+Let me know instantly if there be anything unusual anywhere.�
+
+The man withdrew, and we went into a strict examination of the patient.
+
+The wounds of the face was superficial; the real injury was a depressed
+
+fracture of the skull, extending right up through the motor area. The
+
+Professor thought a moment and said:--
+
+�We must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions, as far
+
+as can be; the rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature of
+
+his injury. The whole motor area seems affected. The suffusion of the
+
+brain will increase quickly, so we must trephine at once or it may be
+
+too late.� As he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door. I
+
+went over and opened it and found in the corridor without, Arthur and
+
+Quincey in pajamas and slippers: the former spoke:--
+
+�I heard your man call up Dr. Van Helsing and tell him of an accident.
+
+So I woke Quincey or rather called for him as he was not asleep. Things
+
+are moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of us
+
+these times. I�ve been thinking that to-morrow night will not see things
+
+as they have been. We�ll have to look back--and forward a little more
+
+than we have done. May we come in?� I nodded, and held the door open
+
+till they had entered; then I closed it again. When Quincey saw the
+
+attitude and state of the patient, and noted the horrible pool on the
+
+floor, he said softly:--
+
+�My God! what has happened to him? Poor, poor devil!� I told him
+
+briefly, and added that we expected he would recover consciousness after
+
+the operation--for a short time, at all events. He went at once and sat
+
+down on the edge of the bed, with Godalming beside him; we all watched
+
+in patience.
+
+�We shall wait,� said Van Helsing, �just long enough to fix the best
+
+spot for trephining, so that we may most quickly and perfectly remove
+
+the blood clot; for it is evident that the h�morrhage is increasing.�
+
+The minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness. I had a
+
+horrible sinking in my heart, and from Van Helsing�s face I gathered
+
+that he felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come. I dreaded
+
+the words that Renfield might speak. I was positively afraid to think;
+
+but the conviction of what was coming was on me, as I have read of men
+
+who have heard the death-watch. The poor man�s breathing came in
+
+uncertain gasps. Each instant he seemed as though he would open his eyes
+
+and speak; but then would follow a prolonged stertorous breath, and he
+
+would relapse into a more fixed insensibility. Inured as I was to sick
+
+beds and death, this suspense grew, and grew upon me. I could almost
+
+hear the beating of my own heart; and the blood surging through my
+
+temples sounded like blows from a hammer. The silence finally became
+
+agonising. I looked at my companions, one after another, and saw from
+
+their flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equal
+
+torture. There was a nervous suspense over us all, as though overhead
+
+some dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should least expect
+
+it.
+
+At last there came a time when it was evident that the patient was
+
+sinking fast; he might die at any moment. I looked up at the Professor
+
+and caught his eyes fixed on mine. His face was sternly set as he
+
+spoke:--
+
+�There is no time to lose. His words may be worth many lives; I have
+
+been thinking so, as I stood here. It may be there is a soul at stake!
+
+We shall operate just above the ear.�
+
+Without another word he made the operation. For a few moments the
+
+breathing continued to be stertorous. Then there came a breath so
+
+prolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chest.
+
+Suddenly his eyes opened, and became fixed in a wild, helpless stare.
+
+This was continued for a few moments; then it softened into a glad
+
+surprise, and from the lips came a sigh of relief. He moved
+
+convulsively, and as he did so, said:--
+
+�I�ll be quiet, Doctor. Tell them to take off the strait-waistcoat. I
+
+have had a terrible dream, and it has left me so weak that I cannot
+
+move. What�s wrong with my face? it feels all swollen, and it smarts
+
+dreadfully.� He tried to turn his head; but even with the effort his
+
+eyes seemed to grow glassy again so I gently put it back. Then Van
+
+Helsing said in a quiet grave tone:--
+
+�Tell us your dream, Mr. Renfield.� As he heard the voice his face
+
+brightened, through its mutilation, and he said:--
+
+�That is Dr. Van Helsing. How good it is of you to be here. Give me some
+
+water, my lips are dry; and I shall try to tell you. I dreamed�--he
+
+stopped and seemed fainting, I called quietly to Quincey--�The
+
+brandy--it is in my study--quick!� He flew and returned with a glass,
+
+the decanter of brandy and a carafe of water. We moistened the parched
+
+lips, and the patient quickly revived. It seemed, however, that his poor
+
+injured brain had been working in the interval, for, when he was quite
+
+conscious, he looked at me piercingly with an agonised confusion which I
+
+shall never forget, and said:--
+
+�I must not deceive myself; it was no dream, but all a grim reality.�
+
+Then his eyes roved round the room; as they caught sight of the two
+
+figures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed he went on:--
+
+�If I were not sure already, I would know from them.� For an instant his
+
+eyes closed--not with pain or sleep but voluntarily, as though he were
+
+bringing all his faculties to bear; when he opened them he said,
+
+hurriedly, and with more energy than he had yet displayed:--
+
+�Quick, Doctor, quick. I am dying! I feel that I have but a few minutes;
+
+and then I must go back to death--or worse! Wet my lips with brandy
+
+again. I have something that I must say before I die; or before my poor
+
+crushed brain dies anyhow. Thank you! It was that night after you left
+
+me, when I implored you to let me go away. I couldn�t speak then, for I
+
+felt my tongue was tied; but I was as sane then, except in that way, as
+
+I am now. I was in an agony of despair for a long time after you left
+
+me; it seemed hours. Then there came a sudden peace to me. My brain
+
+seemed to become cool again, and I realised where I was. I heard the
+
+dogs bark behind our house, but not where He was!� As he spoke, Van
+
+Helsing�s eyes never blinked, but his hand came out and met mine and
+
+gripped it hard. He did not, however, betray himself; he nodded slightly
+
+and said: �Go on,� in a low voice. Renfield proceeded:--
+
+�He came up to the window in the mist, as I had seen him often before;
+
+but he was solid then--not a ghost, and his eyes were fierce like a
+
+man�s when angry. He was laughing with his red mouth; the sharp white
+
+teeth glinted in the moonlight when he turned to look back over the belt
+
+of trees, to where the dogs were barking. I wouldn�t ask him to come in
+
+at first, though I knew he wanted to--just as he had wanted all along.
+
+Then he began promising me things--not in words but by doing them.� He
+
+was interrupted by a word from the Professor:--
+
+�How?�
+
+�By making them happen; just as he used to send in the flies when the
+
+sun was shining. Great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on their
+
+wings; and big moths, in the night, with skull and cross-bones on their
+
+backs.� Van Helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me unconsciously:--
+
+�The _Acherontia Aitetropos of the Sphinges_--what you call the
+
+�Death�s-head Moth�?� The patient went on without stopping.
+
+�Then he began to whisper: �Rats, rats, rats! Hundreds, thousands,
+
+millions of them, and every one a life; and dogs to eat them, and cats
+
+too. All lives! all red blood, with years of life in it; and not merely
+
+buzzing flies!� I laughed at him, for I wanted to see what he could do.
+
+Then the dogs howled, away beyond the dark trees in His house. He
+
+beckoned me to the window. I got up and looked out, and He raised his
+
+hands, and seemed to call out without using any words. A dark mass
+
+spread over the grass, coming on like the shape of a flame of fire; and
+
+then He moved the mist to the right and left, and I could see that there
+
+were thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red--like His, only
+
+smaller. He held up his hand, and they all stopped; and I thought he
+
+seemed to be saying: �All these lives will I give you, ay, and many more
+
+and greater, through countless ages, if you will fall down and worship
+
+me!� And then a red cloud, like the colour of blood, seemed to close
+
+over my eyes; and before I knew what I was doing, I found myself opening
+
+the sash and saying to Him: �Come in, Lord and Master!� The rats were
+
+all gone, but He slid into the room through the sash, though it was only
+
+open an inch wide--just as the Moon herself has often come in through
+
+the tiniest crack and has stood before me in all her size and
+
+splendour.�
+
+His voice was weaker, so I moistened his lips with the brandy again, and
+
+he continued; but it seemed as though his memory had gone on working in
+
+the interval for his story was further advanced. I was about to call him
+
+back to the point, but Van Helsing whispered to me: �Let him go on. Do
+
+not interrupt him; he cannot go back, and maybe could not proceed at all
+
+if once he lost the thread of his thought.� He proceeded:--
+
+�All day I waited to hear from him, but he did not send me anything, not
+
+even a blow-fly, and when the moon got up I was pretty angry with him.
+
+When he slid in through the window, though it was shut, and did not even
+
+knock, I got mad with him. He sneered at me, and his white face looked
+
+out of the mist with his red eyes gleaming, and he went on as though he
+
+owned the whole place, and I was no one. He didn�t even smell the same
+
+as he went by me. I couldn�t hold him. I thought that, somehow, Mrs.
+
+Harker had come into the room.�
+
+The two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over, standing behind
+
+him so that he could not see them, but where they could hear better.
+
+They were both silent, but the Professor started and quivered; his face,
+
+however, grew grimmer and sterner still. Renfield went on without
+
+noticing:--
+
+�When Mrs. Harker came in to see me this afternoon she wasn�t the same;
+
+it was like tea after the teapot had been watered.� Here we all moved,
+
+but no one said a word; he went on:--
+
+�I didn�t know that she was here till she spoke; and she didn�t look the
+
+same. I don�t care for the pale people; I like them with lots of blood
+
+in them, and hers had all seemed to have run out. I didn�t think of it
+
+at the time; but when she went away I began to think, and it made me mad
+
+to know that He had been taking the life out of her.� I could feel that
+
+the rest quivered, as I did, but we remained otherwise still. �So when
+
+He came to-night I was ready for Him. I saw the mist stealing in, and I
+
+grabbed it tight. I had heard that madmen have unnatural strength; and
+
+as I knew I was a madman--at times anyhow--I resolved to use my power.
+
+Ay, and He felt it too, for He had to come out of the mist to struggle
+
+with me. I held tight; and I thought I was going to win, for I didn�t
+
+mean Him to take any more of her life, till I saw His eyes. They burned
+
+into me, and my strength became like water. He slipped through it, and
+
+when I tried to cling to Him, He raised me up and flung me down. There
+
+was a red cloud before me, and a noise like thunder, and the mist seemed
+
+to steal away under the door.� His voice was becoming fainter and his
+
+breath more stertorous. Van Helsing stood up instinctively.
+
+�We know the worst now,� he said. �He is here, and we know his purpose.
+
+It may not be too late. Let us be armed--the same as we were the other
+
+night, but lose no time; there is not an instant to spare.� There was no
+
+need to put our fear, nay our conviction, into words--we shared them in
+
+common. We all hurried and took from our rooms the same things that we
+
+had when we entered the Count�s house. The Professor had his ready, and
+
+as we met in the corridor he pointed to them significantly as he said:--
+
+�They never leave me; and they shall not till this unhappy business is
+
+over. Be wise also, my friends. It is no common enemy that we deal with.
+
+Alas! alas! that that dear Madam Mina should suffer!� He stopped; his
+
+voice was breaking, and I do not know if rage or terror predominated in
+
+my own heart.
+
+Outside the Harkers� door we paused. Art and Quincey held back, and the
+
+latter said:--
+
+�Should we disturb her?�
+
+�We must,� said Van Helsing grimly. �If the door be locked, I shall
+
+break it in.�
+
+�May it not frighten her terribly? It is unusual to break into a lady�s
+
+room!�
+
+Van Helsing said solemnly, �You are always right; but this is life and
+
+death. All chambers are alike to the doctor; and even were they not they
+
+are all as one to me to-night. Friend John, when I turn the handle, if
+
+the door does not open, do you put your shoulder down and shove; and you
+
+too, my friends. Now!�
+
+He turned the handle as he spoke, but the door did not yield. We threw
+
+ourselves against it; with a crash it burst open, and we almost fell
+
+headlong into the room. The Professor did actually fall, and I saw
+
+across him as he gathered himself up from hands and knees. What I saw
+
+appalled me. I felt my hair rise like bristles on the back of my neck,
+
+and my heart seemed to stand still.
+
+The moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the room
+
+was light enough to see. On the bed beside the window lay Jonathan
+
+Harker, his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor.
+
+Kneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was the white-clad
+
+figure of his wife. By her side stood a tall, thin man, clad in black.
+
+His face was turned from us, but the instant we saw we all recognised
+
+the Count--in every way, even to the scar on his forehead. With his left
+
+hand he held both Mrs. Harker�s hands, keeping them away with her arms
+
+at full tension; his right hand gripped her by the back of the neck,
+
+forcing her face down on his bosom. Her white nightdress was smeared
+
+with blood, and a thin stream trickled down the man�s bare breast which
+
+was shown by his torn-open dress. The attitude of the two had a terrible
+
+resemblance to a child forcing a kitten�s nose into a saucer of milk to
+
+compel it to drink. As we burst into the room, the Count turned his
+
+face, and the hellish look that I had heard described seemed to leap
+
+into it. His eyes flamed red with devilish passion; the great nostrils
+
+of the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge; and the
+
+white sharp teeth, behind the full lips of the blood-dripping mouth,
+
+champed together like those of a wild beast. With a wrench, which threw
+
+his victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height, he turned
+
+and sprang at us. But by this time the Professor had gained his feet,
+
+and was holding towards him the envelope which contained the Sacred
+
+Wafer. The Count suddenly stopped, just as poor Lucy had done outside
+
+the tomb, and cowered back. Further and further back he cowered, as we,
+
+lifting our crucifixes, advanced. The moonlight suddenly failed, as a
+
+great black cloud sailed across the sky; and when the gaslight sprang up
+
+under Quincey�s match, we saw nothing but a faint vapour. This, as we
+
+looked, trailed under the door, which with the recoil from its bursting
+
+open, had swung back to its old position. Van Helsing, Art, and I moved
+
+forward to Mrs. Harker, who by this time had drawn her breath and with
+
+it had given a scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so despairing that it
+
+seems to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day. For a
+
+few seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray. Her face was
+
+ghastly, with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared
+
+her lips and cheeks and chin; from her throat trickled a thin stream of
+
+blood; her eyes were mad with terror. Then she put before her face her
+
+poor crushed hands, which bore on their whiteness the red mark of the
+
+Count�s terrible grip, and from behind them came a low desolate wail
+
+which made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an
+
+endless grief. Van Helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently
+
+over her body, whilst Art, after looking at her face for an instant
+
+despairingly, ran out of the room. Van Helsing whispered to me:--
+
+�Jonathan is in a stupor such as we know the Vampire can produce. We can
+
+do nothing with poor Madam Mina for a few moments till she recovers
+
+herself; I must wake him!� He dipped the end of a towel in cold water
+
+and with it began to flick him on the face, his wife all the while
+
+holding her face between her hands and sobbing in a way that was
+
+heart-breaking to hear. I raised the blind, and looked out of the
+
+window. There was much moonshine; and as I looked I could see Quincey
+
+Morris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of a great
+
+yew-tree. It puzzled me to think why he was doing this; but at the
+
+instant I heard Harker�s quick exclamation as he woke to partial
+
+consciousness, and turned to the bed. On his face, as there might well
+
+be, was a look of wild amazement. He seemed dazed for a few seconds, and
+
+then full consciousness seemed to burst upon him all at once, and he
+
+started up. His wife was aroused by the quick movement, and turned to
+
+him with her arms stretched out, as though to embrace him; instantly,
+
+however, she drew them in again, and putting her elbows together, held
+
+her hands before her face, and shuddered till the bed beneath her shook.
+
+�In God�s name what does this mean?� Harker cried out. �Dr. Seward, Dr.
+
+Van Helsing, what is it? What has happened? What is wrong? Mina, dear,
+
+what is it? What does that blood mean? My God, my God! has it come to
+
+this!� and, raising himself to his knees, he beat his hands wildly
+
+together. �Good God help us! help her! oh, help her!� With a quick
+
+movement he jumped from bed, and began to pull on his clothes,--all the
+
+man in him awake at the need for instant exertion. �What has happened?
+
+Tell me all about it!� he cried without pausing. �Dr. Van Helsing, you
+
+love Mina, I know. Oh, do something to save her. It cannot have gone too
+
+far yet. Guard her while I look for _him_!� His wife, through her terror
+
+and horror and distress, saw some sure danger to him: instantly
+
+forgetting her own grief, she seized hold of him and cried out:--
+
+�No! no! Jonathan, you must not leave me. I have suffered enough
+
+to-night, God knows, without the dread of his harming you. You must stay
+
+with me. Stay with these friends who will watch over you!� Her
+
+expression became frantic as she spoke; and, he yielding to her, she
+
+pulled him down sitting on the bed side, and clung to him fiercely.
+
+Van Helsing and I tried to calm them both. The Professor held up his
+
+little golden crucifix, and said with wonderful calmness:--
+
+�Do not fear, my dear. We are here; and whilst this is close to you no
+
+foul thing can approach. You are safe for to-night; and we must be calm
+
+and take counsel together.� She shuddered and was silent, holding down
+
+her head on her husband�s breast. When she raised it, his white
+
+night-robe was stained with blood where her lips had touched, and where
+
+the thin open wound in her neck had sent forth drops. The instant she
+
+saw it she drew back, with a low wail, and whispered, amidst choking
+
+sobs:--
+
+�Unclean, unclean! I must touch him or kiss him no more. Oh, that it
+
+should be that it is I who am now his worst enemy, and whom he may have
+
+most cause to fear.� To this he spoke out resolutely:--
+
+�Nonsense, Mina. It is a shame to me to hear such a word. I would not
+
+hear it of you; and I shall not hear it from you. May God judge me by my
+
+deserts, and punish me with more bitter suffering than even this hour,
+
+if by any act or will of mine anything ever come between us!� He put out
+
+his arms and folded her to his breast; and for a while she lay there
+
+sobbing. He looked at us over her bowed head, with eyes that blinked
+
+damply above his quivering nostrils; his mouth was set as steel. After a
+
+while her sobs became less frequent and more faint, and then he said to
+
+me, speaking with a studied calmness which I felt tried his nervous
+
+power to the utmost:--
+
+�And now, Dr. Seward, tell me all about it. Too well I know the broad
+
+fact; tell me all that has been.� I told him exactly what had happened,
+
+and he listened with seeming impassiveness; but his nostrils twitched
+
+and his eyes blazed as I told how the ruthless hands of the Count had
+
+held his wife in that terrible and horrid position, with her mouth to
+
+the open wound in his breast. It interested me, even at that moment, to
+
+see, that, whilst the face of white set passion worked convulsively over
+
+the bowed head, the hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled
+
+hair. Just as I had finished, Quincey and Godalming knocked at the door.
+
+They entered in obedience to our summons. Van Helsing looked at me
+
+questioningly. I understood him to mean if we were to take advantage of
+
+their coming to divert if possible the thoughts of the unhappy husband
+
+and wife from each other and from themselves; so on nodding acquiescence
+
+to him he asked them what they had seen or done. To which Lord Godalming
+
+answered:--
+
+�I could not see him anywhere in the passage, or in any of our rooms. I
+
+looked in the study but, though he had been there, he had gone. He had,
+
+however----� He stopped suddenly, looking at the poor drooping figure on
+
+the bed. Van Helsing said gravely:--
+
+�Go on, friend Arthur. We want here no more concealments. Our hope now
+
+is in knowing all. Tell freely!� So Art went on:--
+
+�He had been there, and though it could only have been for a few
+
+seconds, he made rare hay of the place. All the manuscript had been
+
+burned, and the blue flames were flickering amongst the white ashes; the
+
+cylinders of your phonograph too were thrown on the fire, and the wax
+
+had helped the flames.� Here I interrupted. �Thank God there is the
+
+other copy in the safe!� His face lit for a moment, but fell again as he
+
+went on: �I ran downstairs then, but could see no sign of him. I looked
+
+into Renfield�s room; but there was no trace there except----!� Again he
+
+paused. �Go on,� said Harker hoarsely; so he bowed his head and
+
+moistening his lips with his tongue, added: �except that the poor fellow
+
+is dead.� Mrs. Harker raised her head, looking from one to the other of
+
+us she said solemnly:--
+
+�God�s will be done!� I could not but feel that Art was keeping back
+
+something; but, as I took it that it was with a purpose, I said nothing.
+
+Van Helsing turned to Morris and asked:--
+
+�And you, friend Quincey, have you any to tell?�
+
+�A little,� he answered. �It may be much eventually, but at present I
+
+can�t say. I thought it well to know if possible where the Count would
+
+go when he left the house. I did not see him; but I saw a bat rise from
+
+Renfield�s window, and flap westward. I expected to see him in some
+
+shape go back to Carfax; but he evidently sought some other lair. He
+
+will not be back to-night; for the sky is reddening in the east, and the
+
+dawn is close. We must work to-morrow!�
+
+He said the latter words through his shut teeth. For a space of perhaps
+
+a couple of minutes there was silence, and I could fancy that I could
+
+hear the sound of our hearts beating; then Van Helsing said, placing his
+
+hand very tenderly on Mrs. Harker�s head:--
+
+�And now, Madam Mina--poor, dear, dear Madam Mina--tell us exactly what
+
+happened. God knows that I do not want that you be pained; but it is
+
+need that we know all. For now more than ever has all work to be done
+
+quick and sharp, and in deadly earnest. The day is close to us that must
+
+end all, if it may be so; and now is the chance that we may live and
+
+learn.�
+
+The poor, dear lady shivered, and I could see the tension of her nerves
+
+as she clasped her husband closer to her and bent her head lower and
+
+lower still on his breast. Then she raised her head proudly, and held
+
+out one hand to Van Helsing who took it in his, and, after stooping and
+
+kissing it reverently, held it fast. The other hand was locked in that
+
+of her husband, who held his other arm thrown round her protectingly.
+
+After a pause in which she was evidently ordering her thoughts, she
+
+began:--
+
+�I took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me, but for a
+
+long time it did not act. I seemed to become more wakeful, and myriads
+
+of horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind--all of them
+
+connected with death, and vampires; with blood, and pain, and trouble.�
+
+Her husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and said
+
+lovingly: �Do not fret, dear. You must be brave and strong, and help me
+
+through the horrible task. If you only knew what an effort it is to me
+
+to tell of this fearful thing at all, you would understand how much I
+
+need your help. Well, I saw I must try to help the medicine to its work
+
+with my will, if it was to do me any good, so I resolutely set myself to
+
+sleep. Sure enough sleep must soon have come to me, for I remember no
+
+more. Jonathan coming in had not waked me, for he lay by my side when
+
+next I remember. There was in the room the same thin white mist that I
+
+had before noticed. But I forget now if you know of this; you will find
+
+it in my diary which I shall show you later. I felt the same vague
+
+terror which had come to me before and the same sense of some presence.
+
+I turned to wake Jonathan, but found that he slept so soundly that it
+
+seemed as if it was he who had taken the sleeping draught, and not I. I
+
+tried, but I could not wake him. This caused me a great fear, and I
+
+looked around terrified. Then indeed, my heart sank within me: beside
+
+the bed, as if he had stepped out of the mist--or rather as if the mist
+
+had turned into his figure, for it had entirely disappeared--stood a
+
+tall, thin man, all in black. I knew him at once from the description of
+
+the others. The waxen face; the high aquiline nose, on which the light
+
+fell in a thin white line; the parted red lips, with the sharp white
+
+teeth showing between; and the red eyes that I had seemed to see in the
+
+sunset on the windows of St. Mary�s Church at Whitby. I knew, too, the
+
+red scar on his forehead where Jonathan had struck him. For an instant
+
+my heart stood still, and I would have screamed out, only that I was
+
+paralysed. In the pause he spoke in a sort of keen, cutting whisper,
+
+pointing as he spoke to Jonathan:--
+
+��Silence! If you make a sound I shall take him and dash his brains out
+
+before your very eyes.� I was appalled and was too bewildered to do or
+
+say anything. With a mocking smile, he placed one hand upon my shoulder
+
+and, holding me tight, bared my throat with the other, saying as he did
+
+so, �First, a little refreshment to reward my exertions. You may as well
+
+be quiet; it is not the first time, or the second, that your veins have
+
+appeased my thirst!� I was bewildered, and, strangely enough, I did not
+
+want to hinder him. I suppose it is a part of the horrible curse that
+
+such is, when his touch is on his victim. And oh, my God, my God, pity
+
+me! He placed his reeking lips upon my throat!� Her husband groaned
+
+again. She clasped his hand harder, and looked at him pityingly, as if
+
+he were the injured one, and went on:--
+
+�I felt my strength fading away, and I was in a half swoon. How long
+
+this horrible thing lasted I know not; but it seemed that a long time
+
+must have passed before he took his foul, awful, sneering mouth away. I
+
+saw it drip with the fresh blood!� The remembrance seemed for a while to
+
+overpower her, and she drooped and would have sunk down but for her
+
+husband�s sustaining arm. With a great effort she recovered herself and
+
+went on:--
+
+�Then he spoke to me mockingly, �And so you, like the others, would play
+
+your brains against mine. You would help these men to hunt me and
+
+frustrate me in my designs! You know now, and they know in part already,
+
+and will know in full before long, what it is to cross my path. They
+
+should have kept their energies for use closer to home. Whilst they
+
+played wits against me--against me who commanded nations, and intrigued
+
+for them, and fought for them, hundreds of years before they were
+
+born--I was countermining them. And you, their best beloved one, are now
+
+to me, flesh of my flesh; blood of my blood; kin of my kin; my bountiful
+
+wine-press for a while; and shall be later on my companion and my
+
+helper. You shall be avenged in turn; for not one of them but shall
+
+minister to your needs. But as yet you are to be punished for what you
+
+have done. You have aided in thwarting me; now you shall come to my
+
+call. When my brain says �Come!� to you, you shall cross land or sea to
+
+do my bidding; and to that end this!� With that he pulled open his
+
+shirt, and with his long sharp nails opened a vein in his breast. When
+
+the blood began to spurt out, he took my hands in one of his, holding
+
+them tight, and with the other seized my neck and pressed my mouth to
+
+the wound, so that I must either suffocate or swallow some of the---- Oh
+
+my God! my God! what have I done? What have I done to deserve such a
+
+fate, I who have tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all my
+
+days. God pity me! Look down on a poor soul in worse than mortal peril;
+
+and in mercy pity those to whom she is dear!� Then she began to rub her
+
+lips as though to cleanse them from pollution.
+
+As she was telling her terrible story, the eastern sky began to quicken,
+
+and everything became more and more clear. Harker was still and quiet;
+
+but over his face, as the awful narrative went on, came a grey look
+
+which deepened and deepened in the morning light, till when the first
+
+red streak of the coming dawn shot up, the flesh stood darkly out
+
+against the whitening hair.
+
+We have arranged that one of us is to stay within call of the unhappy
+
+pair till we can meet together and arrange about taking action.
+
+Of this I am sure: the sun rises to-day on no more miserable house in
+
+all the great round of its daily course.

+CHAPTER XXV
+
+DR. SEWARD�S DIARY
+
+_11 October, Evening._--Jonathan Harker has asked me to note this, as he
+
+says he is hardly equal to the task, and he wants an exact record kept.
+
+I think that none of us were surprised when we were asked to see Mrs.
+
+Harker a little before the time of sunset. We have of late come to
+
+understand that sunrise and sunset are to her times of peculiar freedom;
+
+when her old self can be manifest without any controlling force subduing
+
+or restraining her, or inciting her to action. This mood or condition
+
+begins some half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset, and lasts
+
+till either the sun is high, or whilst the clouds are still aglow with
+
+the rays streaming above the horizon. At first there is a sort of
+
+negative condition, as if some tie were loosened, and then the absolute
+
+freedom quickly follows; when, however, the freedom ceases the
+
+change-back or relapse comes quickly, preceded only by a spell of
+
+warning silence.
+
+To-night, when we met, she was somewhat constrained, and bore all the
+
+signs of an internal struggle. I put it down myself to her making a
+
+violent effort at the earliest instant she could do so. A very few
+
+minutes, however, gave her complete control of herself; then, motioning
+
+her husband to sit beside her on the sofa where she was half reclining,
+
+she made the rest of us bring chairs up close. Taking her husband�s hand
+
+in hers began:--
+
+�We are all here together in freedom, for perhaps the last time! I know,
+
+dear; I know that you will always be with me to the end.� This was to
+
+her husband whose hand had, as we could see, tightened upon hers. �In
+
+the morning we go out upon our task, and God alone knows what may be in
+
+store for any of us. You are going to be so good to me as to take me
+
+with you. I know that all that brave earnest men can do for a poor weak
+
+woman, whose soul perhaps is lost--no, no, not yet, but is at any rate
+
+at stake--you will do. But you must remember that I am not as you are.
+
+There is a poison in my blood, in my soul, which may destroy me; which
+
+must destroy me, unless some relief comes to us. Oh, my friends, you
+
+know as well as I do, that my soul is at stake; and though I know there
+
+is one way out for me, you must not and I must not take it!� She looked
+
+appealingly to us all in turn, beginning and ending with her husband.
+
+�What is that way?� asked Van Helsing in a hoarse voice. �What is that
+
+way, which we must not--may not--take?�
+
+�That I may die now, either by my own hand or that of another, before
+
+the greater evil is entirely wrought. I know, and you know, that were I
+
+once dead you could and would set free my immortal spirit, even as you
+
+did my poor Lucy�s. Were death, or the fear of death, the only thing
+
+that stood in the way I would not shrink to die here, now, amidst the
+
+friends who love me. But death is not all. I cannot believe that to die
+
+in such a case, when there is hope before us and a bitter task to be
+
+done, is God�s will. Therefore, I, on my part, give up here the
+
+certainty of eternal rest, and go out into the dark where may be the
+
+blackest things that the world or the nether world holds!� We were all
+
+silent, for we knew instinctively that this was only a prelude. The
+
+faces of the others were set and Harker�s grew ashen grey; perhaps he
+
+guessed better than any of us what was coming. She continued:--
+
+�This is what I can give into the hotch-pot.� I could not but note the
+
+quaint legal phrase which she used in such a place, and with all
+
+seriousness. �What will each of you give? Your lives I know,� she went
+
+on quickly, �that is easy for brave men. Your lives are God�s, and you
+
+can give them back to Him; but what will you give to me?� She looked
+
+again questioningly, but this time avoided her husband�s face. Quincey
+
+seemed to understand; he nodded, and her face lit up. �Then I shall tell
+
+you plainly what I want, for there must be no doubtful matter in this
+
+connection between us now. You must promise me, one and all--even you,
+
+my beloved husband--that, should the time come, you will kill me.�
+
+�What is that time?� The voice was Quincey�s, but it was low and
+
+strained.
+
+�When you shall be convinced that I am so changed that it is better that
+
+I die than I may live. When I am thus dead in the flesh, then you will,
+
+without a moment�s delay, drive a stake through me and cut off my head;
+
+or do whatever else may be wanting to give me rest!�
+
+Quincey was the first to rise after the pause. He knelt down before her
+
+and taking her hand in his said solemnly:--
+
+�I�m only a rough fellow, who hasn�t, perhaps, lived as a man should to
+
+win such a distinction, but I swear to you by all that I hold sacred and
+
+dear that, should the time ever come, I shall not flinch from the duty
+
+that you have set us. And I promise you, too, that I shall make all
+
+certain, for if I am only doubtful I shall take it that the time has
+
+come!�
+
+�My true friend!� was all she could say amid her fast-falling tears, as,
+
+bending over, she kissed his hand.
+
+�I swear the same, my dear Madam Mina!� said Van Helsing.
+
+�And I!� said Lord Godalming, each of them in turn kneeling to her to
+
+take the oath. I followed, myself. Then her husband turned to her
+
+wan-eyed and with a greenish pallor which subdued the snowy whiteness of
+
+his hair, and asked:--
+
+�And must I, too, make such a promise, oh, my wife?�
+
+�You too, my dearest,� she said, with infinite yearning of pity in her
+
+voice and eyes. �You must not shrink. You are nearest and dearest and
+
+all the world to me; our souls are knit into one, for all life and all
+
+time. Think, dear, that there have been times when brave men have killed
+
+their wives and their womenkind, to keep them from falling into the
+
+hands of the enemy. Their hands did not falter any the more because
+
+those that they loved implored them to slay them. It is men�s duty
+
+towards those whom they love, in such times of sore trial! And oh, my
+
+dear, if it is to be that I must meet death at any hand, let it be at
+
+the hand of him that loves me best. Dr. Van Helsing, I have not
+
+forgotten your mercy in poor Lucy�s case to him who loved�--she stopped
+
+with a flying blush, and changed her phrase--�to him who had best right
+
+to give her peace. If that time shall come again, I look to you to make
+
+it a happy memory of my husband�s life that it was his loving hand which
+
+set me free from the awful thrall upon me.�
+
+�Again I swear!� came the Professor�s resonant voice. Mrs. Harker
+
+smiled, positively smiled, as with a sigh of relief she leaned back and
+
+said:--
+
+�And now one word of warning, a warning which you must never forget:
+
+this time, if it ever come, may come quickly and unexpectedly, and in
+
+such case you must lose no time in using your opportunity. At such a
+
+time I myself might be--nay! if the time ever comes, _shall be_--leagued
+
+with your enemy against you.�
+
+�One more request;� she became very solemn as she said this, �it is not
+
+vital and necessary like the other, but I want you to do one thing for
+
+me, if you will.� We all acquiesced, but no one spoke; there was no need
+
+to speak:--
+
+�I want you to read the Burial Service.� She was interrupted by a deep
+
+groan from her husband; taking his hand in hers, she held it over her
+
+heart, and continued: �You must read it over me some day. Whatever may
+
+be the issue of all this fearful state of things, it will be a sweet
+
+thought to all or some of us. You, my dearest, will I hope read it, for
+
+then it will be in your voice in my memory for ever--come what may!�
+
+�But oh, my dear one,� he pleaded, �death is afar off from you.�
+
+�Nay,� she said, holding up a warning hand. �I am deeper in death at
+
+this moment than if the weight of an earthly grave lay heavy upon me!�
+
+�Oh, my wife, must I read it?� he said, before he began.
+
+�It would comfort me, my husband!� was all she said; and he began to
+
+read when she had got the book ready.
+
+�How can I--how could any one--tell of that strange scene, its
+
+solemnity, its gloom, its sadness, its horror; and, withal, its
+
+sweetness. Even a sceptic, who can see nothing but a travesty of bitter
+
+truth in anything holy or emotional, would have been melted to the heart
+
+had he seen that little group of loving and devoted friends kneeling
+
+round that stricken and sorrowing lady; or heard the tender passion of
+
+her husband�s voice, as in tones so broken with emotion that often he
+
+had to pause, he read the simple and beautiful service from the Burial
+
+of the Dead. I--I cannot go on--words--and--v-voice--f-fail m-me!�
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+She was right in her instinct. Strange as it all was, bizarre as it may
+
+hereafter seem even to us who felt its potent influence at the time, it
+
+comforted us much; and the silence, which showed Mrs. Harker�s coming
+
+relapse from her freedom of soul, did not seem so full of despair to any
+
+of us as we had dreaded.
+
+_Jonathan Harker�s Journal._
+
+_15 October, Varna._--We left Charing Cross on the morning of the 12th,
+
+got to Paris the same night, and took the places secured for us in the
+
+Orient Express. We travelled night and day, arriving here at about five
+
+o�clock. Lord Godalming went to the Consulate to see if any telegram had
+
+arrived for him, whilst the rest of us came on to this hotel--�the
+
+Odessus.� The journey may have had incidents; I was, however, too eager
+
+to get on, to care for them. Until the _Czarina Catherine_ comes into
+
+port there will be no interest for me in anything in the wide world.
+
+Thank God! Mina is well, and looks to be getting stronger; her colour is
+
+coming back. She sleeps a great deal; throughout the journey she slept
+
+nearly all the time. Before sunrise and sunset, however, she is very
+
+wakeful and alert; and it has become a habit for Van Helsing to
+
+hypnotise her at such times. At first, some effort was needed, and he
+
+had to make many passes; but now, she seems to yield at once, as if by
+
+habit, and scarcely any action is needed. He seems to have power at
+
+these particular moments to simply will, and her thoughts obey him. He
+
+always asks her what she can see and hear. She answers to the first:--
+
+�Nothing; all is dark.� And to the second:--
+
+�I can hear the waves lapping against the ship, and the water rushing
+
+by. Canvas and cordage strain and masts and yards creak. The wind is
+
+high--I can hear it in the shrouds, and the bow throws back the foam.�
+
+It is evident that the _Czarina Catherine_ is still at sea, hastening on
+
+her way to Varna. Lord Godalming has just returned. He had four
+
+telegrams, one each day since we started, and all to the same effect:
+
+that the _Czarina Catherine_ had not been reported to Lloyd�s from
+
+anywhere. He had arranged before leaving London that his agent should
+
+send him every day a telegram saying if the ship had been reported. He
+
+was to have a message even if she were not reported, so that he might be
+
+sure that there was a watch being kept at the other end of the wire.
+
+We had dinner and went to bed early. To-morrow we are to see the
+
+Vice-Consul, and to arrange, if we can, about getting on board the ship
+
+as soon as she arrives. Van Helsing says that our chance will be to get
+
+on the boat between sunrise and sunset. The Count, even if he takes the
+
+form of a bat, cannot cross the running water of his own volition, and
+
+so cannot leave the ship. As he dare not change to man�s form without
+
+suspicion--which he evidently wishes to avoid--he must remain in the
+
+box. If, then, we can come on board after sunrise, he is at our mercy;
+
+for we can open the box and make sure of him, as we did of poor Lucy,
+
+before he wakes. What mercy he shall get from us will not count for
+
+much. We think that we shall not have much trouble with officials or the
+
+seamen. Thank God! this is the country where bribery can do anything,
+
+and we are well supplied with money. We have only to make sure that the
+
+ship cannot come into port between sunset and sunrise without our being
+
+warned, and we shall be safe. Judge Moneybag will settle this case, I
+
+think!
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_16 October._--Mina�s report still the same: lapping waves and rushing
+
+water, darkness and favouring winds. We are evidently in good time, and
+
+when we hear of the _Czarina Catherine_ we shall be ready. As she must
+
+pass the Dardanelles we are sure to have some report.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_17 October._--Everything is pretty well fixed now, I think, to welcome
+
+the Count on his return from his tour. Godalming told the shippers that
+
+he fancied that the box sent aboard might contain something stolen from
+
+a friend of his, and got a half consent that he might open it at his own
+
+risk. The owner gave him a paper telling the Captain to give him every
+
+facility in doing whatever he chose on board the ship, and also a
+
+similar authorisation to his agent at Varna. We have seen the agent, who
+
+was much impressed with Godalming�s kindly manner to him, and we are all
+
+satisfied that whatever he can do to aid our wishes will be done. We
+
+have already arranged what to do in case we get the box open. If the
+
+Count is there, Van Helsing and Seward will cut off his head at once and
+
+drive a stake through his heart. Morris and Godalming and I shall
+
+prevent interference, even if we have to use the arms which we shall
+
+have ready. The Professor says that if we can so treat the Count�s body,
+
+it will soon after fall into dust. In such case there would be no
+
+evidence against us, in case any suspicion of murder were aroused. But
+
+even if it were not, we should stand or fall by our act, and perhaps
+
+some day this very script may be evidence to come between some of us and
+
+a rope. For myself, I should take the chance only too thankfully if it
+
+were to come. We mean to leave no stone unturned to carry out our
+
+intent. We have arranged with certain officials that the instant the
+
+_Czarina Catherine_ is seen, we are to be informed by a special
+
+messenger.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_24 October._--A whole week of waiting. Daily telegrams to Godalming,
+
+but only the same story: �Not yet reported.� Mina�s morning and evening
+
+hypnotic answer is unvaried: lapping waves, rushing water, and creaking
+
+masts.
+
+_Telegram, October 24th._
+
+_Rufus Smith, Lloyd�s, London, to Lord Godalming, care of H. B. M.
+
+Vice-Consul, Varna._
+
+�_Czarina Catherine_ reported this morning from Dardanelles.�
+
+_Dr. Seward�s Diary._
+
+_25 October._--How I miss my phonograph! To write diary with a pen is
+
+irksome to me; but Van Helsing says I must. We were all wild with
+
+excitement yesterday when Godalming got his telegram from Lloyd�s. I
+
+know now what men feel in battle when the call to action is heard. Mrs.
+
+Harker, alone of our party, did not show any signs of emotion. After
+
+all, it is not strange that she did not; for we took special care not to
+
+let her know anything about it, and we all tried not to show any
+
+excitement when we were in her presence. In old days she would, I am
+
+sure, have noticed, no matter how we might have tried to conceal it; but
+
+in this way she is greatly changed during the past three weeks. The
+
+lethargy grows upon her, and though she seems strong and well, and is
+
+getting back some of her colour, Van Helsing and I are not satisfied. We
+
+talk of her often; we have not, however, said a word to the others. It
+
+would break poor Harker�s heart--certainly his nerve--if he knew that we
+
+had even a suspicion on the subject. Van Helsing examines, he tells me,
+
+her teeth very carefully, whilst she is in the hypnotic condition, for
+
+he says that so long as they do not begin to sharpen there is no active
+
+danger of a change in her. If this change should come, it would be
+
+necessary to take steps!... We both know what those steps would have to
+
+be, though we do not mention our thoughts to each other. We should
+
+neither of us shrink from the task--awful though it be to contemplate.
+
+�Euthanasia� is an excellent and a comforting word! I am grateful to
+
+whoever invented it.
+
+It is only about 24 hours� sail from the Dardanelles to here, at the
+
+rate the _Czarina Catherine_ has come from London. She should therefore
+
+arrive some time in the morning; but as she cannot possibly get in
+
+before then, we are all about to retire early. We shall get up at one
+
+o�clock, so as to be ready.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_25 October, Noon_.--No news yet of the ship�s arrival. Mrs. Harker�s
+
+hypnotic report this morning was the same as usual, so it is possible
+
+that we may get news at any moment. We men are all in a fever of
+
+excitement, except Harker, who is calm; his hands are cold as ice, and
+
+an hour ago I found him whetting the edge of the great Ghoorka knife
+
+which he now always carries with him. It will be a bad lookout for the
+
+Count if the edge of that �Kukri� ever touches his throat, driven by
+
+that stern, ice-cold hand!
+
+Van Helsing and I were a little alarmed about Mrs. Harker to-day. About
+
+noon she got into a sort of lethargy which we did not like; although we
+
+kept silence to the others, we were neither of us happy about it. She
+
+had been restless all the morning, so that we were at first glad to know
+
+that she was sleeping. When, however, her husband mentioned casually
+
+that she was sleeping so soundly that he could not wake her, we went to
+
+her room to see for ourselves. She was breathing naturally and looked so
+
+well and peaceful that we agreed that the sleep was better for her than
+
+anything else. Poor girl, she has so much to forget that it is no wonder
+
+that sleep, if it brings oblivion to her, does her good.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_Later._--Our opinion was justified, for when after a refreshing sleep
+
+of some hours she woke up, she seemed brighter and better than she had
+
+been for days. At sunset she made the usual hypnotic report. Wherever he
+
+may be in the Black Sea, the Count is hurrying to his destination. To
+
+his doom, I trust!
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_26 October._--Another day and no tidings of the _Czarina Catherine_.
+
+She ought to be here by now. That she is still journeying _somewhere_ is
+
+apparent, for Mrs. Harker�s hypnotic report at sunrise was still the
+
+same. It is possible that the vessel may be lying by, at times, for fog;
+
+some of the steamers which came in last evening reported patches of fog
+
+both to north and south of the port. We must continue our watching, as
+
+the ship may now be signalled any moment.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_27 October, Noon._--Most strange; no news yet of the ship we wait for.
+
+Mrs. Harker reported last night and this morning as usual: �lapping
+
+waves and rushing water,� though she added that �the waves were very
+
+faint.� The telegrams from London have been the same: �no further
+
+report.� Van Helsing is terribly anxious, and told me just now that he
+
+fears the Count is escaping us. He added significantly:--
+
+�I did not like that lethargy of Madam Mina�s. Souls and memories can do
+
+strange things during trance.� I was about to ask him more, but Harker
+
+just then came in, and he held up a warning hand. We must try to-night
+
+at sunset to make her speak more fully when in her hypnotic state.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_28 October._--Telegram. _Rufus Smith, London, to Lord Godalming,
+
+care H. B. M. Vice Consul, Varna._
+
+�_Czarina Catherine_ reported entering Galatz at one o�clock
+
+to-day.�
+
+_Dr. Seward�s Diary._
+
+_28 October._--When the telegram came announcing the arrival in Galatz I
+
+do not think it was such a shock to any of us as might have been
+
+expected. True, we did not know whence, or how, or when, the bolt would
+
+come; but I think we all expected that something strange would happen.
+
+The delay of arrival at Varna made us individually satisfied that things
+
+would not be just as we had expected; we only waited to learn where the
+
+change would occur. None the less, however, was it a surprise. I suppose
+
+that nature works on such a hopeful basis that we believe against
+
+ourselves that things will be as they ought to be, not as we should know
+
+that they will be. Transcendentalism is a beacon to the angels, even if
+
+it be a will-o�-the-wisp to man. It was an odd experience and we all
+
+took it differently. Van Helsing raised his hand over his head for a
+
+moment, as though in remonstrance with the Almighty; but he said not a
+
+word, and in a few seconds stood up with his face sternly set. Lord
+
+Godalming grew very pale, and sat breathing heavily. I was myself half
+
+stunned and looked in wonder at one after another. Quincey Morris
+
+tightened his belt with that quick movement which I knew so well; in our
+
+old wandering days it meant �action.� Mrs. Harker grew ghastly white, so
+
+that the scar on her forehead seemed to burn, but she folded her hands
+
+meekly and looked up in prayer. Harker smiled--actually smiled--the
+
+dark, bitter smile of one who is without hope; but at the same time his
+
+action belied his words, for his hands instinctively sought the hilt of
+
+the great Kukri knife and rested there. �When does the next train start
+
+for Galatz?� said Van Helsing to us generally.
+
+�At 6:30 to-morrow morning!� We all started, for the answer came from
+
+Mrs. Harker.
+
+�How on earth do you know?� said Art.
+
+�You forget--or perhaps you do not know, though Jonathan does and so
+
+does Dr. Van Helsing--that I am the train fiend. At home in Exeter I
+
+always used to make up the time-tables, so as to be helpful to my
+
+husband. I found it so useful sometimes, that I always make a study of
+
+the time-tables now. I knew that if anything were to take us to Castle
+
+Dracula we should go by Galatz, or at any rate through Bucharest, so I
+
+learned the times very carefully. Unhappily there are not many to learn,
+
+as the only train to-morrow leaves as I say.�
+
+�Wonderful woman!� murmured the Professor.
+
+�Can�t we get a special?� asked Lord Godalming. Van Helsing shook his
+
+head: �I fear not. This land is very different from yours or mine; even
+
+if we did have a special, it would probably not arrive as soon as our
+
+regular train. Moreover, we have something to prepare. We must think.
+
+Now let us organize. You, friend Arthur, go to the train and get the
+
+tickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go in the morning. Do
+
+you, friend Jonathan, go to the agent of the ship and get from him
+
+letters to the agent in Galatz, with authority to make search the ship
+
+just as it was here. Morris Quincey, you see the Vice-Consul, and get
+
+his aid with his fellow in Galatz and all he can do to make our way
+
+smooth, so that no times be lost when over the Danube. John will stay
+
+with Madam Mina and me, and we shall consult. For so if time be long you
+
+may be delayed; and it will not matter when the sun set, since I am here
+
+with Madam to make report.�
+
+�And I,� said Mrs. Harker brightly, and more like her old self than she
+
+had been for many a long day, �shall try to be of use in all ways, and
+
+shall think and write for you as I used to do. Something is shifting
+
+from me in some strange way, and I feel freer than I have been of late!�
+
+The three younger men looked happier at the moment as they seemed to
+
+realise the significance of her words; but Van Helsing and I, turning to
+
+each other, met each a grave and troubled glance. We said nothing at the
+
+time, however.
+
+When the three men had gone out to their tasks Van Helsing asked Mrs.
+
+Harker to look up the copy of the diaries and find him the part of
+
+Harker�s journal at the Castle. She went away to get it; when the door
+
+was shut upon her he said to me:--
+
+�We mean the same! speak out!�
+
+�There is some change. It is a hope that makes me sick, for it may
+
+deceive us.�
+
+�Quite so. Do you know why I asked her to get the manuscript?�
+
+�No!� said I, �unless it was to get an opportunity of seeing me alone.�
+
+�You are in part right, friend John, but only in part. I want to tell
+
+you something. And oh, my friend, I am taking a great--a terrible--risk;
+
+but I believe it is right. In the moment when Madam Mina said those
+
+words that arrest both our understanding, an inspiration came to me. In
+
+the trance of three days ago the Count sent her his spirit to read her
+
+mind; or more like he took her to see him in his earth-box in the ship
+
+with water rushing, just as it go free at rise and set of sun. He learn
+
+then that we are here; for she have more to tell in her open life with
+
+eyes to see and ears to hear than he, shut, as he is, in his coffin-box.
+
+Now he make his most effort to escape us. At present he want her not.
+
+�He is sure with his so great knowledge that she will come at his call;
+
+but he cut her off--take her, as he can do, out of his own power, that
+
+so she come not to him. Ah! there I have hope that our man-brains that
+
+have been of man so long and that have not lost the grace of God, will
+
+come higher than his child-brain that lie in his tomb for centuries,
+
+that grow not yet to our stature, and that do only work selfish and
+
+therefore small. Here comes Madam Mina; not a word to her of her trance!
+
+She know it not; and it would overwhelm her and make despair just when
+
+we want all her hope, all her courage; when most we want all her great
+
+brain which is trained like man�s brain, but is of sweet woman and have
+
+a special power which the Count give her, and which he may not take away
+
+altogether--though he think not so. Hush! let me speak, and you shall
+
+learn. Oh, John, my friend, we are in awful straits. I fear, as I never
+
+feared before. We can only trust the good God. Silence! here she comes!�
+
+I thought that the Professor was going to break down and have hysterics,
+
+just as he had when Lucy died, but with a great effort he controlled
+
+himself and was at perfect nervous poise when Mrs. Harker tripped into
+
+the room, bright and happy-looking and, in the doing of work, seemingly
+
+forgetful of her misery. As she came in, she handed a number of sheets
+
+of typewriting to Van Helsing. He looked over them gravely, his face
+
+brightening up as he read. Then holding the pages between his finger and
+
+thumb he said:--
+
+�Friend John, to you with so much of experience already--and you, too,
+
+dear Madam Mina, that are young--here is a lesson: do not fear ever to
+
+think. A half-thought has been buzzing often in my brain, but I fear to
+
+let him loose his wings. Here now, with more knowledge, I go back to
+
+where that half-thought come from and I find that he be no half-thought
+
+at all; that be a whole thought, though so young that he is not yet
+
+strong to use his little wings. Nay, like the �Ugly Duck� of my friend
+
+Hans Andersen, he be no duck-thought at all, but a big swan-thought that
+
+sail nobly on big wings, when the time come for him to try them. See I
+
+read here what Jonathan have written:--
+
+�That other of his race who, in a later age, again and again, brought
+
+his forces over The Great River into Turkey Land; who, when he was
+
+beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had to come
+
+alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered,
+
+since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph.�
+
+�What does this tell us? Not much? no! The Count�s child-thought see
+
+nothing; therefore he speak so free. Your man-thought see nothing; my
+
+man-thought see nothing, till just now. No! But there comes another word
+
+from some one who speak without thought because she, too, know not what
+
+it mean--what it _might_ mean. Just as there are elements which rest,
+
+yet when in nature�s course they move on their way and they touch--then
+
+pouf! and there comes a flash of light, heaven wide, that blind and kill
+
+and destroy some; but that show up all earth below for leagues and
+
+leagues. Is it not so? Well, I shall explain. To begin, have you ever
+
+study the philosophy of crime? �Yes� and �No.� You, John, yes; for it is
+
+a study of insanity. You, no, Madam Mina; for crime touch you not--not
+
+but once. Still, your mind works true, and argues not _a particulari ad
+
+universale_. There is this peculiarity in criminals. It is so constant,
+
+in all countries and at all times, that even police, who know not much
+
+from philosophy, come to know it empirically, that _it is_. That is to
+
+be empiric. The criminal always work at one crime--that is the true
+
+criminal who seems predestinate to crime, and who will of none other.
+
+This criminal has not full man-brain. He is clever and cunning and
+
+resourceful; but he be not of man-stature as to brain. He be of
+
+child-brain in much. Now this criminal of ours is predestinate to crime
+
+also; he, too, have child-brain, and it is of the child to do what he
+
+have done. The little bird, the little fish, the little animal learn not
+
+by principle, but empirically; and when he learn to do, then there is to
+
+him the ground to start from to do more. �_Dos pou sto_,� said
+
+Archimedes. �Give me a fulcrum, and I shall move the world!� To do once,
+
+is the fulcrum whereby child-brain become man-brain; and until he have
+
+the purpose to do more, he continue to do the same again every time,
+
+just as he have done before! Oh, my dear, I see that your eyes are
+
+opened, and that to you the lightning flash show all the leagues,� for
+
+Mrs. Harker began to clap her hands and her eyes sparkled. He went on:--
+
+�Now you shall speak. Tell us two dry men of science what you see with
+
+those so bright eyes.� He took her hand and held it whilst she spoke.
+
+His finger and thumb closed on her pulse, as I thought instinctively and
+
+unconsciously, as she spoke:--
+
+�The Count is a criminal and of criminal type. Nordau and Lombroso would
+
+so classify him, and _qu�_ criminal he is of imperfectly formed mind.
+
+Thus, in a difficulty he has to seek resource in habit. His past is a
+
+clue, and the one page of it that we know--and that from his own
+
+lips--tells that once before, when in what Mr. Morris would call a
+
+�tight place,� he went back to his own country from the land he had
+
+tried to invade, and thence, without losing purpose, prepared himself
+
+for a new effort. He came again better equipped for his work; and won.
+
+So he came to London to invade a new land. He was beaten, and when all
+
+hope of success was lost, and his existence in danger, he fled back over
+
+the sea to his home; just as formerly he had fled back over the Danube
+
+from Turkey Land.�
+
+�Good, good! oh, you so clever lady!� said Van Helsing,
+
+enthusiastically, as he stooped and kissed her hand. A moment later he
+
+said to me, as calmly as though we had been having a sick-room
+
+consultation:--
+
+�Seventy-two only; and in all this excitement. I have hope.� Turning to
+
+her again, he said with keen expectation:--
+
+�But go on. Go on! there is more to tell if you will. Be not afraid;
+
+John and I know. I do in any case, and shall tell you if you are right.
+
+Speak, without fear!�
+
+�I will try to; but you will forgive me if I seem egotistical.�
+
+�Nay! fear not, you must be egotist, for it is of you that we think.�
+
+�Then, as he is criminal he is selfish; and as his intellect is small
+
+and his action is based on selfishness, he confines himself to one
+
+purpose. That purpose is remorseless. As he fled back over the Danube,
+
+leaving his forces to be cut to pieces, so now he is intent on being
+
+safe, careless of all. So his own selfishness frees my soul somewhat
+
+from the terrible power which he acquired over me on that dreadful
+
+night. I felt it! Oh, I felt it! Thank God, for His great mercy! My soul
+
+is freer than it has been since that awful hour; and all that haunts me
+
+is a fear lest in some trance or dream he may have used my knowledge for
+
+his ends.� The Professor stood up:--
+
+�He has so used your mind; and by it he has left us here in Varna,
+
+whilst the ship that carried him rushed through enveloping fog up to
+
+Galatz, where, doubtless, he had made preparation for escaping from us.
+
+But his child-mind only saw so far; and it may be that, as ever is in
+
+God�s Providence, the very thing that the evil-doer most reckoned on for
+
+his selfish good, turns out to be his chiefest harm. The hunter is taken
+
+in his own snare, as the great Psalmist says. For now that he think he
+
+is free from every trace of us all, and that he has escaped us with so
+
+many hours to him, then his selfish child-brain will whisper him to
+
+sleep. He think, too, that as he cut himself off from knowing your mind,
+
+there can be no knowledge of him to you; there is where he fail! That
+
+terrible baptism of blood which he give you makes you free to go to him
+
+in spirit, as you have as yet done in your times of freedom, when the
+
+sun rise and set. At such times you go by my volition and not by his;
+
+and this power to good of you and others, as you have won from your
+
+suffering at his hands. This is now all the more precious that he know
+
+it not, and to guard himself have even cut himself off from his
+
+knowledge of our where. We, however, are not selfish, and we believe
+
+that God is with us through all this blackness, and these many dark
+
+hours. We shall follow him; and we shall not flinch; even if we peril
+
+ourselves that we become like him. Friend John, this has been a great
+
+hour; and it have done much to advance us on our way. You must be scribe
+
+and write him all down, so that when the others return from their work
+
+you can give it to them; then they shall know as we do.�
+
+And so I have written it whilst we wait their return, and Mrs. Harker
+
+has written with her typewriter all since she brought the MS. to us.

+CHAPTER XVIII
+
+DR. SEWARD�S DIARY
+
+_30 September._--I got home at five o�clock, and found that Godalming
+
+and Morris had not only arrived, but had already studied the transcript
+
+of the various diaries and letters which Harker and his wonderful wife
+
+had made and arranged. Harker had not yet returned from his visit to the
+
+carriers� men, of whom Dr. Hennessey had written to me. Mrs. Harker gave
+
+us a cup of tea, and I can honestly say that, for the first time since I
+
+have lived in it, this old house seemed like _home_. When we had
+
+finished, Mrs. Harker said:--
+
+�Dr. Seward, may I ask a favour? I want to see your patient, Mr.
+
+Renfield. Do let me see him. What you have said of him in your diary
+
+interests me so much!� She looked so appealing and so pretty that I
+
+could not refuse her, and there was no possible reason why I should; so
+
+I took her with me. When I went into the room, I told the man that a
+
+lady would like to see him; to which he simply answered: �Why?�
+
+�She is going through the house, and wants to see every one in it,� I
+
+answered. �Oh, very well,� he said; �let her come in, by all means; but
+
+just wait a minute till I tidy up the place.� His method of tidying was
+
+peculiar: he simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes
+
+before I could stop him. It was quite evident that he feared, or was
+
+jealous of, some interference. When he had got through his disgusting
+
+task, he said cheerfully: �Let the lady come in,� and sat down on the
+
+edge of his bed with his head down, but with his eyelids raised so that
+
+he could see her as she entered. For a moment I thought that he might
+
+have some homicidal intent; I remembered how quiet he had been just
+
+before he attacked me in my own study, and I took care to stand where I
+
+could seize him at once if he attempted to make a spring at her. She
+
+came into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once command
+
+the respect of any lunatic--for easiness is one of the qualities mad
+
+people most respect. She walked over to him, smiling pleasantly, and
+
+held out her hand.
+
+�Good-evening, Mr. Renfield,� said she. �You see, I know you, for Dr.
+
+Seward has told me of you.� He made no immediate reply, but eyed her all
+
+over intently with a set frown on his face. This look gave way to one
+
+of wonder, which merged in doubt; then, to my intense astonishment, he
+
+said:--
+
+�You�re not the girl the doctor wanted to marry, are you? You can�t be,
+
+you know, for she�s dead.� Mrs. Harker smiled sweetly as she replied:--
+
+�Oh no! I have a husband of my own, to whom I was married before I ever
+
+saw Dr. Seward, or he me. I am Mrs. Harker.�
+
+�Then what are you doing here?�
+
+�My husband and I are staying on a visit with Dr. Seward.�
+
+�Then don�t stay.�
+
+�But why not?� I thought that this style of conversation might not be
+
+pleasant to Mrs. Harker, any more than it was to me, so I joined in:--
+
+�How did you know I wanted to marry any one?� His reply was simply
+
+contemptuous, given in a pause in which he turned his eyes from Mrs.
+
+Harker to me, instantly turning them back again:--
+
+�What an asinine question!�
+
+�I don�t see that at all, Mr. Renfield,� said Mrs. Harker, at once
+
+championing me. He replied to her with as much courtesy and respect as
+
+he had shown contempt to me:--
+
+�You will, of course, understand, Mrs. Harker, that when a man is so
+
+loved and honoured as our host is, everything regarding him is of
+
+interest in our little community. Dr. Seward is loved not only by his
+
+household and his friends, but even by his patients, who, being some of
+
+them hardly in mental equilibrium, are apt to distort causes and
+
+effects. Since I myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum, I
+
+cannot but notice that the sophistic tendencies of some of its inmates
+
+lean towards the errors of _non causa_ and _ignoratio elenchi_.� I
+
+positively opened my eyes at this new development. Here was my own pet
+
+lunatic--the most pronounced of his type that I had ever met
+
+with--talking elemental philosophy, and with the manner of a polished
+
+gentleman. I wonder if it was Mrs. Harker�s presence which had touched
+
+some chord in his memory. If this new phase was spontaneous, or in any
+
+way due to her unconscious influence, she must have some rare gift or
+
+power.
+
+We continued to talk for some time; and, seeing that he was seemingly
+
+quite reasonable, she ventured, looking at me questioningly as she
+
+began, to lead him to his favourite topic. I was again astonished, for
+
+he addressed himself to the question with the impartiality of the
+
+completest sanity; he even took himself as an example when he mentioned
+
+certain things.
+
+�Why, I myself am an instance of a man who had a strange belief. Indeed,
+
+it was no wonder that my friends were alarmed, and insisted on my being
+
+put under control. I used to fancy that life was a positive and
+
+perpetual entity, and that by consuming a multitude of live things, no
+
+matter how low in the scale of creation, one might indefinitely prolong
+
+life. At times I held the belief so strongly that I actually tried to
+
+take human life. The doctor here will bear me out that on one occasion I
+
+tried to kill him for the purpose of strengthening my vital powers by
+
+the assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of his
+
+blood--relying, of course, upon the Scriptural phrase, �For the blood is
+
+the life.� Though, indeed, the vendor of a certain nostrum has
+
+vulgarised the truism to the very point of contempt. Isn�t that true,
+
+doctor?� I nodded assent, for I was so amazed that I hardly knew what to
+
+either think or say; it was hard to imagine that I had seen him eat up
+
+his spiders and flies not five minutes before. Looking at my watch, I
+
+saw that I should go to the station to meet Van Helsing, so I told Mrs.
+
+Harker that it was time to leave. She came at once, after saying
+
+pleasantly to Mr. Renfield: �Good-bye, and I hope I may see you often,
+
+under auspices pleasanter to yourself,� to which, to my astonishment, he
+
+replied:--
+
+�Good-bye, my dear. I pray God I may never see your sweet face again.
+
+May He bless and keep you!�
+
+When I went to the station to meet Van Helsing I left the boys behind
+
+me. Poor Art seemed more cheerful than he has been since Lucy first took
+
+ill, and Quincey is more like his own bright self than he has been for
+
+many a long day.
+
+Van Helsing stepped from the carriage with the eager nimbleness of a
+
+boy. He saw me at once, and rushed up to me, saying:--
+
+�Ah, friend John, how goes all? Well? So! I have been busy, for I come
+
+here to stay if need be. All affairs are settled with me, and I have
+
+much to tell. Madam Mina is with you? Yes. And her so fine husband? And
+
+Arthur and my friend Quincey, they are with you, too? Good!�
+
+As I drove to the house I told him of what had passed, and of how my own
+
+diary had come to be of some use through Mrs. Harker�s suggestion; at
+
+which the Professor interrupted me:--
+
+�Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina! She has man�s brain--a brain that a man
+
+should have were he much gifted--and a woman�s heart. The good God
+
+fashioned her for a purpose, believe me, when He made that so good
+
+combination. Friend John, up to now fortune has made that woman of help
+
+to us; after to-night she must not have to do with this so terrible
+
+affair. It is not good that she run a risk so great. We men are
+
+determined--nay, are we not pledged?--to destroy this monster; but it is
+
+no part for a woman. Even if she be not harmed, her heart may fail her
+
+in so much and so many horrors; and hereafter she may suffer--both in
+
+waking, from her nerves, and in sleep, from her dreams. And, besides,
+
+she is young woman and not so long married; there may be other things to
+
+think of some time, if not now. You tell me she has wrote all, then she
+
+must consult with us; but to-morrow she say good-bye to this work, and
+
+we go alone.� I agreed heartily with him, and then I told him what we
+
+had found in his absence: that the house which Dracula had bought was
+
+the very next one to my own. He was amazed, and a great concern seemed
+
+to come on him. �Oh that we had known it before!� he said, �for then we
+
+might have reached him in time to save poor Lucy. However, �the milk
+
+that is spilt cries not out afterwards,� as you say. We shall not think
+
+of that, but go on our way to the end.� Then he fell into a silence that
+
+lasted till we entered my own gateway. Before we went to prepare for
+
+dinner he said to Mrs. Harker:--
+
+�I am told, Madam Mina, by my friend John that you and your husband have
+
+put up in exact order all things that have been, up to this moment.�
+
+�Not up to this moment, Professor,� she said impulsively, �but up to
+
+this morning.�
+
+�But why not up to now? We have seen hitherto how good light all the
+
+little things have made. We have told our secrets, and yet no one who
+
+has told is the worse for it.�
+
+Mrs. Harker began to blush, and taking a paper from her pockets, she
+
+said:--
+
+�Dr. Van Helsing, will you read this, and tell me if it must go in. It
+
+is my record of to-day. I too have seen the need of putting down at
+
+present everything, however trivial; but there is little in this except
+
+what is personal. Must it go in?� The Professor read it over gravely,
+
+and handed it back, saying:--
+
+�It need not go in if you do not wish it; but I pray that it may. It can
+
+but make your husband love you the more, and all us, your friends, more
+
+honour you--as well as more esteem and love.� She took it back with
+
+another blush and a bright smile.
+
+And so now, up to this very hour, all the records we have are complete
+
+and in order. The Professor took away one copy to study after dinner,
+
+and before our meeting, which is fixed for nine o�clock. The rest of us
+
+have already read everything; so when we meet in the study we shall all
+
+be informed as to facts, and can arrange our plan of battle with this
+
+terrible and mysterious enemy.
+
+_Mina Harker�s Journal._
+
+_30 September._--When we met in Dr. Seward�s study two hours after
+
+dinner, which had been at six o�clock, we unconsciously formed a sort of
+
+board or committee. Professor Van Helsing took the head of the table, to
+
+which Dr. Seward motioned him as he came into the room. He made me sit
+
+next to him on his right, and asked me to act as secretary; Jonathan sat
+
+next to me. Opposite us were Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr.
+
+Morris--Lord Godalming being next the Professor, and Dr. Seward in the
+
+centre. The Professor said:--
+
+�I may, I suppose, take it that we are all acquainted with the facts
+
+that are in these papers.� We all expressed assent, and he went on:--
+
+�Then it were, I think good that I tell you something of the kind of
+
+enemy with which we have to deal. I shall then make known to you
+
+something of the history of this man, which has been ascertained for me.
+
+So we then can discuss how we shall act, and can take our measure
+
+according.
+
+�There are such beings as vampires; some of us have evidence that they
+
+exist. Even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience, the
+
+teachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sane
+
+peoples. I admit that at the first I was sceptic. Were it not that
+
+through long years I have train myself to keep an open mind, I could not
+
+have believe until such time as that fact thunder on my ear. �See! see!
+
+I prove; I prove.� Alas! Had I known at the first what now I know--nay,
+
+had I even guess at him--one so precious life had been spared to many of
+
+us who did love her. But that is gone; and we must so work, that other
+
+poor souls perish not, whilst we can save. The _nosferatu_ do not die
+
+like the bee when he sting once. He is only stronger; and being
+
+stronger, have yet more power to work evil. This vampire which is
+
+amongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenty men; he is of
+
+cunning more than mortal, for his cunning be the growth of ages; he have
+
+still the aids of necromancy, which is, as his etymology imply, the
+
+divination by the dead, and all the dead that he can come nigh to are
+
+for him at command; he is brute, and more than brute; he is devil in
+
+callous, and the heart of him is not; he can, within limitations, appear
+
+at will when, and where, and in any of the forms that are to him; he
+
+can, within his range, direct the elements; the storm, the fog, the
+
+thunder; he can command all the meaner things: the rat, and the owl, and
+
+the bat--the moth, and the fox, and the wolf; he can grow and become
+
+small; and he can at times vanish and come unknown. How then are we to
+
+begin our strike to destroy him? How shall we find his where; and having
+
+found it, how can we destroy? My friends, this is much; it is a terrible
+
+task that we undertake, and there may be consequence to make the brave
+
+shudder. For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win; and then
+
+where end we? Life is nothings; I heed him not. But to fail here, is not
+
+mere life or death. It is that we become as him; that we henceforward
+
+become foul things of the night like him--without heart or conscience,
+
+preying on the bodies and the souls of those we love best. To us for
+
+ever are the gates of heaven shut; for who shall open them to us again?
+
+We go on for all time abhorred by all; a blot on the face of God�s
+
+sunshine; an arrow in the side of Him who died for man. But we are face
+
+to face with duty; and in such case must we shrink? For me, I say, no;
+
+but then I am old, and life, with his sunshine, his fair places, his
+
+song of birds, his music and his love, lie far behind. You others are
+
+young. Some have seen sorrow; but there are fair days yet in store. What
+
+say you?�
+
+Whilst he was speaking, Jonathan had taken my hand. I feared, oh so
+
+much, that the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming him when I
+
+saw his hand stretch out; but it was life to me to feel its touch--so
+
+strong, so self-reliant, so resolute. A brave man�s hand can speak for
+
+itself; it does not even need a woman�s love to hear its music.
+
+When the Professor had done speaking my husband looked in my eyes, and I
+
+in his; there was no need for speaking between us.
+
+�I answer for Mina and myself,� he said.
+
+�Count me in, Professor,� said Mr. Quincey Morris, laconically as usual.
+
+�I am with you,� said Lord Godalming, �for Lucy�s sake, if for no other
+
+reason.�
+
+Dr. Seward simply nodded. The Professor stood up and, after laying his
+
+golden crucifix on the table, held out his hand on either side. I took
+
+his right hand, and Lord Godalming his left; Jonathan held my right with
+
+his left and stretched across to Mr. Morris. So as we all took hands our
+
+solemn compact was made. I felt my heart icy cold, but it did not even
+
+occur to me to draw back. We resumed our places, and Dr. Van Helsing
+
+went on with a sort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious work
+
+had begun. It was to be taken as gravely, and in as businesslike a way,
+
+as any other transaction of life:--
+
+�Well, you know what we have to contend against; but we, too, are not
+
+without strength. We have on our side power of combination--a power
+
+denied to the vampire kind; we have sources of science; we are free to
+
+act and think; and the hours of the day and the night are ours equally.
+
+In fact, so far as our powers extend, they are unfettered, and we are
+
+free to use them. We have self-devotion in a cause, and an end to
+
+achieve which is not a selfish one. These things are much.
+
+�Now let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us are
+
+restrict, and how the individual cannot. In fine, let us consider the
+
+limitations of the vampire in general, and of this one in particular.
+
+�All we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions. These do not
+
+at the first appear much, when the matter is one of life and death--nay
+
+of more than either life or death. Yet must we be satisfied; in the
+
+first place because we have to be--no other means is at our control--and
+
+secondly, because, after all, these things--tradition and
+
+superstition--are everything. Does not the belief in vampires rest for
+
+others--though not, alas! for us--on them? A year ago which of us would
+
+have received such a possibility, in the midst of our scientific,
+
+sceptical, matter-of-fact nineteenth century? We even scouted a belief
+
+that we saw justified under our very eyes. Take it, then, that the
+
+vampire, and the belief in his limitations and his cure, rest for the
+
+moment on the same base. For, let me tell you, he is known everywhere
+
+that men have been. In old Greece, in old Rome; he flourish in Germany
+
+all over, in France, in India, even in the Chernosese; and in China, so
+
+far from us in all ways, there even is he, and the peoples fear him at
+
+this day. He have follow the wake of the berserker Icelander, the
+
+devil-begotten Hun, the Slav, the Saxon, the Magyar. So far, then, we
+
+have all we may act upon; and let me tell you that very much of the
+
+beliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappy
+
+experience. The vampire live on, and cannot die by mere passing of the
+
+time; he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of the
+
+living. Even more, we have seen amongst us that he can even grow
+
+younger; that his vital faculties grow strenuous, and seem as though
+
+they refresh themselves when his special pabulum is plenty. But he
+
+cannot flourish without this diet; he eat not as others. Even friend
+
+Jonathan, who lived with him for weeks, did never see him to eat, never!
+
+He throws no shadow; he make in the mirror no reflect, as again
+
+Jonathan observe. He has the strength of many of his hand--witness again
+
+Jonathan when he shut the door against the wolfs, and when he help him
+
+from the diligence too. He can transform himself to wolf, as we gather
+
+from the ship arrival in Whitby, when he tear open the dog; he can be as
+
+bat, as Madam Mina saw him on the window at Whitby, and as friend John
+
+saw him fly from this so near house, and as my friend Quincey saw him at
+
+the window of Miss Lucy. He can come in mist which he create--that noble
+
+ship�s captain proved him of this; but, from what we know, the distance
+
+he can make this mist is limited, and it can only be round himself. He
+
+come on moonlight rays as elemental dust--as again Jonathan saw those
+
+sisters in the castle of Dracula. He become so small--we ourselves saw
+
+Miss Lucy, ere she was at peace, slip through a hairbreadth space at the
+
+tomb door. He can, when once he find his way, come out from anything or
+
+into anything, no matter how close it be bound or even fused up with
+
+fire--solder you call it. He can see in the dark--no small power this,
+
+in a world which is one half shut from the light. Ah, but hear me
+
+through. He can do all these things, yet he is not free. Nay; he is even
+
+more prisoner than the slave of the galley, than the madman in his cell.
+
+He cannot go where he lists; he who is not of nature has yet to obey
+
+some of nature�s laws--why we know not. He may not enter anywhere at the
+
+first, unless there be some one of the household who bid him to come;
+
+though afterwards he can come as he please. His power ceases, as does
+
+that of all evil things, at the coming of the day. Only at certain times
+
+can he have limited freedom. If he be not at the place whither he is
+
+bound, he can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset.
+
+These things are we told, and in this record of ours we have proof by
+
+inference. Thus, whereas he can do as he will within his limit, when he
+
+have his earth-home, his coffin-home, his hell-home, the place
+
+unhallowed, as we saw when he went to the grave of the suicide at
+
+Whitby; still at other time he can only change when the time come. It is
+
+said, too, that he can only pass running water at the slack or the flood
+
+of the tide. Then there are things which so afflict him that he has no
+
+power, as the garlic that we know of; and as for things sacred, as this
+
+symbol, my crucifix, that was amongst us even now when we resolve, to
+
+them he is nothing, but in their presence he take his place far off and
+
+silent with respect. There are others, too, which I shall tell you of,
+
+lest in our seeking we may need them. The branch of wild rose on his
+
+coffin keep him that he move not from it; a sacred bullet fired into the
+
+coffin kill him so that he be true dead; and as for the stake through
+
+him, we know already of its peace; or the cut-off head that giveth rest.
+
+We have seen it with our eyes.
+
+�Thus when we find the habitation of this man-that-was, we can confine
+
+him to his coffin and destroy him, if we obey what we know. But he is
+
+clever. I have asked my friend Arminius, of Buda-Pesth University, to
+
+make his record; and, from all the means that are, he tell me of what he
+
+has been. He must, indeed, have been that Voivode Dracula who won his
+
+name against the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier of
+
+Turkey-land. If it be so, then was he no common man; for in that time,
+
+and for centuries after, he was spoken of as the cleverest and the most
+
+cunning, as well as the bravest of the sons of the �land beyond the
+
+forest.� That mighty brain and that iron resolution went with him to his
+
+grave, and are even now arrayed against us. The Draculas were, says
+
+Arminius, a great and noble race, though now and again were scions who
+
+were held by their coevals to have had dealings with the Evil One. They
+
+learned his secrets in the Scholomance, amongst the mountains over Lake
+
+Hermanstadt, where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due. In the
+
+records are such words as �stregoica�--witch, �ordog,� and
+
+�pokol�--Satan and hell; and in one manuscript this very Dracula is
+
+spoken of as �wampyr,� which we all understand too well. There have been
+
+from the loins of this very one great men and good women, and their
+
+graves make sacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell. For it
+
+is not the least of its terrors that this evil thing is rooted deep in
+
+all good; in soil barren of holy memories it cannot rest.�
+
+Whilst they were talking Mr. Morris was looking steadily at the window,
+
+and he now got up quietly, and went out of the room. There was a little
+
+pause, and then the Professor went on:--
+
+�And now we must settle what we do. We have here much data, and we must
+
+proceed to lay out our campaign. We know from the inquiry of Jonathan
+
+that from the castle to Whitby came fifty boxes of earth, all of which
+
+were delivered at Carfax; we also know that at least some of these boxes
+
+have been removed. It seems to me, that our first step should be to
+
+ascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond that wall
+
+where we look to-day; or whether any more have been removed. If the
+
+latter, we must trace----�
+
+Here we were interrupted in a very startling way. Outside the house came
+
+the sound of a pistol-shot; the glass of the window was shattered with a
+
+bullet, which, ricochetting from the top of the embrasure, struck the
+
+far wall of the room. I am afraid I am at heart a coward, for I shrieked
+
+out. The men all jumped to their feet; Lord Godalming flew over to the
+
+window and threw up the sash. As he did so we heard Mr. Morris�s voice
+
+without:--
+
+�Sorry! I fear I have alarmed you. I shall come in and tell you about
+
+it.� A minute later he came in and said:--
+
+�It was an idiotic thing of me to do, and I ask your pardon, Mrs.
+
+Harker, most sincerely; I fear I must have frightened you terribly. But
+
+the fact is that whilst the Professor was talking there came a big bat
+
+and sat on the window-sill. I have got such a horror of the damned
+
+brutes from recent events that I cannot stand them, and I went out to
+
+have a shot, as I have been doing of late of evenings, whenever I have
+
+seen one. You used to laugh at me for it then, Art.�
+
+�Did you hit it?� asked Dr. Van Helsing.
+
+�I don�t know; I fancy not, for it flew away into the wood.� Without
+
+saying any more he took his seat, and the Professor began to resume his
+
+statement:--
+
+�We must trace each of these boxes; and when we are ready, we must
+
+either capture or kill this monster in his lair; or we must, so to
+
+speak, sterilise the earth, so that no more he can seek safety in it.
+
+Thus in the end we may find him in his form of man between the hours of
+
+noon and sunset, and so engage with him when he is at his most weak.
+
+�And now for you, Madam Mina, this night is the end until all be well.
+
+You are too precious to us to have such risk. When we part to-night, you
+
+no more must question. We shall tell you all in good time. We are men
+
+and are able to bear; but you must be our star and our hope, and we
+
+shall act all the more free that you are not in the danger, such as we
+
+are.�
+
+All the men, even Jonathan, seemed relieved; but it did not seem to me
+
+good that they should brave danger and, perhaps, lessen their
+
+safety--strength being the best safety--through care of me; but their
+
+minds were made up, and, though it was a bitter pill for me to swallow,
+
+I could say nothing, save to accept their chivalrous care of me.
+
+Mr. Morris resumed the discussion:--
+
+�As there is no time to lose, I vote we have a look at his house right
+
+now. Time is everything with him; and swift action on our part may save
+
+another victim.�
+
+I own that my heart began to fail me when the time for action came so
+
+close, but I did not say anything, for I had a greater fear that if I
+
+appeared as a drag or a hindrance to their work, they might even leave
+
+me out of their counsels altogether. They have now gone off to Carfax,
+
+with means to get into the house.
+
+Manlike, they had told me to go to bed and sleep; as if a woman can
+
+sleep when those she loves are in danger! I shall lie down and pretend
+
+to sleep, lest Jonathan have added anxiety about me when he returns.
+
+_Dr. Seward�s Diary._
+
+_1 October, 4 a. m._--Just as we were about to leave the house, an
+
+urgent message was brought to me from Renfield to know if I would see
+
+him at once, as he had something of the utmost importance to say to me.
+
+I told the messenger to say that I would attend to his wishes in the
+
+morning; I was busy just at the moment. The attendant added:--
+
+�He seems very importunate, sir. I have never seen him so eager. I don�t
+
+know but what, if you don�t see him soon, he will have one of his
+
+violent fits.� I knew the man would not have said this without some
+
+cause, so I said: �All right; I�ll go now�; and I asked the others to
+
+wait a few minutes for me, as I had to go and see my �patient.�
+
+�Take me with you, friend John,� said the Professor. �His case in your
+
+diary interest me much, and it had bearing, too, now and again on _our_
+
+case. I should much like to see him, and especial when his mind is
+
+disturbed.�
+
+�May I come also?� asked Lord Godalming.
+
+�Me too?� said Quincey Morris. �May I come?� said Harker. I nodded, and
+
+we all went down the passage together.
+
+We found him in a state of considerable excitement, but far more
+
+rational in his speech and manner than I had ever seen him. There was an
+
+unusual understanding of himself, which was unlike anything I had ever
+
+met with in a lunatic; and he took it for granted that his reasons would
+
+prevail with others entirely sane. We all four went into the room, but
+
+none of the others at first said anything. His request was that I would
+
+at once release him from the asylum and send him home. This he backed up
+
+with arguments regarding his complete recovery, and adduced his own
+
+existing sanity. �I appeal to your friends,� he said, �they will,
+
+perhaps, not mind sitting in judgment on my case. By the way, you have
+
+not introduced me.� I was so much astonished, that the oddness of
+
+introducing a madman in an asylum did not strike me at the moment; and,
+
+besides, there was a certain dignity in the man�s manner, so much of
+
+the habit of equality, that I at once made the introduction: �Lord
+
+Godalming; Professor Van Helsing; Mr. Quincey Morris, of Texas; Mr.
+
+Renfield.� He shook hands with each of them, saying in turn:--
+
+�Lord Godalming, I had the honour of seconding your father at the
+
+Windham; I grieve to know, by your holding the title, that he is no
+
+more. He was a man loved and honoured by all who knew him; and in his
+
+youth was, I have heard, the inventor of a burnt rum punch, much
+
+patronised on Derby night. Mr. Morris, you should be proud of your great
+
+state. Its reception into the Union was a precedent which may have
+
+far-reaching effects hereafter, when the Pole and the Tropics may hold
+
+alliance to the Stars and Stripes. The power of Treaty may yet prove a
+
+vast engine of enlargement, when the Monroe doctrine takes its true
+
+place as a political fable. What shall any man say of his pleasure at
+
+meeting Van Helsing? Sir, I make no apology for dropping all forms of
+
+conventional prefix. When an individual has revolutionised therapeutics
+
+by his discovery of the continuous evolution of brain-matter,
+
+conventional forms are unfitting, since they would seem to limit him to
+
+one of a class. You, gentlemen, who by nationality, by heredity, or by
+
+the possession of natural gifts, are fitted to hold your respective
+
+places in the moving world, I take to witness that I am as sane as at
+
+least the majority of men who are in full possession of their liberties.
+
+And I am sure that you, Dr. Seward, humanitarian and medico-jurist as
+
+well as scientist, will deem it a moral duty to deal with me as one to
+
+be considered as under exceptional circumstances.� He made this last
+
+appeal with a courtly air of conviction which was not without its own
+
+charm.
+
+I think we were all staggered. For my own part, I was under the
+
+conviction, despite my knowledge of the man�s character and history,
+
+that his reason had been restored; and I felt under a strong impulse to
+
+tell him that I was satisfied as to his sanity, and would see about the
+
+necessary formalities for his release in the morning. I thought it
+
+better to wait, however, before making so grave a statement, for of old
+
+I knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was liable.
+
+So I contented myself with making a general statement that he appeared
+
+to be improving very rapidly; that I would have a longer chat with him
+
+in the morning, and would then see what I could do in the direction of
+
+meeting his wishes. This did not at all satisfy him, for he said
+
+quickly:--
+
+�But I fear, Dr. Seward, that you hardly apprehend my wish. I desire to
+
+go at once--here--now--this very hour--this very moment, if I may. Time
+
+presses, and in our implied agreement with the old scytheman it is of
+
+the essence of the contract. I am sure it is only necessary to put
+
+before so admirable a practitioner as Dr. Seward so simple, yet so
+
+momentous a wish, to ensure its fulfilment.� He looked at me keenly, and
+
+seeing the negative in my face, turned to the others, and scrutinised
+
+them closely. Not meeting any sufficient response, he went on:--
+
+�Is it possible that I have erred in my supposition?�
+
+�You have,� I said frankly, but at the same time, as I felt, brutally.
+
+There was a considerable pause, and then he said slowly:--
+
+�Then I suppose I must only shift my ground of request. Let me ask for
+
+this concession--boon, privilege, what you will. I am content to implore
+
+in such a case, not on personal grounds, but for the sake of others. I
+
+am not at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons; but you may, I
+
+assure you, take it from me that they are good ones, sound and
+
+unselfish, and spring from the highest sense of duty. Could you look,
+
+sir, into my heart, you would approve to the full the sentiments which
+
+animate me. Nay, more, you would count me amongst the best and truest of
+
+your friends.� Again he looked at us all keenly. I had a growing
+
+conviction that this sudden change of his entire intellectual method was
+
+but yet another form or phase of his madness, and so determined to let
+
+him go on a little longer, knowing from experience that he would, like
+
+all lunatics, give himself away in the end. Van Helsing was gazing at
+
+him with a look of utmost intensity, his bushy eyebrows almost meeting
+
+with the fixed concentration of his look. He said to Renfield in a tone
+
+which did not surprise me at the time, but only when I thought of it
+
+afterwards--for it was as of one addressing an equal:--
+
+�Can you not tell frankly your real reason for wishing to be free
+
+to-night? I will undertake that if you will satisfy even me--a stranger,
+
+without prejudice, and with the habit of keeping an open mind--Dr.
+
+Seward will give you, at his own risk and on his own responsibility, the
+
+privilege you seek.� He shook his head sadly, and with a look of
+
+poignant regret on his face. The Professor went on:--
+
+�Come, sir, bethink yourself. You claim the privilege of reason in the
+
+highest degree, since you seek to impress us with your complete
+
+reasonableness. You do this, whose sanity we have reason to doubt, since
+
+you are not yet released from medical treatment for this very defect. If
+
+you will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest course, how can
+
+we perform the duty which you yourself put upon us? Be wise, and help
+
+us; and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish.� He still shook
+
+his head as he said:--
+
+�Dr. Van Helsing, I have nothing to say. Your argument is complete, and
+
+if I were free to speak I should not hesitate a moment; but I am not my
+
+own master in the matter. I can only ask you to trust me. If I am
+
+refused, the responsibility does not rest with me.� I thought it was now
+
+time to end the scene, which was becoming too comically grave, so I went
+
+towards the door, simply saying:--
+
+�Come, my friends, we have work to do. Good-night.�
+
+As, however, I got near the door, a new change came over the patient. He
+
+moved towards me so quickly that for the moment I feared that he was
+
+about to make another homicidal attack. My fears, however, were
+
+groundless, for he held up his two hands imploringly, and made his
+
+petition in a moving manner. As he saw that the very excess of his
+
+emotion was militating against him, by restoring us more to our old
+
+relations, he became still more demonstrative. I glanced at Van Helsing,
+
+and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes; so I became a little more
+
+fixed in my manner, if not more stern, and motioned to him that his
+
+efforts were unavailing. I had previously seen something of the same
+
+constantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some request of
+
+which at the time he had thought much, such, for instance, as when he
+
+wanted a cat; and I was prepared to see the collapse into the same
+
+sullen acquiescence on this occasion. My expectation was not realised,
+
+for, when he found that his appeal would not be successful, he got into
+
+quite a frantic condition. He threw himself on his knees, and held up
+
+his hands, wringing them in plaintive supplication, and poured forth a
+
+torrent of entreaty, with the tears rolling down his cheeks, and his
+
+whole face and form expressive of the deepest emotion:--
+
+�Let me entreat you, Dr. Seward, oh, let me implore you, to let me out
+
+of this house at once. Send me away how you will and where you will;
+
+send keepers with me with whips and chains; let them take me in a
+
+strait-waistcoat, manacled and leg-ironed, even to a gaol; but let me go
+
+out of this. You don�t know what you do by keeping me here. I am
+
+speaking from the depths of my heart--of my very soul. You don�t know
+
+whom you wrong, or how; and I may not tell. Woe is me! I may not tell.
+
+By all you hold sacred--by all you hold dear--by your love that is
+
+lost--by your hope that lives--for the sake of the Almighty, take me out
+
+of this and save my soul from guilt! Can�t you hear me, man? Can�t you
+
+understand? Will you never learn? Don�t you know that I am sane and
+
+earnest now; that I am no lunatic in a mad fit, but a sane man fighting
+
+for his soul? Oh, hear me! hear me! Let me go! let me go! let me go!�
+
+I thought that the longer this went on the wilder he would get, and so
+
+would bring on a fit; so I took him by the hand and raised him up.
+
+�Come,� I said sternly, �no more of this; we have had quite enough
+
+already. Get to your bed and try to behave more discreetly.�
+
+He suddenly stopped and looked at me intently for several moments. Then,
+
+without a word, he rose and moving over, sat down on the side of the
+
+bed. The collapse had come, as on former occasion, just as I had
+
+expected.
+
+When I was leaving the room, last of our party, he said to me in a
+
+quiet, well-bred voice:--
+
+�You will, I trust, Dr. Seward, do me the justice to bear in mind, later
+
+on, that I did what I could to convince you to-night.�

+
+CUTTING FROM �THE DAILYGRAPH,� 8 AUGUST
+
+(_Pasted in Mina Murray�s Journal._)
+
+From a Correspondent.
+
+_Whitby_.
+
+One of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has just been
+
+experienced here, with results both strange and unique. The weather had
+
+been somewhat sultry, but not to any degree uncommon in the month of
+
+August. Saturday evening was as fine as was ever known, and the great
+
+body of holiday-makers laid out yesterday for visits to Mulgrave Woods,
+
+Robin Hood�s Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and the various trips in
+
+the neighbourhood of Whitby. The steamers _Emma_ and _Scarborough_ made
+
+trips up and down the coast, and there was an unusual amount of
+
+�tripping� both to and from Whitby. The day was unusually fine till the
+
+afternoon, when some of the gossips who frequent the East Cliff
+
+churchyard, and from that commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of
+
+sea visible to the north and east, called attention to a sudden show of
+
+�mares�-tails� high in the sky to the north-west. The wind was then
+
+blowing from the south-west in the mild degree which in barometrical
+
+language is ranked �No. 2: light breeze.� The coastguard on duty at once
+
+made report, and one old fisherman, who for more than half a century has
+
+kept watch on weather signs from the East Cliff, foretold in an emphatic
+
+manner the coming of a sudden storm. The approach of sunset was so very
+
+beautiful, so grand in its masses of splendidly-coloured clouds, that
+
+there was quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the old
+
+churchyard to enjoy the beauty. Before the sun dipped below the black
+
+mass of Kettleness, standing boldly athwart the western sky, its
+
+downward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunset-colour--flame,
+
+purple, pink, green, violet, and all the tints of gold; with here and
+
+there masses not large, but of seemingly absolute blackness, in all
+
+sorts of shapes, as well outlined as colossal silhouettes. The
+
+experience was not lost on the painters, and doubtless some of the
+
+sketches of the �Prelude to the Great Storm� will grace the R. A. and R.
+
+I. walls in May next. More than one captain made up his mind then and
+
+there that his �cobble� or his �mule,� as they term the different
+
+classes of boats, would remain in the harbour till the storm had passed.
+
+The wind fell away entirely during the evening, and at midnight there
+
+was a dead calm, a sultry heat, and that prevailing intensity which, on
+
+the approach of thunder, affects persons of a sensitive nature. There
+
+were but few lights in sight at sea, for even the coasting steamers,
+
+which usually �hug� the shore so closely, kept well to seaward, and but
+
+few fishing-boats were in sight. The only sail noticeable was a foreign
+
+schooner with all sails set, which was seemingly going westwards. The
+
+foolhardiness or ignorance of her officers was a prolific theme for
+
+comment whilst she remained in sight, and efforts were made to signal
+
+her to reduce sail in face of her danger. Before the night shut down she
+
+was seen with sails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating
+
+swell of the sea,
+
+�As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean.�
+
+Shortly before ten o�clock the stillness of the air grew quite
+
+oppressive, and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a sheep
+
+inland or the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly heard, and the
+
+band on the pier, with its lively French air, was like a discord in the
+
+great harmony of nature�s silence. A little after midnight came a
+
+strange sound from over the sea, and high overhead the air began to
+
+carry a strange, faint, hollow booming.
+
+Then without warning the tempest broke. With a rapidity which, at the
+
+time, seemed incredible, and even afterwards is impossible to realize,
+
+the whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed. The waves rose in
+
+growing fury, each overtopping its fellow, till in a very few minutes
+
+the lately glassy sea was like a roaring and devouring monster.
+
+White-crested waves beat madly on the level sands and rushed up the
+
+shelving cliffs; others broke over the piers, and with their spume swept
+
+the lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise from the end of either pier
+
+of Whitby Harbour. The wind roared like thunder, and blew with such
+
+force that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept their feet,
+
+or clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions. It was found necessary
+
+to clear the entire piers from the mass of onlookers, or else the
+
+fatalities of the night would have been increased manifold. To add to
+
+the difficulties and dangers of the time, masses of sea-fog came
+
+drifting inland--white, wet clouds, which swept by in ghostly fashion,
+
+so dank and damp and cold that it needed but little effort of
+
+imagination to think that the spirits of those lost at sea were
+
+touching their living brethren with the clammy hands of death, and many
+
+a one shuddered as the wreaths of sea-mist swept by. At times the mist
+
+cleared, and the sea for some distance could be seen in the glare of the
+
+lightning, which now came thick and fast, followed by such sudden peals
+
+of thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shock
+
+of the footsteps of the storm.
+
+Some of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and of
+
+absorbing interest--the sea, running mountains high, threw skywards with
+
+each wave mighty masses of white foam, which the tempest seemed to
+
+snatch at and whirl away into space; here and there a fishing-boat, with
+
+a rag of sail, running madly for shelter before the blast; now and again
+
+the white wings of a storm-tossed sea-bird. On the summit of the East
+
+Cliff the new searchlight was ready for experiment, but had not yet been
+
+tried. The officers in charge of it got it into working order, and in
+
+the pauses of the inrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea.
+
+Once or twice its service was most effective, as when a fishing-boat,
+
+with gunwale under water, rushed into the harbour, able, by the guidance
+
+of the sheltering light, to avoid the danger of dashing against the
+
+piers. As each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout of
+
+joy from the mass of people on shore, a shout which for a moment seemed
+
+to cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush.
+
+Before long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schooner
+
+with all sails set, apparently the same vessel which had been noticed
+
+earlier in the evening. The wind had by this time backed to the east,
+
+and there was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as they
+
+realized the terrible danger in which she now was. Between her and the
+
+port lay the great flat reef on which so many good ships have from time
+
+to time suffered, and, with the wind blowing from its present quarter,
+
+it would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of the
+
+harbour. It was now nearly the hour of high tide, but the waves were so
+
+great that in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almost
+
+visible, and the schooner, with all sails set, was rushing with such
+
+speed that, in the words of one old salt, �she must fetch up somewhere,
+
+if it was only in hell.� Then came another rush of sea-fog, greater than
+
+any hitherto--a mass of dank mist, which seemed to close on all things
+
+like a grey pall, and left available to men only the organ of hearing,
+
+for the roar of the tempest, and the crash of the thunder, and the
+
+booming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion even louder
+
+than before. The rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour
+
+mouth across the East Pier, where the shock was expected, and men waited
+
+breathless. The wind suddenly shifted to the north-east, and the remnant
+
+of the sea-fog melted in the blast; and then, _mirabile dictu_, between
+
+the piers, leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed,
+
+swept the strange schooner before the blast, with all sail set, and
+
+gained the safety of the harbour. The searchlight followed her, and a
+
+shudder ran through all who saw her, for lashed to the helm was a
+
+corpse, with drooping head, which swung horribly to and fro at each
+
+motion of the ship. No other form could be seen on deck at all. A great
+
+awe came on all as they realised that the ship, as if by a miracle, had
+
+found the harbour, unsteered save by the hand of a dead man! However,
+
+all took place more quickly than it takes to write these words. The
+
+schooner paused not, but rushing across the harbour, pitched herself on
+
+that accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many
+
+storms into the south-east corner of the pier jutting under the East
+
+Cliff, known locally as Tate Hill Pier.
+
+There was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up on
+
+the sand heap. Every spar, rope, and stay was strained, and some of the
+
+�top-hammer� came crashing down. But, strangest of all, the very instant
+
+the shore was touched, an immense dog sprang up on deck from below, as
+
+if shot up by the concussion, and running forward, jumped from the bow
+
+on the sand. Making straight for the steep cliff, where the churchyard
+
+hangs over the laneway to the East Pier so steeply that some of the flat
+
+tombstones--�thruff-steans� or �through-stones,� as they call them in
+
+the Whitby vernacular--actually project over where the sustaining cliff
+
+has fallen away, it disappeared in the darkness, which seemed
+
+intensified just beyond the focus of the searchlight.
+
+It so happened that there was no one at the moment on Tate Hill Pier, as
+
+all those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were
+
+out on the heights above. Thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern
+
+side of the harbour, who at once ran down to the little pier, was the
+
+first to climb on board. The men working the searchlight, after scouring
+
+the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything, then turned the
+
+light on the derelict and kept it there. The coastguard ran aft, and
+
+when he came beside the wheel, bent over to examine it, and recoiled at
+
+once as though under some sudden emotion. This seemed to pique general
+
+curiosity, and quite a number of people began to run. It is a good way
+
+round from the West Cliff by the Drawbridge to Tate Hill Pier, but your
+
+correspondent is a fairly good runner, and came well ahead of the crowd.
+
+When I arrived, however, I found already assembled on the pier a crowd,
+
+whom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board. By the
+
+courtesy of the chief boatman, I was, as your correspondent, permitted
+
+to climb on deck, and was one of a small group who saw the dead seaman
+
+whilst actually lashed to the wheel.
+
+It was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised, or even awed, for
+
+not often can such a sight have been seen. The man was simply fastened
+
+by his hands, tied one over the other, to a spoke of the wheel. Between
+
+the inner hand and the wood was a crucifix, the set of beads on which it
+
+was fastened being around both wrists and wheel, and all kept fast by
+
+the binding cords. The poor fellow may have been seated at one time, but
+
+the flapping and buffeting of the sails had worked through the rudder of
+
+the wheel and dragged him to and fro, so that the cords with which he
+
+was tied had cut the flesh to the bone. Accurate note was made of the
+
+state of things, and a doctor--Surgeon J. M. Caffyn, of 33, East Elliot
+
+Place--who came immediately after me, declared, after making
+
+examination, that the man must have been dead for quite two days. In his
+
+pocket was a bottle, carefully corked, empty save for a little roll of
+
+paper, which proved to be the addendum to the log. The coastguard said
+
+the man must have tied up his own hands, fastening the knots with his
+
+teeth. The fact that a coastguard was the first on board may save some
+
+complications, later on, in the Admiralty Court; for coastguards cannot
+
+claim the salvage which is the right of the first civilian entering on a
+
+derelict. Already, however, the legal tongues are wagging, and one young
+
+law student is loudly asserting that the rights of the owner are already
+
+completely sacrificed, his property being held in contravention of the
+
+statutes of mortmain, since the tiller, as emblemship, if not proof, of
+
+delegated possession, is held in a _dead hand_. It is needless to say
+
+that the dead steersman has been reverently removed from the place where
+
+he held his honourable watch and ward till death--a steadfastness as
+
+noble as that of the young Casabianca--and placed in the mortuary to
+
+await inquest.
+
+Already the sudden storm is passing, and its fierceness is abating;
+
+crowds are scattering homeward, and the sky is beginning to redden over
+
+the Yorkshire wolds. I shall send, in time for your next issue, further
+
+details of the derelict ship which found her way so miraculously into
+
+harbour in the storm.
+
+_Whitby_
+
+_9 August._--The sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the
+
+storm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself. It
+
+turns out that the schooner is a Russian from Varna, and is called the
+
+_Demeter_. She is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand, with only a
+
+small amount of cargo--a number of great wooden boxes filled with mould.
+
+This cargo was consigned to a Whitby solicitor, Mr. S. F. Billington, of
+
+7, The Crescent, who this morning went aboard and formally took
+
+possession of the goods consigned to him. The Russian consul, too,
+
+acting for the charter-party, took formal possession of the ship, and
+
+paid all harbour dues, etc. Nothing is talked about here to-day except
+
+the strange coincidence; the officials of the Board of Trade have been
+
+most exacting in seeing that every compliance has been made with
+
+existing regulations. As the matter is to be a �nine days� wonder,� they
+
+are evidently determined that there shall be no cause of after
+
+complaint. A good deal of interest was abroad concerning the dog which
+
+landed when the ship struck, and more than a few of the members of the
+
+S. P. C. A., which is very strong in Whitby, have tried to befriend the
+
+animal. To the general disappointment, however, it was not to be found;
+
+it seems to have disappeared entirely from the town. It may be that it
+
+was frightened and made its way on to the moors, where it is still
+
+hiding in terror. There are some who look with dread on such a
+
+possibility, lest later on it should in itself become a danger, for it
+
+is evidently a fierce brute. Early this morning a large dog, a half-bred
+
+mastiff belonging to a coal merchant close to Tate Hill Pier, was found
+
+dead in the roadway opposite to its master�s yard. It had been fighting,
+
+and manifestly had had a savage opponent, for its throat was torn away,
+
+and its belly was slit open as if with a savage claw.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_Later._--By the kindness of the Board of Trade inspector, I have been
+
+permitted to look over the log-book of the _Demeter_, which was in order
+
+up to within three days, but contained nothing of special interest
+
+except as to facts of missing men. The greatest interest, however, is
+
+with regard to the paper found in the bottle, which was to-day produced
+
+at the inquest; and a more strange narrative than the two between them
+
+unfold it has not been my lot to come across. As there is no motive for
+
+concealment, I am permitted to use them, and accordingly send you a
+
+rescript, simply omitting technical details of seamanship and
+
+supercargo. It almost seems as though the captain had been seized with
+
+some kind of mania before he had got well into blue water, and that
+
+this had developed persistently throughout the voyage. Of course my
+
+statement must be taken _cum grano_, since I am writing from the
+
+dictation of a clerk of the Russian consul, who kindly translated for
+
+me, time being short.
+
+LOG OF THE �DEMETER.�
+
+_Varna to Whitby._
+
+_Written 18 July, things so strange happening, that I shall keep
+
+accurate note henceforth till we land._
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+On 6 July we finished taking in cargo, silver sand and boxes of earth.
+
+At noon set sail. East wind, fresh. Crew, five hands ... two mates,
+
+cook, and myself (captain).
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+On 11 July at dawn entered Bosphorus. Boarded by Turkish Customs
+
+officers. Backsheesh. All correct. Under way at 4 p. m.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+On 12 July through Dardanelles. More Customs officers and flagboat of
+
+guarding squadron. Backsheesh again. Work of officers thorough, but
+
+quick. Want us off soon. At dark passed into Archipelago.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+On 13 July passed Cape Matapan. Crew dissatisfied about something.
+
+Seemed scared, but would not speak out.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+On 14 July was somewhat anxious about crew. Men all steady fellows, who
+
+sailed with me before. Mate could not make out what was wrong; they only
+
+told him there was _something_, and crossed themselves. Mate lost temper
+
+with one of them that day and struck him. Expected fierce quarrel, but
+
+all was quiet.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+On 16 July mate reported in the morning that one of crew, Petrofsky, was
+
+missing. Could not account for it. Took larboard watch eight bells last
+
+night; was relieved by Abramoff, but did not go to bunk. Men more
+
+downcast than ever. All said they expected something of the kind, but
+
+would not say more than there was _something_ aboard. Mate getting very
+
+impatient with them; feared some trouble ahead.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+On 17 July, yesterday, one of the men, Olgaren, came to my cabin, and in
+
+an awestruck way confided to me that he thought there was a strange man
+
+aboard the ship. He said that in his watch he had been sheltering
+
+behind the deck-house, as there was a rain-storm, when he saw a tall,
+
+thin man, who was not like any of the crew, come up the companion-way,
+
+and go along the deck forward, and disappear. He followed cautiously,
+
+but when he got to bows found no one, and the hatchways were all closed.
+
+He was in a panic of superstitious fear, and I am afraid the panic may
+
+spread. To allay it, I shall to-day search entire ship carefully from
+
+stem to stern.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+Later in the day I got together the whole crew, and told them, as they
+
+evidently thought there was some one in the ship, we would search from
+
+stem to stern. First mate angry; said it was folly, and to yield to such
+
+foolish ideas would demoralise the men; said he would engage to keep
+
+them out of trouble with a handspike. I let him take the helm, while the
+
+rest began thorough search, all keeping abreast, with lanterns: we left
+
+no corner unsearched. As there were only the big wooden boxes, there
+
+were no odd corners where a man could hide. Men much relieved when
+
+search over, and went back to work cheerfully. First mate scowled, but
+
+said nothing.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_22 July_.--Rough weather last three days, and all hands busy with
+
+sails--no time to be frightened. Men seem to have forgotten their dread.
+
+Mate cheerful again, and all on good terms. Praised men for work in bad
+
+weather. Passed Gibralter and out through Straits. All well.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_24 July_.--There seems some doom over this ship. Already a hand short,
+
+and entering on the Bay of Biscay with wild weather ahead, and yet last
+
+night another man lost--disappeared. Like the first, he came off his
+
+watch and was not seen again. Men all in a panic of fear; sent a round
+
+robin, asking to have double watch, as they fear to be alone. Mate
+
+angry. Fear there will be some trouble, as either he or the men will do
+
+some violence.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_28 July_.--Four days in hell, knocking about in a sort of maelstrom,
+
+and the wind a tempest. No sleep for any one. Men all worn out. Hardly
+
+know how to set a watch, since no one fit to go on. Second mate
+
+volunteered to steer and watch, and let men snatch a few hours� sleep.
+
+Wind abating; seas still terrific, but feel them less, as ship is
+
+steadier.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_29 July_.--Another tragedy. Had single watch to-night, as crew too
+
+tired to double. When morning watch came on deck could find no one
+
+except steersman. Raised outcry, and all came on deck. Thorough search,
+
+but no one found. Are now without second mate, and crew in a panic. Mate
+
+and I agreed to go armed henceforth and wait for any sign of cause.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_30 July_.--Last night. Rejoiced we are nearing England. Weather fine,
+
+all sails set. Retired worn out; slept soundly; awaked by mate telling
+
+me that both man of watch and steersman missing. Only self and mate and
+
+two hands left to work ship.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_1 August_.--Two days of fog, and not a sail sighted. Had hoped when in
+
+the English Channel to be able to signal for help or get in somewhere.
+
+Not having power to work sails, have to run before wind. Dare not lower,
+
+as could not raise them again. We seem to be drifting to some terrible
+
+doom. Mate now more demoralised than either of men. His stronger nature
+
+seems to have worked inwardly against himself. Men are beyond fear,
+
+working stolidly and patiently, with minds made up to worst. They are
+
+Russian, he Roumanian.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_2 August, midnight_.--Woke up from few minutes� sleep by hearing a cry,
+
+seemingly outside my port. Could see nothing in fog. Rushed on deck, and
+
+ran against mate. Tells me heard cry and ran, but no sign of man on
+
+watch. One more gone. Lord, help us! Mate says we must be past Straits
+
+of Dover, as in a moment of fog lifting he saw North Foreland, just as
+
+he heard the man cry out. If so we are now off in the North Sea, and
+
+only God can guide us in the fog, which seems to move with us; and God
+
+seems to have deserted us.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_3 August_.--At midnight I went to relieve the man at the wheel, and
+
+when I got to it found no one there. The wind was steady, and as we ran
+
+before it there was no yawing. I dared not leave it, so shouted for the
+
+mate. After a few seconds he rushed up on deck in his flannels. He
+
+looked wild-eyed and haggard, and I greatly fear his reason has given
+
+way. He came close to me and whispered hoarsely, with his mouth to my
+
+ear, as though fearing the very air might hear: �_It_ is here; I know
+
+it, now. On the watch last night I saw It, like a man, tall and thin,
+
+and ghastly pale. It was in the bows, and looking out. I crept behind
+
+It, and gave It my knife; but the knife went through It, empty as the
+
+air.� And as he spoke he took his knife and drove it savagely into
+
+space. Then he went on: �But It is here, and I�ll find It. It is in the
+
+hold, perhaps in one of those boxes. I�ll unscrew them one by one and
+
+see. You work the helm.� And, with a warning look and his finger on his
+
+lip, he went below. There was springing up a choppy wind, and I could
+
+not leave the helm. I saw him come out on deck again with a tool-chest
+
+and a lantern, and go down the forward hatchway. He is mad, stark,
+
+raving mad, and it�s no use my trying to stop him. He can�t hurt those
+
+big boxes: they are invoiced as �clay,� and to pull them about is as
+
+harmless a thing as he can do. So here I stay, and mind the helm, and
+
+write these notes. I can only trust in God and wait till the fog clears.
+
+Then, if I can�t steer to any harbour with the wind that is, I shall cut
+
+down sails and lie by, and signal for help....
+

+
+It is nearly all over now. Just as I was beginning to hope that the mate
+
+would come out calmer--for I heard him knocking away at something in the
+
+hold, and work is good for him--there came up the hatchway a sudden,
+
+startled scream, which made my blood run cold, and up on the deck he
+
+came as if shot from a gun--a raging madman, with his eyes rolling and
+
+his face convulsed with fear. �Save me! save me!� he cried, and then
+
+looked round on the blanket of fog. His horror turned to despair, and in
+
+a steady voice he said: �You had better come too, captain, before it is
+
+too late. _He_ is there. I know the secret now. The sea will save me
+
+from Him, and it is all that is left!� Before I could say a word, or
+
+move forward to seize him, he sprang on the bulwark and deliberately
+
+threw himself into the sea. I suppose I know the secret too, now. It was
+
+this madman who had got rid of the men one by one, and now he has
+
+followed them himself. God help me! How am I to account for all these
+
+horrors when I get to port? _When_ I get to port! Will that ever be?
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_4 August._--Still fog, which the sunrise cannot pierce. I know there is
+
+sunrise because I am a sailor, why else I know not. I dared not go
+
+below, I dared not leave the helm; so here all night I stayed, and in
+
+the dimness of the night I saw It--Him! God forgive me, but the mate was
+
+right to jump overboard. It was better to die like a man; to die like a
+
+sailor in blue water no man can object. But I am captain, and I must not
+
+leave my ship. But I shall baffle this fiend or monster, for I shall tie
+
+my hands to the wheel when my strength begins to fail, and along with
+
+them I shall tie that which He--It!--dare not touch; and then, come good
+
+wind or foul, I shall save my soul, and my honour as a captain. I am
+
+growing weaker, and the night is coming on. If He can look me in the
+
+face again, I may not have time to act.... If we are wrecked, mayhap
+
+this bottle may be found, and those who find it may understand; if not,
+
+... well, then all men shall know that I have been true to my trust. God
+
+and the Blessed Virgin and the saints help a poor ignorant soul trying
+
+to do his duty....
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+Of course the verdict was an open one. There is no evidence to adduce;
+
+and whether or not the man himself committed the murders there is now
+
+none to say. The folk here hold almost universally that the captain is
+
+simply a hero, and he is to be given a public funeral. Already it is
+
+arranged that his body is to be taken with a train of boats up the Esk
+
+for a piece and then brought back to Tate Hill Pier and up the abbey
+
+steps; for he is to be buried in the churchyard on the cliff. The owners
+
+of more than a hundred boats have already given in their names as
+
+wishing to follow him to the grave.
+
+No trace has ever been found of the great dog; at which there is much
+
+mourning, for, with public opinion in its present state, he would, I
+
+believe, be adopted by the town. To-morrow will see the funeral; and so
+
+will end this one more �mystery of the sea.�

+
+_8 August._--Lucy was very restless all night, and I, too, could not
+
+sleep. The storm was fearful, and as it boomed loudly among the
+
+chimney-pots, it made me shudder. When a sharp puff came it seemed to be
+
+like a distant gun. Strangely enough, Lucy did not wake; but she got up
+
+twice and dressed herself. Fortunately, each time I awoke in time and
+
+managed to undress her without waking her, and got her back to bed. It
+
+is a very strange thing, this sleep-walking, for as soon as her will is
+
+thwarted in any physical way, her intention, if there be any,
+
+disappears, and she yields herself almost exactly to the routine of her
+
+life.
+
+Early in the morning we both got up and went down to the harbour to see
+
+if anything had happened in the night. There were very few people about,
+
+and though the sun was bright, and the air clear and fresh, the big,
+
+grim-looking waves, that seemed dark themselves because the foam that
+
+topped them was like snow, forced themselves in through the narrow mouth
+
+of the harbour--like a bullying man going through a crowd. Somehow I
+
+felt glad that Jonathan was not on the sea last night, but on land. But,
+
+oh, is he on land or sea? Where is he, and how? I am getting fearfully
+
+anxious about him. If I only knew what to do, and could do anything!
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_10 August._--The funeral of the poor sea-captain to-day was most
+
+touching. Every boat in the harbour seemed to be there, and the coffin
+
+was carried by captains all the way from Tate Hill Pier up to the
+
+churchyard. Lucy came with me, and we went early to our old seat, whilst
+
+the cort�ge of boats went up the river to the Viaduct and came down
+
+again. We had a lovely view, and saw the procession nearly all the way.
+
+The poor fellow was laid to rest quite near our seat so that we stood on
+
+it when the time came and saw everything. Poor Lucy seemed much upset.
+
+She was restless and uneasy all the time, and I cannot but think that
+
+her dreaming at night is telling on her. She is quite odd in one thing:
+
+she will not admit to me that there is any cause for restlessness; or if
+
+there be, she does not understand it herself. There is an additional
+
+cause in that poor old Mr. Swales was found dead this morning on our
+
+seat, his neck being broken. He had evidently, as the doctor said,
+
+fallen back in the seat in some sort of fright, for there was a look of
+
+fear and horror on his face that the men said made them shudder. Poor
+
+dear old man! Perhaps he had seen Death with his dying eyes! Lucy is so
+
+sweet and sensitive that she feels influences more acutely than other
+
+people do. Just now she was quite upset by a little thing which I did
+
+not much heed, though I am myself very fond of animals. One of the men
+
+who came up here often to look for the boats was followed by his dog.
+
+The dog is always with him. They are both quiet persons, and I never saw
+
+the man angry, nor heard the dog bark. During the service the dog would
+
+not come to its master, who was on the seat with us, but kept a few
+
+yards off, barking and howling. Its master spoke to it gently, and then
+
+harshly, and then angrily; but it would neither come nor cease to make a
+
+noise. It was in a sort of fury, with its eyes savage, and all its hairs
+
+bristling out like a cat�s tail when puss is on the war-path. Finally
+
+the man, too, got angry, and jumped down and kicked the dog, and then
+
+took it by the scruff of the neck and half dragged and half threw it on
+
+the tombstone on which the seat is fixed. The moment it touched the
+
+stone the poor thing became quiet and fell all into a tremble. It did
+
+not try to get away, but crouched down, quivering and cowering, and was
+
+in such a pitiable state of terror that I tried, though without effect,
+
+to comfort it. Lucy was full of pity, too, but she did not attempt to
+
+touch the dog, but looked at it in an agonised sort of way. I greatly
+
+fear that she is of too super-sensitive a nature to go through the world
+
+without trouble. She will be dreaming of this to-night, I am sure. The
+
+whole agglomeration of things--the ship steered into port by a dead
+
+man; his attitude, tied to the wheel with a crucifix and beads; the
+
+touching funeral; the dog, now furious and now in terror--will all
+
+afford material for her dreams.
+
+I think it will be best for her to go to bed tired out physically, so I
+
+shall take her for a long walk by the cliffs to Robin Hood�s Bay and
+
+back. She ought not to have much inclination for sleep-walking then.

+CHAPTER XIII
+
+DR. SEWARD�S DIARY--_continued_.
+
+The funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day, so that Lucy and
+
+her mother might be buried together. I attended to all the ghastly
+
+formalities, and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff were
+
+afflicted--or blessed--with something of his own obsequious suavity.
+
+Even the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked to
+
+me, in a confidential, brother-professional way, when she had come out
+
+from the death-chamber:--
+
+�She makes a very beautiful corpse, sir. It�s quite a privilege to
+
+attend on her. It�s not too much to say that she will do credit to our
+
+establishment!�
+
+I noticed that Van Helsing never kept far away. This was possible from
+
+the disordered state of things in the household. There were no relatives
+
+at hand; and as Arthur had to be back the next day to attend at his
+
+father�s funeral, we were unable to notify any one who should have been
+
+bidden. Under the circumstances, Van Helsing and I took it upon
+
+ourselves to examine papers, etc. He insisted upon looking over Lucy�s
+
+papers himself. I asked him why, for I feared that he, being a
+
+foreigner, might not be quite aware of English legal requirements, and
+
+so might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble. He answered me:--
+
+�I know; I know. You forget that I am a lawyer as well as a doctor. But
+
+this is not altogether for the law. You knew that, when you avoided the
+
+coroner. I have more than him to avoid. There may be papers more--such
+
+as this.�
+
+As he spoke he took from his pocket-book the memorandum which had been
+
+in Lucy�s breast, and which she had torn in her sleep.
+
+�When you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late Mrs.
+
+Westenra, seal all her papers, and write him to-night. For me, I watch
+
+here in the room and in Miss Lucy�s old room all night, and I myself
+
+search for what may be. It is not well that her very thoughts go into
+
+the hands of strangers.�
+
+I went on with my part of the work, and in another half hour had found
+
+the name and address of Mrs. Westenra�s solicitor and had written to
+
+him. All the poor lady�s papers were in order; explicit directions
+
+regarding the place of burial were given. I had hardly sealed the
+
+letter, when, to my surprise, Van Helsing walked into the room,
+
+saying:--
+
+�Can I help you, friend John? I am free, and if I may, my service is to
+
+you.�
+
+�Have you got what you looked for?� I asked, to which he replied:--
+
+�I did not look for any specific thing. I only hoped to find, and find I
+
+have, all that there was--only some letters and a few memoranda, and a
+
+diary new begun. But I have them here, and we shall for the present say
+
+nothing of them. I shall see that poor lad to-morrow evening, and, with
+
+his sanction, I shall use some.�
+
+When we had finished the work in hand, he said to me:--
+
+�And now, friend John, I think we may to bed. We want sleep, both you
+
+and I, and rest to recuperate. To-morrow we shall have much to do, but
+
+for the to-night there is no need of us. Alas!�
+
+Before turning in we went to look at poor Lucy. The undertaker had
+
+certainly done his work well, for the room was turned into a small
+
+_chapelle ardente_. There was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers,
+
+and death was made as little repulsive as might be. The end of the
+
+winding-sheet was laid over the face; when the Professor bent over and
+
+turned it gently back, we both started at the beauty before us, the tall
+
+wax candles showing a sufficient light to note it well. All Lucy�s
+
+loveliness had come back to her in death, and the hours that had passed,
+
+instead of leaving traces of �decay�s effacing fingers,� had but
+
+restored the beauty of life, till positively I could not believe my eyes
+
+that I was looking at a corpse.
+
+The Professor looked sternly grave. He had not loved her as I had, and
+
+there was no need for tears in his eyes. He said to me: �Remain till I
+
+return,� and left the room. He came back with a handful of wild garlic
+
+from the box waiting in the hall, but which had not been opened, and
+
+placed the flowers amongst the others on and around the bed. Then he
+
+took from his neck, inside his collar, a little gold crucifix, and
+
+placed it over the mouth. He restored the sheet to its place, and we
+
+came away.
+
+I was undressing in my own room, when, with a premonitory tap at the
+
+door, he entered, and at once began to speak:--
+
+�To-morrow I want you to bring me, before night, a set of post-mortem
+
+knives.�
+
+�Must we make an autopsy?� I asked.
+
+�Yes and no. I want to operate, but not as you think. Let me tell you
+
+now, but not a word to another. I want to cut off her head and take out
+
+her heart. Ah! you a surgeon, and so shocked! You, whom I have seen with
+
+no tremble of hand or heart, do operations of life and death that make
+
+the rest shudder. Oh, but I must not forget, my dear friend John, that
+
+you loved her; and I have not forgotten it, for it is I that shall
+
+operate, and you must only help. I would like to do it to-night, but for
+
+Arthur I must not; he will be free after his father�s funeral to-morrow,
+
+and he will want to see her--to see _it_. Then, when she is coffined
+
+ready for the next day, you and I shall come when all sleep. We shall
+
+unscrew the coffin-lid, and shall do our operation: and then replace
+
+all, so that none know, save we alone.�
+
+�But why do it at all? The girl is dead. Why mutilate her poor body
+
+without need? And if there is no necessity for a post-mortem and nothing
+
+to gain by it--no good to her, to us, to science, to human
+
+knowledge--why do it? Without such it is monstrous.�
+
+For answer he put his hand on my shoulder, and said, with infinite
+
+tenderness:--
+
+�Friend John, I pity your poor bleeding heart; and I love you the more
+
+because it does so bleed. If I could, I would take on myself the burden
+
+that you do bear. But there are things that you know not, but that you
+
+shall know, and bless me for knowing, though they are not pleasant
+
+things. John, my child, you have been my friend now many years, and yet
+
+did you ever know me to do any without good cause? I may err--I am but
+
+man; but I believe in all I do. Was it not for these causes that you
+
+send for me when the great trouble came? Yes! Were you not amazed, nay
+
+horrified, when I would not let Arthur kiss his love--though she was
+
+dying--and snatched him away by all my strength? Yes! And yet you saw
+
+how she thanked me, with her so beautiful dying eyes, her voice, too, so
+
+weak, and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me? Yes! And did you not
+
+hear me swear promise to her, that so she closed her eyes grateful? Yes!
+
+�Well, I have good reason now for all I want to do. You have for many
+
+years trust me; you have believe me weeks past, when there be things so
+
+strange that you might have well doubt. Believe me yet a little, friend
+
+John. If you trust me not, then I must tell what I think; and that is
+
+not perhaps well. And if I work--as work I shall, no matter trust or no
+
+trust--without my friend trust in me, I work with heavy heart and feel,
+
+oh! so lonely when I want all help and courage that may be!� He paused a
+
+moment and went on solemnly: �Friend John, there are strange and
+
+terrible days before us. Let us not be two, but one, that so we work to
+
+a good end. Will you not have faith in me?�
+
+I took his hand, and promised him. I held my door open as he went away,
+
+and watched him go into his room and close the door. As I stood without
+
+moving, I saw one of the maids pass silently along the passage--she had
+
+her back towards me, so did not see me--and go into the room where Lucy
+
+lay. The sight touched me. Devotion is so rare, and we are so grateful
+
+to those who show it unasked to those we love. Here was a poor girl
+
+putting aside the terrors which she naturally had of death to go watch
+
+alone by the bier of the mistress whom she loved, so that the poor clay
+
+might not be lonely till laid to eternal rest....
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+I must have slept long and soundly, for it was broad daylight when Van
+
+Helsing waked me by coming into my room. He came over to my bedside and
+
+said:--
+
+�You need not trouble about the knives; we shall not do it.�
+
+�Why not?� I asked. For his solemnity of the night before had greatly
+
+impressed me.
+
+�Because,� he said sternly, �it is too late--or too early. See!� Here he
+
+held up the little golden crucifix. �This was stolen in the night.�
+
+�How, stolen,� I asked in wonder, �since you have it now?�
+
+�Because I get it back from the worthless wretch who stole it, from the
+
+woman who robbed the dead and the living. Her punishment will surely
+
+come, but not through me; she knew not altogether what she did and thus
+
+unknowing, she only stole. Now we must wait.�
+
+He went away on the word, leaving me with a new mystery to think of, a
+
+new puzzle to grapple with.
+
+The forenoon was a dreary time, but at noon the solicitor came: Mr.
+
+Marquand, of Wholeman, Sons, Marquand & Lidderdale. He was very genial
+
+and very appreciative of what we had done, and took off our hands all
+
+cares as to details. During lunch he told us that Mrs. Westenra had for
+
+some time expected sudden death from her heart, and had put her affairs
+
+in absolute order; he informed us that, with the exception of a certain
+
+entailed property of Lucy�s father�s which now, in default of direct
+
+issue, went back to a distant branch of the family, the whole estate,
+
+real and personal, was left absolutely to Arthur Holmwood. When he had
+
+told us so much he went on:--
+
+�Frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary disposition, and
+
+pointed out certain contingencies that might leave her daughter either
+
+penniless or not so free as she should be to act regarding a matrimonial
+
+alliance. Indeed, we pressed the matter so far that we almost came into
+
+collision, for she asked us if we were or were not prepared to carry out
+
+her wishes. Of course, we had then no alternative but to accept. We were
+
+right in principle, and ninety-nine times out of a hundred we should
+
+have proved, by the logic of events, the accuracy of our judgment.
+
+Frankly, however, I must admit that in this case any other form of
+
+disposition would have rendered impossible the carrying out of her
+
+wishes. For by her predeceasing her daughter the latter would have come
+
+into possession of the property, and, even had she only survived her
+
+mother by five minutes, her property would, in case there were no
+
+will--and a will was a practical impossibility in such a case--have been
+
+treated at her decease as under intestacy. In which case Lord Godalming,
+
+though so dear a friend, would have had no claim in the world; and the
+
+inheritors, being remote, would not be likely to abandon their just
+
+rights, for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger. I assure
+
+you, my dear sirs, I am rejoiced at the result, perfectly rejoiced.�
+
+He was a good fellow, but his rejoicing at the one little part--in which
+
+he was officially interested--of so great a tragedy, was an
+
+object-lesson in the limitations of sympathetic understanding.
+
+He did not remain long, but said he would look in later in the day and
+
+see Lord Godalming. His coming, however, had been a certain comfort to
+
+us, since it assured us that we should not have to dread hostile
+
+criticism as to any of our acts. Arthur was expected at five o�clock, so
+
+a little before that time we visited the death-chamber. It was so in
+
+very truth, for now both mother and daughter lay in it. The undertaker,
+
+true to his craft, had made the best display he could of his goods, and
+
+there was a mortuary air about the place that lowered our spirits at
+
+once. Van Helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adhered to,
+
+explaining that, as Lord Godalming was coming very soon, it would be
+
+less harrowing to his feelings to see all that was left of his _fianc�e_
+
+quite alone. The undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity and
+
+exerted himself to restore things to the condition in which we left them
+
+the night before, so that when Arthur came such shocks to his feelings
+
+as we could avoid were saved.
+
+Poor fellow! He looked desperately sad and broken; even his stalwart
+
+manhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of his
+
+much-tried emotions. He had, I knew, been very genuinely and devotedly
+
+attached to his father; and to lose him, and at such a time, was a
+
+bitter blow to him. With me he was warm as ever, and to Van Helsing he
+
+was sweetly courteous; but I could not help seeing that there was some
+
+constraint with him. The Professor noticed it, too, and motioned me to
+
+bring him upstairs. I did so, and left him at the door of the room, as I
+
+felt he would like to be quite alone with her, but he took my arm and
+
+led me in, saying huskily:--
+
+�You loved her too, old fellow; she told me all about it, and there was
+
+no friend had a closer place in her heart than you. I don�t know how to
+
+thank you for all you have done for her. I can�t think yet....�
+
+Here he suddenly broke down, and threw his arms round my shoulders and
+
+laid his head on my breast, crying:--
+
+�Oh, Jack! Jack! What shall I do! The whole of life seems gone from me
+
+all at once, and there is nothing in the wide world for me to live for.�
+
+I comforted him as well as I could. In such cases men do not need much
+
+expression. A grip of the hand, the tightening of an arm over the
+
+shoulder, a sob in unison, are expressions of sympathy dear to a man�s
+
+heart. I stood still and silent till his sobs died away, and then I said
+
+softly to him:--
+
+�Come and look at her.�
+
+Together we moved over to the bed, and I lifted the lawn from her face.
+
+God! how beautiful she was. Every hour seemed to be enhancing her
+
+loveliness. It frightened and amazed me somewhat; and as for Arthur, he
+
+fell a-trembling, and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague. At
+
+last, after a long pause, he said to me in a faint whisper:--
+
+�Jack, is she really dead?�
+
+I assured him sadly that it was so, and went on to suggest--for I felt
+
+that such a horrible doubt should not have life for a moment longer than
+
+I could help--that it often happened that after death faces became
+
+softened and even resolved into their youthful beauty; that this was
+
+especially so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolonged
+
+suffering. It seemed to quite do away with any doubt, and, after
+
+kneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at her lovingly and
+
+long, he turned aside. I told him that that must be good-bye, as the
+
+coffin had to be prepared; so he went back and took her dead hand in his
+
+and kissed it, and bent over and kissed her forehead. He came away,
+
+fondly looking back over his shoulder at her as he came.
+
+I left him in the drawing-room, and told Van Helsing that he had said
+
+good-bye; so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertaker�s men
+
+to proceed with the preparations and to screw up the coffin. When he
+
+came out of the room again I told him of Arthur�s question, and he
+
+replied:--
+
+�I am not surprised. Just now I doubted for a moment myself!�
+
+We all dined together, and I could see that poor Art was trying to make
+
+the best of things. Van Helsing had been silent all dinner-time; but
+
+when we had lit our cigars he said--
+
+�Lord----�; but Arthur interrupted him:--
+
+�No, no, not that, for God�s sake! not yet at any rate. Forgive me, sir:
+
+I did not mean to speak offensively; it is only because my loss is so
+
+recent.�
+
+The Professor answered very sweetly:--
+
+�I only used that name because I was in doubt. I must not call you
+
+�Mr.,� and I have grown to love you--yes, my dear boy, to love you--as
+
+Arthur.�
+
+Arthur held out his hand, and took the old man�s warmly.
+
+�Call me what you will,� he said. �I hope I may always have the title of
+
+a friend. And let me say that I am at a loss for words to thank you for
+
+your goodness to my poor dear.� He paused a moment, and went on: �I know
+
+that she understood your goodness even better than I do; and if I was
+
+rude or in any way wanting at that time you acted so--you remember�--the
+
+Professor nodded--�you must forgive me.�
+
+He answered with a grave kindness:--
+
+�I know it was hard for you to quite trust me then, for to trust such
+
+violence needs to understand; and I take it that you do not--that you
+
+cannot--trust me now, for you do not yet understand. And there may be
+
+more times when I shall want you to trust when you cannot--and may
+
+not--and must not yet understand. But the time will come when your trust
+
+shall be whole and complete in me, and when you shall understand as
+
+though the sunlight himself shone through. Then you shall bless me from
+
+first to last for your own sake, and for the sake of others and for her
+
+dear sake to whom I swore to protect.�
+
+�And, indeed, indeed, sir,� said Arthur warmly, �I shall in all ways
+
+trust you. I know and believe you have a very noble heart, and you are
+
+Jack�s friend, and you were hers. You shall do what you like.�
+
+The Professor cleared his throat a couple of times, as though about to
+
+speak, and finally said:--
+
+�May I ask you something now?�
+
+�Certainly.�
+
+�You know that Mrs. Westenra left you all her property?�
+
+�No, poor dear; I never thought of it.�
+
+�And as it is all yours, you have a right to deal with it as you will. I
+
+want you to give me permission to read all Miss Lucy�s papers and
+
+letters. Believe me, it is no idle curiosity. I have a motive of which,
+
+be sure, she would have approved. I have them all here. I took them
+
+before we knew that all was yours, so that no strange hand might touch
+
+them--no strange eye look through words into her soul. I shall keep
+
+them, if I may; even you may not see them yet, but I shall keep them
+
+safe. No word shall be lost; and in the good time I shall give them back
+
+to you. It�s a hard thing I ask, but you will do it, will you not, for
+
+Lucy�s sake?�
+
+Arthur spoke out heartily, like his old self:--
+
+�Dr. Van Helsing, you may do what you will. I feel that in saying this I
+
+am doing what my dear one would have approved. I shall not trouble you
+
+with questions till the time comes.�
+
+The old Professor stood up as he said solemnly:--
+
+�And you are right. There will be pain for us all; but it will not be
+
+all pain, nor will this pain be the last. We and you too--you most of
+
+all, my dear boy--will have to pass through the bitter water before we
+
+reach the sweet. But we must be brave of heart and unselfish, and do our
+
+duty, and all will be well!�
+
+I slept on a sofa in Arthur�s room that night. Van Helsing did not go to
+
+bed at all. He went to and fro, as if patrolling the house, and was
+
+never out of sight of the room where Lucy lay in her coffin, strewn with
+
+the wild garlic flowers, which sent, through the odour of lily and rose,
+
+a heavy, overpowering smell into the night.
+
+_Mina Harker�s Journal._
+
+_22 September._--In the train to Exeter. Jonathan sleeping.
+
+It seems only yesterday that the last entry was made, and yet how much
+
+between then, in Whitby and all the world before me, Jonathan away and
+
+no news of him; and now, married to Jonathan, Jonathan a solicitor, a
+
+partner, rich, master of his business, Mr. Hawkins dead and buried, and
+
+Jonathan with another attack that may harm him. Some day he may ask me
+
+about it. Down it all goes. I am rusty in my shorthand--see what
+
+unexpected prosperity does for us--so it may be as well to freshen it up
+
+again with an exercise anyhow....
+
+The service was very simple and very solemn. There were only ourselves
+
+and the servants there, one or two old friends of his from Exeter, his
+
+London agent, and a gentleman representing Sir John Paxton, the
+
+President of the Incorporated Law Society. Jonathan and I stood hand in
+
+hand, and we felt that our best and dearest friend was gone from us....
+
+We came back to town quietly, taking a �bus to Hyde Park Corner.
+
+Jonathan thought it would interest me to go into the Row for a while, so
+
+we sat down; but there were very few people there, and it was
+
+sad-looking and desolate to see so many empty chairs. It made us think
+
+of the empty chair at home; so we got up and walked down Piccadilly.
+
+Jonathan was holding me by the arm, the way he used to in old days
+
+before I went to school. I felt it very improper, for you can�t go on
+
+for some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls without the
+
+pedantry of it biting into yourself a bit; but it was Jonathan, and he
+
+was my husband, and we didn�t know anybody who saw us--and we didn�t
+
+care if they did--so on we walked. I was looking at a very beautiful
+
+girl, in a big cart-wheel hat, sitting in a victoria outside Guiliano�s,
+
+when I felt Jonathan clutch my arm so tight that he hurt me, and he said
+
+under his breath: �My God!� I am always anxious about Jonathan, for I
+
+fear that some nervous fit may upset him again; so I turned to him
+
+quickly, and asked him what it was that disturbed him.
+
+He was very pale, and his eyes seemed bulging out as, half in terror and
+
+half in amazement, he gazed at a tall, thin man, with a beaky nose and
+
+black moustache and pointed beard, who was also observing the pretty
+
+girl. He was looking at her so hard that he did not see either of us,
+
+and so I had a good view of him. His face was not a good face; it was
+
+hard, and cruel, and sensual, and his big white teeth, that looked all
+
+the whiter because his lips were so red, were pointed like an animal�s.
+
+Jonathan kept staring at him, till I was afraid he would notice. I
+
+feared he might take it ill, he looked so fierce and nasty. I asked
+
+Jonathan why he was disturbed, and he answered, evidently thinking that
+
+I knew as much about it as he did: �Do you see who it is?�
+
+�No, dear,� I said; �I don�t know him; who is it?� His answer seemed to
+
+shock and thrill me, for it was said as if he did not know that it was
+
+to me, Mina, to whom he was speaking:--
+
+�It is the man himself!�
+
+The poor dear was evidently terrified at something--very greatly
+
+terrified; I do believe that if he had not had me to lean on and to
+
+support him he would have sunk down. He kept staring; a man came out of
+
+the shop with a small parcel, and gave it to the lady, who then drove
+
+off. The dark man kept his eyes fixed on her, and when the carriage
+
+moved up Piccadilly he followed in the same direction, and hailed a
+
+hansom. Jonathan kept looking after him, and said, as if to himself:--
+
+�I believe it is the Count, but he has grown young. My God, if this be
+
+so! Oh, my God! my God! If I only knew! if I only knew!� He was
+
+distressing himself so much that I feared to keep his mind on the
+
+subject by asking him any questions, so I remained silent. I drew him
+
+away quietly, and he, holding my arm, came easily. We walked a little
+
+further, and then went in and sat for a while in the Green Park. It was
+
+a hot day for autumn, and there was a comfortable seat in a shady place.
+
+After a few minutes� staring at nothing, Jonathan�s eyes closed, and he
+
+went quietly into a sleep, with his head on my shoulder. I thought it
+
+was the best thing for him, so did not disturb him. In about twenty
+
+minutes he woke up, and said to me quite cheerfully:--
+
+�Why, Mina, have I been asleep! Oh, do forgive me for being so rude.
+
+Come, and we�ll have a cup of tea somewhere.� He had evidently forgotten
+
+all about the dark stranger, as in his illness he had forgotten all that
+
+this episode had reminded him of. I don�t like this lapsing into
+
+forgetfulness; it may make or continue some injury to the brain. I must
+
+not ask him, for fear I shall do more harm than good; but I must somehow
+
+learn the facts of his journey abroad. The time is come, I fear, when I
+
+must open that parcel, and know what is written. Oh, Jonathan, you will,
+
+I know, forgive me if I do wrong, but it is for your own dear sake.
+

+
+_Later._--A sad home-coming in every way--the house empty of the dear
+
+soul who was so good to us; Jonathan still pale and dizzy under a slight
+
+relapse of his malady; and now a telegram from Van Helsing, whoever he
+
+may be:--
+
+�You will be grieved to hear that Mrs. Westenra died five days ago, and
+
+that Lucy died the day before yesterday. They were both buried to-day.�
+
+Oh, what a wealth of sorrow in a few words! Poor Mrs. Westenra! poor
+
+Lucy! Gone, gone, never to return to us! And poor, poor Arthur, to have
+
+lost such sweetness out of his life! God help us all to bear our
+
+troubles.
+
+_Dr. Seward�s Diary._
+
+_22 September._--It is all over. Arthur has gone back to Ring, and has
+
+taken Quincey Morris with him. What a fine fellow is Quincey! I believe
+
+in my heart of hearts that he suffered as much about Lucy�s death as any
+
+of us; but he bore himself through it like a moral Viking. If America
+
+can go on breeding men like that, she will be a power in the world
+
+indeed. Van Helsing is lying down, having a rest preparatory to his
+
+journey. He goes over to Amsterdam to-night, but says he returns
+
+to-morrow night; that he only wants to make some arrangements which can
+
+only be made personally. He is to stop with me then, if he can; he says
+
+he has work to do in London which may take him some time. Poor old
+
+fellow! I fear that the strain of the past week has broken down even his
+
+iron strength. All the time of the burial he was, I could see, putting
+
+some terrible restraint on himself. When it was all over, we were
+
+standing beside Arthur, who, poor fellow, was speaking of his part in
+
+the operation where his blood had been transfused to his Lucy�s veins; I
+
+could see Van Helsing�s face grow white and purple by turns. Arthur was
+
+saying that he felt since then as if they two had been really married
+
+and that she was his wife in the sight of God. None of us said a word of
+
+the other operations, and none of us ever shall. Arthur and Quincey went
+
+away together to the station, and Van Helsing and I came on here. The
+
+moment we were alone in the carriage he gave way to a regular fit of
+
+hysterics. He has denied to me since that it was hysterics, and insisted
+
+that it was only his sense of humour asserting itself under very
+
+terrible conditions. He laughed till he cried, and I had to draw down
+
+the blinds lest any one should see us and misjudge; and then he cried,
+
+till he laughed again; and laughed and cried together, just as a woman
+
+does. I tried to be stern with him, as one is to a woman under the
+
+circumstances; but it had no effect. Men and women are so different in
+
+manifestations of nervous strength or weakness! Then when his face grew
+
+grave and stern again I asked him why his mirth, and why at such a time.
+
+His reply was in a way characteristic of him, for it was logical and
+
+forceful and mysterious. He said:--
+
+�Ah, you don�t comprehend, friend John. Do not think that I am not sad,
+
+though I laugh. See, I have cried even when the laugh did choke me. But
+
+no more think that I am all sorry when I cry, for the laugh he come
+
+just the same. Keep it always with you that laughter who knock at your
+
+door and say, �May I come in?� is not the true laughter. No! he is a
+
+king, and he come when and how he like. He ask no person; he choose no
+
+time of suitability. He say, �I am here.� Behold, in example I grieve my
+
+heart out for that so sweet young girl; I give my blood for her, though
+
+I am old and worn; I give my time, my skill, my sleep; I let my other
+
+sufferers want that so she may have all. And yet I can laugh at her very
+
+grave--laugh when the clay from the spade of the sexton drop upon her
+
+coffin and say �Thud! thud!� to my heart, till it send back the blood
+
+from my cheek. My heart bleed for that poor boy--that dear boy, so of
+
+the age of mine own boy had I been so blessed that he live, and with his
+
+hair and eyes the same. There, you know now why I love him so. And yet
+
+when he say things that touch my husband-heart to the quick, and make my
+
+father-heart yearn to him as to no other man--not even to you, friend
+
+John, for we are more level in experiences than father and son--yet even
+
+at such moment King Laugh he come to me and shout and bellow in my ear,
+
+�Here I am! here I am!� till the blood come dance back and bring some of
+
+the sunshine that he carry with him to my cheek. Oh, friend John, it is
+
+a strange world, a sad world, a world full of miseries, and woes, and
+
+troubles; and yet when King Laugh come he make them all dance to the
+
+tune he play. Bleeding hearts, and dry bones of the churchyard, and
+
+tears that burn as they fall--all dance together to the music that he
+
+make with that smileless mouth of him. And believe me, friend John, that
+
+he is good to come, and kind. Ah, we men and women are like ropes drawn
+
+tight with strain that pull us different ways. Then tears come; and,
+
+like the rain on the ropes, they brace us up, until perhaps the strain
+
+become too great, and we break. But King Laugh he come like the
+
+sunshine, and he ease off the strain again; and we bear to go on with
+
+our labour, what it may be.�
+
+I did not like to wound him by pretending not to see his idea; but, as I
+
+did not yet understand the cause of his laughter, I asked him. As he
+
+answered me his face grew stern, and he said in quite a different
+
+tone:--
+
+�Oh, it was the grim irony of it all--this so lovely lady garlanded with
+
+flowers, that looked so fair as life, till one by one we wondered if she
+
+were truly dead; she laid in that so fine marble house in that lonely
+
+churchyard, where rest so many of her kin, laid there with the mother
+
+who loved her, and whom she loved; and that sacred bell going �Toll!
+
+toll! toll!� so sad and slow; and those holy men, with the white
+
+garments of the angel, pretending to read books, and yet all the time
+
+their eyes never on the page; and all of us with the bowed head. And all
+
+for what? She is dead; so! Is it not?�
+
+�Well, for the life of me, Professor,� I said, �I can�t see anything to
+
+laugh at in all that. Why, your explanation makes it a harder puzzle
+
+than before. But even if the burial service was comic, what about poor
+
+Art and his trouble? Why, his heart was simply breaking.�
+
+�Just so. Said he not that the transfusion of his blood to her veins had
+
+made her truly his bride?�
+
+�Yes, and it was a sweet and comforting idea for him.�
+
+�Quite so. But there was a difficulty, friend John. If so that, then
+
+what about the others? Ho, ho! Then this so sweet maid is a polyandrist,
+
+and me, with my poor wife dead to me, but alive by Church�s law, though
+
+no wits, all gone--even I, who am faithful husband to this now-no-wife,
+
+am bigamist.�
+
+�I don�t see where the joke comes in there either!� I said; and I did
+
+not feel particularly pleased with him for saying such things. He laid
+
+his hand on my arm, and said:--
+
+�Friend John, forgive me if I pain. I showed not my feeling to others
+
+when it would wound, but only to you, my old friend, whom I can trust.
+
+If you could have looked into my very heart then when I want to laugh;
+
+if you could have done so when the laugh arrived; if you could do so
+
+now, when King Laugh have pack up his crown, and all that is to him--for
+
+he go far, far away from me, and for a long, long time--maybe you would
+
+perhaps pity me the most of all.�
+
+I was touched by the tenderness of his tone, and asked why.
+
+�Because I know!�
+
+And now we are all scattered; and for many a long day loneliness will
+
+sit over our roofs with brooding wings. Lucy lies in the tomb of her
+
+kin, a lordly death-house in a lonely churchyard, away from teeming
+
+London; where the air is fresh, and the sun rises over Hampstead Hill,
+
+and where wild flowers grow of their own accord.
+
+So I can finish this diary; and God only knows if I shall ever begin
+
+another. If I do, or if I even open this again, it will be to deal with
+
+different people and different themes; for here at the end, where the
+
+romance of my life is told, ere I go back to take up the thread of my
+
+life-work, I say sadly and without hope,
+
+�FINIS.�
+
+_�The Westminster Gazette,� 25 September._
+
+A HAMPSTEAD MYSTERY.
+
+The neighbourhood of Hampstead is just at present exercised with a
+
+series of events which seem to run on lines parallel to those of what
+
+was known to the writers of headlines as �The Kensington Horror,� or
+
+�The Stabbing Woman,� or �The Woman in Black.� During the past two or
+
+three days several cases have occurred of young children straying from
+
+home or neglecting to return from their playing on the Heath. In all
+
+these cases the children were too young to give any properly
+
+intelligible account of themselves, but the consensus of their excuses
+
+is that they had been with a �bloofer lady.� It has always been late in
+
+the evening when they have been missed, and on two occasions the
+
+children have not been found until early in the following morning. It is
+
+generally supposed in the neighbourhood that, as the first child missed
+
+gave as his reason for being away that a �bloofer lady� had asked him to
+
+come for a walk, the others had picked up the phrase and used it as
+
+occasion served. This is the more natural as the favourite game of the
+
+little ones at present is luring each other away by wiles. A
+
+correspondent writes us that to see some of the tiny tots pretending to
+
+be the �bloofer lady� is supremely funny. Some of our caricaturists
+
+might, he says, take a lesson in the irony of grotesque by comparing the
+
+reality and the picture. It is only in accordance with general
+
+principles of human nature that the �bloofer lady� should be the popular
+
+r�le at these _al fresco_ performances. Our correspondent na�vely says
+
+that even Ellen Terry could not be so winningly attractive as some of
+
+these grubby-faced little children pretend--and even imagine
+
+themselves--to be.
+
+There is, however, possibly a serious side to the question, for some of
+
+the children, indeed all who have been missed at night, have been
+
+slightly torn or wounded in the throat. The wounds seem such as might be
+
+made by a rat or a small dog, and although of not much importance
+
+individually, would tend to show that whatever animal inflicts them has
+
+a system or method of its own. The police of the division have been
+
+instructed to keep a sharp look-out for straying children, especially
+
+when very young, in and around Hampstead Heath, and for any stray dog
+
+which may be about.

+
+_Extra Special._
+
+THE HAMPSTEAD HORROR.
+
+ANOTHER CHILD INJURED.
+
+_The �Bloofer Lady.�_
+
+We have just received intelligence that another child, missed last
+
+night, was only discovered late in the morning under a furze bush at the
+
+Shooter�s Hill side of Hampstead Heath, which is, perhaps, less
+
+frequented than the other parts. It has the same tiny wound in the
+
+throat as has been noticed in other cases. It was terribly weak, and
+
+looked quite emaciated. It too, when partially restored, had the common
+
+story to tell of being lured away by the �bloofer lady.�

+CHAPTER XXIV
+
+DR. SEWARD�S PHONOGRAPH DIARY, SPOKEN BY VAN HELSING
+
+This to Jonathan Harker.
+
+You are to stay with your dear Madam Mina. We shall go to make our
+
+search--if I can call it so, for it is not search but knowing, and we
+
+seek confirmation only. But do you stay and take care of her to-day.
+
+This is your best and most holiest office. This day nothing can find him
+
+here. Let me tell you that so you will know what we four know already,
+
+for I have tell them. He, our enemy, have gone away; he have gone back
+
+to his Castle in Transylvania. I know it so well, as if a great hand of
+
+fire wrote it on the wall. He have prepare for this in some way, and
+
+that last earth-box was ready to ship somewheres. For this he took the
+
+money; for this he hurry at the last, lest we catch him before the sun
+
+go down. It was his last hope, save that he might hide in the tomb that
+
+he think poor Miss Lucy, being as he thought like him, keep open to him.
+
+But there was not of time. When that fail he make straight for his last
+
+resource--his last earth-work I might say did I wish _double entente_.
+
+He is clever, oh, so clever! he know that his game here was finish; and
+
+so he decide he go back home. He find ship going by the route he came,
+
+and he go in it. We go off now to find what ship, and whither bound;
+
+when we have discover that, we come back and tell you all. Then we will
+
+comfort you and poor dear Madam Mina with new hope. For it will be hope
+
+when you think it over: that all is not lost. This very creature that we
+
+pursue, he take hundreds of years to get so far as London; and yet in
+
+one day, when we know of the disposal of him we drive him out. He is
+
+finite, though he is powerful to do much harm and suffers not as we do.
+
+But we are strong, each in our purpose; and we are all more strong
+
+together. Take heart afresh, dear husband of Madam Mina. This battle is
+
+but begun, and in the end we shall win--so sure as that God sits on high
+
+to watch over His children. Therefore be of much comfort till we return.

+VAN HELSING.
+
+_Jonathan Harker�s Journal._
+
+_4 October._--When I read to Mina, Van Helsing�s message in the
+
+phonograph, the poor girl brightened up considerably. Already the
+
+certainty that the Count is out of the country has given her comfort;
+
+and comfort is strength to her. For my own part, now that his horrible
+
+danger is not face to face with us, it seems almost impossible to
+
+believe in it. Even my own terrible experiences in Castle Dracula seem
+
+like a long-forgotten dream. Here in the crisp autumn air in the bright
+
+sunlight----
+
+Alas! how can I disbelieve! In the midst of my thought my eye fell on
+
+the red scar on my poor darling�s white forehead. Whilst that lasts,
+
+there can be no disbelief. And afterwards the very memory of it will
+
+keep faith crystal clear. Mina and I fear to be idle, so we have been
+
+over all the diaries again and again. Somehow, although the reality
+
+seems greater each time, the pain and the fear seem less. There is
+
+something of a guiding purpose manifest throughout, which is comforting.
+
+Mina says that perhaps we are the instruments of ultimate good. It may
+
+be! I shall try to think as she does. We have never spoken to each other
+
+yet of the future. It is better to wait till we see the Professor and
+
+the others after their investigations.
+
+The day is running by more quickly than I ever thought a day could run
+
+for me again. It is now three o�clock.
+
+_Mina Harker�s Journal._
+
+_5 October, 5 p. m._--Our meeting for report. Present: Professor Van
+
+Helsing, Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, Mr. Quincey Morris, Jonathan
+
+Harker, Mina Harker.
+
+Dr. Van Helsing described what steps were taken during the day to
+
+discover on what boat and whither bound Count Dracula made his escape:--
+
+�As I knew that he wanted to get back to Transylvania, I felt sure that
+
+he must go by the Danube mouth; or by somewhere in the Black Sea, since
+
+by that way he come. It was a dreary blank that was before us. _Omne
+
+ignotum pro magnifico_; and so with heavy hearts we start to find what
+
+ships leave for the Black Sea last night. He was in sailing ship, since
+
+Madam Mina tell of sails being set. These not so important as to go in
+
+your list of the shipping in the _Times_, and so we go, by suggestion of
+
+Lord Godalming, to your Lloyd�s, where are note of all ships that sail,
+
+however so small. There we find that only one Black-Sea-bound ship go
+
+out with the tide. She is the _Czarina Catherine_, and she sail from
+
+Doolittle�s Wharf for Varna, and thence on to other parts and up the
+
+Danube. �Soh!� said I, �this is the ship whereon is the Count.� So off
+
+we go to Doolittle�s Wharf, and there we find a man in an office of wood
+
+so small that the man look bigger than the office. From him we inquire
+
+of the goings of the _Czarina Catherine_. He swear much, and he red face
+
+and loud of voice, but he good fellow all the same; and when Quincey
+
+give him something from his pocket which crackle as he roll it up, and
+
+put it in a so small bag which he have hid deep in his clothing, he
+
+still better fellow and humble servant to us. He come with us, and ask
+
+many men who are rough and hot; these be better fellows too when they
+
+have been no more thirsty. They say much of blood and bloom, and of
+
+others which I comprehend not, though I guess what they mean; but
+
+nevertheless they tell us all things which we want to know.
+
+�They make known to us among them, how last afternoon at about five
+
+o�clock comes a man so hurry. A tall man, thin and pale, with high nose
+
+and teeth so white, and eyes that seem to be burning. That he be all in
+
+black, except that he have a hat of straw which suit not him or the
+
+time. That he scatter his money in making quick inquiry as to what ship
+
+sails for the Black Sea and for where. Some took him to the office and
+
+then to the ship, where he will not go aboard but halt at shore end of
+
+gang-plank, and ask that the captain come to him. The captain come, when
+
+told that he will be pay well; and though he swear much at the first he
+
+agree to term. Then the thin man go and some one tell him where horse
+
+and cart can be hired. He go there and soon he come again, himself
+
+driving cart on which a great box; this he himself lift down, though it
+
+take several to put it on truck for the ship. He give much talk to
+
+captain as to how and where his box is to be place; but the captain like
+
+it not and swear at him in many tongues, and tell him that if he like he
+
+can come and see where it shall be. But he say �no�; that he come not
+
+yet, for that he have much to do. Whereupon the captain tell him that he
+
+had better be quick--with blood--for that his ship will leave the
+
+place--of blood--before the turn of the tide--with blood. Then the thin
+
+man smile and say that of course he must go when he think fit; but he
+
+will be surprise if he go quite so soon. The captain swear again,
+
+polyglot, and the thin man make him bow, and thank him, and say that he
+
+will so far intrude on his kindness as to come aboard before the
+
+sailing. Final the captain, more red than ever, and in more tongues tell
+
+him that he doesn�t want no Frenchmen--with bloom upon them and also
+
+with blood--in his ship--with blood on her also. And so, after asking
+
+where there might be close at hand a ship where he might purchase ship
+
+forms, he departed.
+
+�No one knew where he went �or bloomin� well cared,� as they said, for
+
+they had something else to think of--well with blood again; for it soon
+
+became apparent to all that the _Czarina Catherine_ would not sail as
+
+was expected. A thin mist began to creep up from the river, and it grew,
+
+and grew; till soon a dense fog enveloped the ship and all around her.
+
+The captain swore polyglot--very polyglot--polyglot with bloom and
+
+blood; but he could do nothing. The water rose and rose; and he began to
+
+fear that he would lose the tide altogether. He was in no friendly mood,
+
+when just at full tide, the thin man came up the gang-plank again and
+
+asked to see where his box had been stowed. Then the captain replied
+
+that he wished that he and his box--old and with much bloom and
+
+blood--were in hell. But the thin man did not be offend, and went down
+
+with the mate and saw where it was place, and came up and stood awhile
+
+on deck in fog. He must have come off by himself, for none notice him.
+
+Indeed they thought not of him; for soon the fog begin to melt away, and
+
+all was clear again. My friends of the thirst and the language that was
+
+of bloom and blood laughed, as they told how the captain�s swears
+
+exceeded even his usual polyglot, and was more than ever full of
+
+picturesque, when on questioning other mariners who were on movement up
+
+and down on the river that hour, he found that few of them had seen any
+
+of fog at all, except where it lay round the wharf. However, the ship
+
+went out on the ebb tide; and was doubtless by morning far down the
+
+river mouth. She was by then, when they told us, well out to sea.
+
+�And so, my dear Madam Mina, it is that we have to rest for a time, for
+
+our enemy is on the sea, with the fog at his command, on his way to the
+
+Danube mouth. To sail a ship takes time, go she never so quick; and when
+
+we start we go on land more quick, and we meet him there. Our best hope
+
+is to come on him when in the box between sunrise and sunset; for then
+
+he can make no struggle, and we may deal with him as we should. There
+
+are days for us, in which we can make ready our plan. We know all about
+
+where he go; for we have seen the owner of the ship, who have shown us
+
+invoices and all papers that can be. The box we seek is to be landed in
+
+Varna, and to be given to an agent, one Ristics who will there present
+
+his credentials; and so our merchant friend will have done his part.
+
+When he ask if there be any wrong, for that so, he can telegraph and
+
+have inquiry made at Varna, we say �no�; for what is to be done is not
+
+for police or of the customs. It must be done by us alone and in our own
+
+way.�
+
+When Dr. Van Helsing had done speaking, I asked him if he were certain
+
+that the Count had remained on board the ship. He replied: �We have the
+
+best proof of that: your own evidence, when in the hypnotic trance this
+
+morning.� I asked him again if it were really necessary that they should
+
+pursue the Count, for oh! I dread Jonathan leaving me, and I know that
+
+he would surely go if the others went. He answered in growing passion,
+
+at first quietly. As he went on, however, he grew more angry and more
+
+forceful, till in the end we could not but see wherein was at least some
+
+of that personal dominance which made him so long a master amongst
+
+men:--
+
+�Yes, it is necessary--necessary--necessary! For your sake in the first,
+
+and then for the sake of humanity. This monster has done much harm
+
+already, in the narrow scope where he find himself, and in the short
+
+time when as yet he was only as a body groping his so small measure in
+
+darkness and not knowing. All this have I told these others; you, my
+
+dear Madam Mina, will learn it in the phonograph of my friend John, or
+
+in that of your husband. I have told them how the measure of leaving his
+
+own barren land--barren of peoples--and coming to a new land where life
+
+of man teems till they are like the multitude of standing corn, was the
+
+work of centuries. Were another of the Un-Dead, like him, to try to do
+
+what he has done, perhaps not all the centuries of the world that have
+
+been, or that will be, could aid him. With this one, all the forces of
+
+nature that are occult and deep and strong must have worked together in
+
+some wondrous way. The very place, where he have been alive, Un-Dead for
+
+all these centuries, is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemical
+
+world. There are deep caverns and fissures that reach none know whither.
+
+There have been volcanoes, some of whose openings still send out waters
+
+of strange properties, and gases that kill or make to vivify. Doubtless,
+
+there is something magnetic or electric in some of these combinations of
+
+occult forces which work for physical life in strange way; and in
+
+himself were from the first some great qualities. In a hard and warlike
+
+time he was celebrate that he have more iron nerve, more subtle brain,
+
+more braver heart, than any man. In him some vital principle have in
+
+strange way found their utmost; and as his body keep strong and grow and
+
+thrive, so his brain grow too. All this without that diabolic aid which
+
+is surely to him; for it have to yield to the powers that come from,
+
+and are, symbolic of good. And now this is what he is to us. He have
+
+infect you--oh, forgive me, my dear, that I must say such; but it is for
+
+good of you that I speak. He infect you in such wise, that even if he do
+
+no more, you have only to live--to live in your own old, sweet way; and
+
+so in time, death, which is of man�s common lot and with God�s sanction,
+
+shall make you like to him. This must not be! We have sworn together
+
+that it must not. Thus are we ministers of God�s own wish: that the
+
+world, and men for whom His Son die, will not be given over to monsters,
+
+whose very existence would defame Him. He have allowed us to redeem one
+
+soul already, and we go out as the old knights of the Cross to redeem
+
+more. Like them we shall travel towards the sunrise; and like them, if
+
+we fall, we fall in good cause.� He paused and I said:--
+
+�But will not the Count take his rebuff wisely? Since he has been driven
+
+from England, will he not avoid it, as a tiger does the village from
+
+which he has been hunted?�
+
+�Aha!� he said, �your simile of the tiger good, for me, and I shall
+
+adopt him. Your man-eater, as they of India call the tiger who has once
+
+tasted blood of the human, care no more for the other prey, but prowl
+
+unceasing till he get him. This that we hunt from our village is a
+
+tiger, too, a man-eater, and he never cease to prowl. Nay, in himself he
+
+is not one to retire and stay afar. In his life, his living life, he go
+
+over the Turkey frontier and attack his enemy on his own ground; he be
+
+beaten back, but did he stay? No! He come again, and again, and again.
+
+Look at his persistence and endurance. With the child-brain that was to
+
+him he have long since conceive the idea of coming to a great city. What
+
+does he do? He find out the place of all the world most of promise for
+
+him. Then he deliberately set himself down to prepare for the task. He
+
+find in patience just how is his strength, and what are his powers. He
+
+study new tongues. He learn new social life; new environment of old
+
+ways, the politic, the law, the finance, the science, the habit of a new
+
+land and a new people who have come to be since he was. His glimpse that
+
+he have had, whet his appetite only and enkeen his desire. Nay, it help
+
+him to grow as to his brain; for it all prove to him how right he was at
+
+the first in his surmises. He have done this alone; all alone! from a
+
+ruin tomb in a forgotten land. What more may he not do when the greater
+
+world of thought is open to him. He that can smile at death, as we know
+
+him; who can flourish in the midst of diseases that kill off whole
+
+peoples. Oh, if such an one was to come from God, and not the Devil,
+
+what a force for good might he not be in this old world of ours. But we
+
+are pledged to set the world free. Our toil must be in silence, and our
+
+efforts all in secret; for in this enlightened age, when men believe not
+
+even what they see, the doubting of wise men would be his greatest
+
+strength. It would be at once his sheath and his armour, and his weapons
+
+to destroy us, his enemies, who are willing to peril even our own souls
+
+for the safety of one we love--for the good of mankind, and for the
+
+honour and glory of God.�
+
+After a general discussion it was determined that for to-night nothing
+
+be definitely settled; that we should all sleep on the facts, and try to
+
+think out the proper conclusions. To-morrow, at breakfast, we are to
+
+meet again, and, after making our conclusions known to one another, we
+
+shall decide on some definite cause of action.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+I feel a wonderful peace and rest to-night. It is as if some haunting
+
+presence were removed from me. Perhaps ...
+
+My surmise was not finished, could not be; for I caught sight in the
+
+mirror of the red mark upon my forehead; and I knew that I was still
+
+unclean.
+
+_Dr. Seward�s Diary._
+
+_5 October._--We all rose early, and I think that sleep did much for
+
+each and all of us. When we met at early breakfast there was more
+
+general cheerfulness than any of us had ever expected to experience
+
+again.
+
+It is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature. Let
+
+any obstructing cause, no matter what, be removed in any way--even by
+
+death--and we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment. More
+
+than once as we sat around the table, my eyes opened in wonder whether
+
+the whole of the past days had not been a dream. It was only when I
+
+caught sight of the red blotch on Mrs. Harker�s forehead that I was
+
+brought back to reality. Even now, when I am gravely revolving the
+
+matter, it is almost impossible to realise that the cause of all our
+
+trouble is still existent. Even Mrs. Harker seems to lose sight of her
+
+trouble for whole spells; it is only now and again, when something
+
+recalls it to her mind, that she thinks of her terrible scar. We are to
+
+meet here in my study in half an hour and decide on our course of
+
+action. I see only one immediate difficulty, I know it by instinct
+
+rather than reason: we shall all have to speak frankly; and yet I fear
+
+that in some mysterious way poor Mrs. Harker�s tongue is tied. I _know_
+
+that she forms conclusions of her own, and from all that has been I can
+
+guess how brilliant and how true they must be; but she will not, or
+
+cannot, give them utterance. I have mentioned this to Van Helsing, and
+
+he and I are to talk it over when we are alone. I suppose it is some of
+
+that horrid poison which has got into her veins beginning to work. The
+
+Count had his own purposes when he gave her what Van Helsing called �the
+
+Vampire�s baptism of blood.� Well, there may be a poison that distils
+
+itself out of good things; in an age when the existence of ptomaines is
+
+a mystery we should not wonder at anything! One thing I know: that if my
+
+instinct be true regarding poor Mrs. Harker�s silences, then there is a
+
+terrible difficulty--an unknown danger--in the work before us. The same
+
+power that compels her silence may compel her speech. I dare not think
+
+further; for so I should in my thoughts dishonour a noble woman!
+
+Van Helsing is coming to my study a little before the others. I shall
+
+try to open the subject with him.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_Later._--When the Professor came in, we talked over the state of
+
+things. I could see that he had something on his mind which he wanted to
+
+say, but felt some hesitancy about broaching the subject. After beating
+
+about the bush a little, he said suddenly:--
+
+�Friend John, there is something that you and I must talk of alone, just
+
+at the first at any rate. Later, we may have to take the others into our
+
+confidence�; then he stopped, so I waited; he went on:--
+
+�Madam Mina, our poor, dear Madam Mina is changing.� A cold shiver ran
+
+through me to find my worst fears thus endorsed. Van Helsing
+
+continued:--
+
+�With the sad experience of Miss Lucy, we must this time be warned
+
+before things go too far. Our task is now in reality more difficult than
+
+ever, and this new trouble makes every hour of the direst importance. I
+
+can see the characteristics of the vampire coming in her face. It is now
+
+but very, very slight; but it is to be seen if we have eyes to notice
+
+without to prejudge. Her teeth are some sharper, and at times her eyes
+
+are more hard. But these are not all, there is to her the silence now
+
+often; as so it was with Miss Lucy. She did not speak, even when she
+
+wrote that which she wished to be known later. Now my fear is this. If
+
+it be that she can, by our hypnotic trance, tell what the Count see and
+
+hear, is it not more true that he who have hypnotise her first, and who
+
+have drink of her very blood and make her drink of his, should, if he
+
+will, compel her mind to disclose to him that which she know?� I nodded
+
+acquiescence; he went on:--
+
+�Then, what we must do is to prevent this; we must keep her ignorant of
+
+our intent, and so she cannot tell what she know not. This is a painful
+
+task! Oh, so painful that it heart-break me to think of; but it must be.
+
+When to-day we meet, I must tell her that for reason which we will not
+
+to speak she must not more be of our council, but be simply guarded by
+
+us.� He wiped his forehead, which had broken out in profuse perspiration
+
+at the thought of the pain which he might have to inflict upon the poor
+
+soul already so tortured. I knew that it would be some sort of comfort
+
+to him if I told him that I also had come to the same conclusion; for at
+
+any rate it would take away the pain of doubt. I told him, and the
+
+effect was as I expected.
+
+It is now close to the time of our general gathering. Van Helsing has
+
+gone away to prepare for the meeting, and his painful part of it. I
+
+really believe his purpose is to be able to pray alone.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_Later._--At the very outset of our meeting a great personal relief was
+
+experienced by both Van Helsing and myself. Mrs. Harker had sent a
+
+message by her husband to say that she would not join us at present, as
+
+she thought it better that we should be free to discuss our movements
+
+without her presence to embarrass us. The Professor and I looked at each
+
+other for an instant, and somehow we both seemed relieved. For my own
+
+part, I thought that if Mrs. Harker realised the danger herself, it was
+
+much pain as well as much danger averted. Under the circumstances we
+
+agreed, by a questioning look and answer, with finger on lip, to
+
+preserve silence in our suspicions, until we should have been able to
+
+confer alone again. We went at once into our Plan of Campaign. Van
+
+Helsing roughly put the facts before us first:--
+
+�The _Czarina Catherine_ left the Thames yesterday morning. It will take
+
+her at the quickest speed she has ever made at least three weeks to
+
+reach Varna; but we can travel overland to the same place in three days.
+
+Now, if we allow for two days less for the ship�s voyage, owing to such
+
+weather influences as we know that the Count can bring to bear; and if
+
+we allow a whole day and night for any delays which may occur to us,
+
+then we have a margin of nearly two weeks. Thus, in order to be quite
+
+safe, we must leave here on 17th at latest. Then we shall at any rate
+
+be in Varna a day before the ship arrives, and able to make such
+
+preparations as may be necessary. Of course we shall all go armed--armed
+
+against evil things, spiritual as well as physical.� Here Quincey Morris
+
+added:--
+
+�I understand that the Count comes from a wolf country, and it may be
+
+that he shall get there before us. I propose that we add Winchesters to
+
+our armament. I have a kind of belief in a Winchester when there is any
+
+trouble of that sort around. Do you remember, Art, when we had the pack
+
+after us at Tobolsk? What wouldn�t we have given then for a repeater
+
+apiece!�
+
+�Good!� said Van Helsing, �Winchesters it shall be. Quincey�s head is
+
+level at all times, but most so when there is to hunt, metaphor be more
+
+dishonour to science than wolves be of danger to man. In the meantime we
+
+can do nothing here; and as I think that Varna is not familiar to any of
+
+us, why not go there more soon? It is as long to wait here as there.
+
+To-night and to-morrow we can get ready, and then, if all be well, we
+
+four can set out on our journey.�
+
+�We four?� said Harker interrogatively, looking from one to another of
+
+us.
+
+�Of course!� answered the Professor quickly, �you must remain to take
+
+care of your so sweet wife!� Harker was silent for awhile and then said
+
+in a hollow voice:--
+
+�Let us talk of that part of it in the morning. I want to consult with
+
+Mina.� I thought that now was the time for Van Helsing to warn him not
+
+to disclose our plans to her; but he took no notice. I looked at him
+
+significantly and coughed. For answer he put his finger on his lips and
+
+turned away.
+
+_Jonathan Harker�s Journal._
+
+_5 October, afternoon._--For some time after our meeting this morning I
+
+could not think. The new phases of things leave my mind in a state of
+
+wonder which allows no room for active thought. Mina�s determination not
+
+to take any part in the discussion set me thinking; and as I could not
+
+argue the matter with her, I could only guess. I am as far as ever from
+
+a solution now. The way the others received it, too, puzzled me; the
+
+last time we talked of the subject we agreed that there was to be no
+
+more concealment of anything amongst us. Mina is sleeping now, calmly
+
+and sweetly like a little child. Her lips are curved and her face beams
+
+with happiness. Thank God, there are such moments still for her.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_Later._--How strange it all is. I sat watching Mina�s happy sleep, and
+
+came as near to being happy myself as I suppose I shall ever be. As the
+
+evening drew on, and the earth took its shadows from the sun sinking
+
+lower, the silence of the room grew more and more solemn to me. All at
+
+once Mina opened her eyes, and looking at me tenderly, said:--
+
+�Jonathan, I want you to promise me something on your word of honour. A
+
+promise made to me, but made holily in God�s hearing, and not to be
+
+broken though I should go down on my knees and implore you with bitter
+
+tears. Quick, you must make it to me at once.�
+
+�Mina,� I said, �a promise like that, I cannot make at once. I may have
+
+no right to make it.�
+
+�But, dear one,� she said, with such spiritual intensity that her eyes
+
+were like pole stars, �it is I who wish it; and it is not for myself.
+
+You can ask Dr. Van Helsing if I am not right; if he disagrees you may
+
+do as you will. Nay, more, if you all agree, later, you are absolved
+
+from the promise.�
+
+�I promise!� I said, and for a moment she looked supremely happy; though
+
+to me all happiness for her was denied by the red scar on her forehead.
+
+She said:--
+
+�Promise me that you will not tell me anything of the plans formed for
+
+the campaign against the Count. Not by word, or inference, or
+
+implication; not at any time whilst this remains to me!� and she
+
+solemnly pointed to the scar. I saw that she was in earnest, and said
+
+solemnly:--
+
+�I promise!� and as I said it I felt that from that instant a door had
+
+been shut between us.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_Later, midnight._--Mina has been bright and cheerful all the evening.
+
+So much so that all the rest seemed to take courage, as if infected
+
+somewhat with her gaiety; as a result even I myself felt as if the pall
+
+of gloom which weighs us down were somewhat lifted. We all retired
+
+early. Mina is now sleeping like a little child; it is a wonderful thing
+
+that her faculty of sleep remains to her in the midst of her terrible
+
+trouble. Thank God for it, for then at least she can forget her care.
+
+Perhaps her example may affect me as her gaiety did to-night. I shall
+
+try it. Oh! for a dreamless sleep.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_6 October, morning._--Another surprise. Mina woke me early, about the
+
+same time as yesterday, and asked me to bring Dr. Van Helsing. I thought
+
+that it was another occasion for hypnotism, and without question went
+
+for the Professor. He had evidently expected some such call, for I found
+
+him dressed in his room. His door was ajar, so that he could hear the
+
+opening of the door of our room. He came at once; as he passed into the
+
+room, he asked Mina if the others might come, too.
+
+�No,� she said quite simply, �it will not be necessary. You can tell
+
+them just as well. I must go with you on your journey.�
+
+Dr. Van Helsing was as startled as I was. After a moment�s pause he
+
+asked:--
+
+�But why?�
+
+�You must take me with you. I am safer with you, and you shall be safer,
+
+too.�
+
+�But why, dear Madam Mina? You know that your safety is our solemnest
+
+duty. We go into danger, to which you are, or may be, more liable than
+
+any of us from--from circumstances--things that have been.� He paused,
+
+embarrassed.
+
+As she replied, she raised her finger and pointed to her forehead:--
+
+�I know. That is why I must go. I can tell you now, whilst the sun is
+
+coming up; I may not be able again. I know that when the Count wills me
+
+I must go. I know that if he tells me to come in secret, I must come by
+
+wile; by any device to hoodwink--even Jonathan.� God saw the look that
+
+she turned on me as she spoke, and if there be indeed a Recording Angel
+
+that look is noted to her everlasting honour. I could only clasp her
+
+hand. I could not speak; my emotion was too great for even the relief of
+
+tears. She went on:--
+
+�You men are brave and strong. You are strong in your numbers, for you
+
+can defy that which would break down the human endurance of one who had
+
+to guard alone. Besides, I may be of service, since you can hypnotise me
+
+and so learn that which even I myself do not know.� Dr. Van Helsing said
+
+very gravely:--
+
+�Madam Mina, you are, as always, most wise. You shall with us come; and
+
+together we shall do that which we go forth to achieve.� When he had
+
+spoken, Mina�s long spell of silence made me look at her. She had fallen
+
+back on her pillow asleep; she did not even wake when I had pulled up
+
+the blind and let in the sunlight which flooded the room. Van Helsing
+
+motioned to me to come with him quietly. We went to his room, and within
+
+a minute Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris were with us also.
+
+He told them what Mina had said, and went on:--
+
+�In the morning we shall leave for Varna. We have now to deal with a
+
+new factor: Madam Mina. Oh, but her soul is true. It is to her an agony
+
+to tell us so much as she has done; but it is most right, and we are
+
+warned in time. There must be no chance lost, and in Varna we must be
+
+ready to act the instant when that ship arrives.�
+
+�What shall we do exactly?� asked Mr. Morris laconically. The Professor
+
+paused before replying:--
+
+�We shall at the first board that ship; then, when we have identified
+
+the box, we shall place a branch of the wild rose on it. This we shall
+
+fasten, for when it is there none can emerge; so at least says the
+
+superstition. And to superstition must we trust at the first; it was
+
+man�s faith in the early, and it have its root in faith still. Then,
+
+when we get the opportunity that we seek, when none are near to see, we
+
+shall open the box, and--and all will be well.�
+
+�I shall not wait for any opportunity,� said Morris. �When I see the box
+
+I shall open it and destroy the monster, though there were a thousand
+
+men looking on, and if I am to be wiped out for it the next moment!� I
+
+grasped his hand instinctively and found it as firm as a piece of steel.
+
+I think he understood my look; I hope he did.
+
+�Good boy,� said Dr. Van Helsing. �Brave boy. Quincey is all man. God
+
+bless him for it. My child, believe me none of us shall lag behind or
+
+pause from any fear. I do but say what we may do--what we must do. But,
+
+indeed, indeed we cannot say what we shall do. There are so many things
+
+which may happen, and their ways and their ends are so various that
+
+until the moment we may not say. We shall all be armed, in all ways; and
+
+when the time for the end has come, our effort shall not be lack. Now
+
+let us to-day put all our affairs in order. Let all things which touch
+
+on others dear to us, and who on us depend, be complete; for none of us
+
+can tell what, or when, or how, the end may be. As for me, my own
+
+affairs are regulate; and as I have nothing else to do, I shall go make
+
+arrangements for the travel. I shall have all tickets and so forth for
+
+our journey.�
+
+There was nothing further to be said, and we parted. I shall now settle
+
+up all my affairs of earth, and be ready for whatever may come....
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_Later._--It is all done; my will is made, and all complete. Mina if she
+
+survive is my sole heir. If it should not be so, then the others who
+
+have been so good to us shall have remainder.
+
+It is now drawing towards the sunset; Mina�s uneasiness calls my
+
+attention to it. I am sure that there is something on her mind which the
+
+time of exact sunset will reveal. These occasions are becoming harrowing
+
+times for us all, for each sunrise and sunset opens up some new
+
+danger--some new pain, which, however, may in God�s will be means to a
+
+good end. I write all these things in the diary since my darling must
+
+not hear them now; but if it may be that she can see them again, they
+
+shall be ready.
+
+She is calling to me.

+CHAPTER XV
+
+DR. SEWARD�S DIARY--_continued_.
+
+For a while sheer anger mastered me; it was as if he had during her life
+
+struck Lucy on the face. I smote the table hard and rose up as I said to
+
+him:--
+
+�Dr. Van Helsing, are you mad?� He raised his head and looked at me, and
+
+somehow the tenderness of his face calmed me at once. �Would I were!� he
+
+said. �Madness were easy to bear compared with truth like this. Oh, my
+
+friend, why, think you, did I go so far round, why take so long to tell
+
+you so simple a thing? Was it because I hate you and have hated you all
+
+my life? Was it because I wished to give you pain? Was it that I wanted,
+
+now so late, revenge for that time when you saved my life, and from a
+
+fearful death? Ah no!�
+
+�Forgive me,� said I. He went on:--
+
+�My friend, it was because I wished to be gentle in the breaking to you,
+
+for I know you have loved that so sweet lady. But even yet I do not
+
+expect you to believe. It is so hard to accept at once any abstract
+
+truth, that we may doubt such to be possible when we have always
+
+believed the �no� of it; it is more hard still to accept so sad a
+
+concrete truth, and of such a one as Miss Lucy. To-night I go to prove
+
+it. Dare you come with me?�
+
+This staggered me. A man does not like to prove such a truth; Byron
+
+excepted from the category, jealousy.
+
+�And prove the very truth he most abhorred.�
+
+He saw my hesitation, and spoke:--
+
+�The logic is simple, no madman�s logic this time, jumping from tussock
+
+to tussock in a misty bog. If it be not true, then proof will be relief;
+
+at worst it will not harm. If it be true! Ah, there is the dread; yet
+
+very dread should help my cause, for in it is some need of belief. Come,
+
+I tell you what I propose: first, that we go off now and see that child
+
+in the hospital. Dr. Vincent, of the North Hospital, where the papers
+
+say the child is, is friend of mine, and I think of yours since you were
+
+in class at Amsterdam. He will let two scientists see his case, if he
+
+will not let two friends. We shall tell him nothing, but only that we
+
+wish to learn. And then----�
+
+�And then?� He took a key from his pocket and held it up. �And then we
+
+spend the night, you and I, in the churchyard where Lucy lies. This is
+
+the key that lock the tomb. I had it from the coffin-man to give to
+
+Arthur.� My heart sank within me, for I felt that there was some fearful
+
+ordeal before us. I could do nothing, however, so I plucked up what
+
+heart I could and said that we had better hasten, as the afternoon was
+
+passing....
+
+We found the child awake. It had had a sleep and taken some food, and
+
+altogether was going on well. Dr. Vincent took the bandage from its
+
+throat, and showed us the punctures. There was no mistaking the
+
+similarity to those which had been on Lucy�s throat. They were smaller,
+
+and the edges looked fresher; that was all. We asked Vincent to what he
+
+attributed them, and he replied that it must have been a bite of some
+
+animal, perhaps a rat; but, for his own part, he was inclined to think
+
+that it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern
+
+heights of London. �Out of so many harmless ones,� he said, �there may
+
+be some wild specimen from the South of a more malignant species. Some
+
+sailor may have brought one home, and it managed to escape; or even from
+
+the Zo�logical Gardens a young one may have got loose, or one be bred
+
+there from a vampire. These things do occur, you know. Only ten days ago
+
+a wolf got out, and was, I believe, traced up in this direction. For a
+
+week after, the children were playing nothing but Red Riding Hood on the
+
+Heath and in every alley in the place until this �bloofer lady� scare
+
+came along, since when it has been quite a gala-time with them. Even
+
+this poor little mite, when he woke up to-day, asked the nurse if he
+
+might go away. When she asked him why he wanted to go, he said he wanted
+
+to play with the �bloofer lady.��
+
+�I hope,� said Van Helsing, �that when you are sending the child home
+
+you will caution its parents to keep strict watch over it. These fancies
+
+to stray are most dangerous; and if the child were to remain out another
+
+night, it would probably be fatal. But in any case I suppose you will
+
+not let it away for some days?�
+
+�Certainly not, not for a week at least; longer if the wound is not
+
+healed.�
+
+Our visit to the hospital took more time than we had reckoned on, and
+
+the sun had dipped before we came out. When Van Helsing saw how dark it
+
+was, he said:--
+
+�There is no hurry. It is more late than I thought. Come, let us seek
+
+somewhere that we may eat, and then we shall go on our way.�
+
+We dined at �Jack Straw�s Castle� along with a little crowd of
+
+bicyclists and others who were genially noisy. About ten o�clock we
+
+started from the inn. It was then very dark, and the scattered lamps
+
+made the darkness greater when we were once outside their individual
+
+radius. The Professor had evidently noted the road we were to go, for he
+
+went on unhesitatingly; but, as for me, I was in quite a mixup as to
+
+locality. As we went further, we met fewer and fewer people, till at
+
+last we were somewhat surprised when we met even the patrol of horse
+
+police going their usual suburban round. At last we reached the wall of
+
+the churchyard, which we climbed over. With some little difficulty--for
+
+it was very dark, and the whole place seemed so strange to us--we found
+
+the Westenra tomb. The Professor took the key, opened the creaky door,
+
+and standing back, politely, but quite unconsciously, motioned me to
+
+precede him. There was a delicious irony in the offer, in the
+
+courtliness of giving preference on such a ghastly occasion. My
+
+companion followed me quickly, and cautiously drew the door to, after
+
+carefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling, and not a spring,
+
+one. In the latter case we should have been in a bad plight. Then he
+
+fumbled in his bag, and taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle,
+
+proceeded to make a light. The tomb in the day-time, and when wreathed
+
+with fresh flowers, had looked grim and gruesome enough; but now, some
+
+days afterwards, when the flowers hung lank and dead, their whites
+
+turning to rust and their greens to browns; when the spider and the
+
+beetle had resumed their accustomed dominance; when time-discoloured
+
+stone, and dust-encrusted mortar, and rusty, dank iron, and tarnished
+
+brass, and clouded silver-plating gave back the feeble glimmer of a
+
+candle, the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have been
+
+imagined. It conveyed irresistibly the idea that life--animal life--was
+
+not the only thing which could pass away.
+
+Van Helsing went about his work systematically. Holding his candle so
+
+that he could read the coffin plates, and so holding it that the sperm
+
+dropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal, he
+
+made assurance of Lucy�s coffin. Another search in his bag, and he took
+
+out a turnscrew.
+
+�What are you going to do?� I asked.
+
+�To open the coffin. You shall yet be convinced.� Straightway he began
+
+taking out the screws, and finally lifted off the lid, showing the
+
+casing of lead beneath. The sight was almost too much for me. It seemed
+
+to be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to have
+
+stripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living; I actually took
+
+hold of his hand to stop him. He only said: �You shall see,� and again
+
+fumbling in his bag, took out a tiny fret-saw. Striking the turnscrew
+
+through the lead with a swift downward stab, which made me wince, he
+
+made a small hole, which was, however, big enough to admit the point of
+
+the saw. I had expected a rush of gas from the week-old corpse. We
+
+doctors, who have had to study our dangers, have to become accustomed to
+
+such things, and I drew back towards the door. But the Professor never
+
+stopped for a moment; he sawed down a couple of feet along one side of
+
+the lead coffin, and then across, and down the other side. Taking the
+
+edge of the loose flange, he bent it back towards the foot of the
+
+coffin, and holding up the candle into the aperture, motioned to me to
+
+look.
+
+I drew near and looked. The coffin was empty.
+
+It was certainly a surprise to me, and gave me a considerable shock, but
+
+Van Helsing was unmoved. He was now more sure than ever of his ground,
+
+and so emboldened to proceed in his task. �Are you satisfied now, friend
+
+John?� he asked.
+
+I felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within me as
+
+I answered him:--
+
+�I am satisfied that Lucy�s body is not in that coffin; but that only
+
+proves one thing.�
+
+�And what is that, friend John?�
+
+�That it is not there.�
+
+�That is good logic,� he said, �so far as it goes. But how do you--how
+
+can you--account for it not being there?�
+
+�Perhaps a body-snatcher,� I suggested. �Some of the undertaker�s people
+
+may have stolen it.� I felt that I was speaking folly, and yet it was
+
+the only real cause which I could suggest. The Professor sighed. �Ah
+
+well!� he said, �we must have more proof. Come with me.�
+
+He put on the coffin-lid again, gathered up all his things and placed
+
+them in the bag, blew out the light, and placed the candle also in the
+
+bag. We opened the door, and went out. Behind us he closed the door and
+
+locked it. He handed me the key, saying: �Will you keep it? You had
+
+better be assured.� I laughed--it was not a very cheerful laugh, I am
+
+bound to say--as I motioned him to keep it. �A key is nothing,� I said;
+
+�there may be duplicates; and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lock
+
+of that kind.� He said nothing, but put the key in his pocket. Then he
+
+told me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he would watch at
+
+the other. I took up my place behind a yew-tree, and I saw his dark
+
+figure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my
+
+sight.
+
+It was a lonely vigil. Just after I had taken my place I heard a distant
+
+clock strike twelve, and in time came one and two. I was chilled and
+
+unnerved, and angry with the Professor for taking me on such an errand
+
+and with myself for coming. I was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly
+
+observant, and not sleepy enough to betray my trust so altogether I had
+
+a dreary, miserable time.
+
+Suddenly, as I turned round, I thought I saw something like a white
+
+streak, moving between two dark yew-trees at the side of the churchyard
+
+farthest from the tomb; at the same time a dark mass moved from the
+
+Professor�s side of the ground, and hurriedly went towards it. Then I
+
+too moved; but I had to go round headstones and railed-off tombs, and I
+
+stumbled over graves. The sky was overcast, and somewhere far off an
+
+early cock crew. A little way off, beyond a line of scattered
+
+juniper-trees, which marked the pathway to the church, a white, dim
+
+figure flitted in the direction of the tomb. The tomb itself was hidden
+
+by trees, and I could not see where the figure disappeared. I heard the
+
+rustle of actual movement where I had first seen the white figure, and
+
+coming over, found the Professor holding in his arms a tiny child. When
+
+he saw me he held it out to me, and said:--
+
+�Are you satisfied now?�
+
+�No,� I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive.
+
+�Do you not see the child?�
+
+�Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here? And is it wounded?� I
+
+asked.
+
+�We shall see,� said the Professor, and with one impulse we took our way
+
+out of the churchyard, he carrying the sleeping child.
+
+When we had got some little distance away, we went into a clump of
+
+trees, and struck a match, and looked at the child�s throat. It was
+
+without a scratch or scar of any kind.
+
+�Was I right?� I asked triumphantly.
+
+�We were just in time,� said the Professor thankfully.
+
+We had now to decide what we were to do with the child, and so consulted
+
+about it. If we were to take it to a police-station we should have to
+
+give some account of our movements during the night; at least, we should
+
+have had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child.
+
+So finally we decided that we would take it to the Heath, and when we
+
+heard a policeman coming, would leave it where he could not fail to find
+
+it; we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could. All fell out
+
+well. At the edge of Hampstead Heath we heard a policeman�s heavy
+
+tramp, and laying the child on the pathway, we waited and watched until
+
+he saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro. We heard his exclamation
+
+of astonishment, and then we went away silently. By good chance we got a
+
+cab near the �Spaniards,� and drove to town.
+
+I cannot sleep, so I make this entry. But I must try to get a few hours�
+
+sleep, as Van Helsing is to call for me at noon. He insists that I shall
+
+go with him on another expedition.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_27 September._--It was two o�clock before we found a suitable
+
+opportunity for our attempt. The funeral held at noon was all completed,
+
+and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazily
+
+away, when, looking carefully from behind a clump of alder-trees, we saw
+
+the sexton lock the gate after him. We knew then that we were safe till
+
+morning did we desire it; but the Professor told me that we should not
+
+want more than an hour at most. Again I felt that horrid sense of the
+
+reality of things, in which any effort of imagination seemed out of
+
+place; and I realised distinctly the perils of the law which we were
+
+incurring in our unhallowed work. Besides, I felt it was all so useless.
+
+Outrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin, to see if a woman dead
+
+nearly a week were really dead, it now seemed the height of folly to
+
+open the tomb again, when we knew, from the evidence of our own
+
+eyesight, that the coffin was empty. I shrugged my shoulders, however,
+
+and rested silent, for Van Helsing had a way of going on his own road,
+
+no matter who remonstrated. He took the key, opened the vault, and again
+
+courteously motioned me to precede. The place was not so gruesome as
+
+last night, but oh, how unutterably mean-looking when the sunshine
+
+streamed in. Van Helsing walked over to Lucy�s coffin, and I followed.
+
+He bent over and again forced back the leaden flange; and then a shock
+
+of surprise and dismay shot through me.
+
+There lay Lucy, seemingly just as we had seen her the night before her
+
+funeral. She was, if possible, more radiantly beautiful than ever; and I
+
+could not believe that she was dead. The lips were red, nay redder than
+
+before; and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom.
+
+�Is this a juggle?� I said to him.
+
+�Are you convinced now?� said the Professor in response, and as he spoke
+
+he put over his hand, and in a way that made me shudder, pulled back the
+
+dead lips and showed the white teeth.
+
+�See,� he went on, �see, they are even sharper than before. With this
+
+and this�--and he touched one of the canine teeth and that below
+
+it--�the little children can be bitten. Are you of belief now, friend
+
+John?� Once more, argumentative hostility woke within me. I _could_ not
+
+accept such an overwhelming idea as he suggested; so, with an attempt to
+
+argue of which I was even at the moment ashamed, I said:--
+
+�She may have been placed here since last night.�
+
+�Indeed? That is so, and by whom?�
+
+�I do not know. Some one has done it.�
+
+�And yet she has been dead one week. Most peoples in that time would not
+
+look so.� I had no answer for this, so was silent. Van Helsing did not
+
+seem to notice my silence; at any rate, he showed neither chagrin nor
+
+triumph. He was looking intently at the face of the dead woman, raising
+
+the eyelids and looking at the eyes, and once more opening the lips and
+
+examining the teeth. Then he turned to me and said:--
+
+�Here, there is one thing which is different from all recorded; here is
+
+some dual life that is not as the common. She was bitten by the vampire
+
+when she was in a trance, sleep-walking--oh, you start; you do not know
+
+that, friend John, but you shall know it all later--and in trance could
+
+he best come to take more blood. In trance she died, and in trance she
+
+is Un-Dead, too. So it is that she differ from all other. Usually when
+
+the Un-Dead sleep at home�--as he spoke he made a comprehensive sweep of
+
+his arm to designate what to a vampire was �home�--�their face show what
+
+they are, but this so sweet that was when she not Un-Dead she go back to
+
+the nothings of the common dead. There is no malign there, see, and so
+
+it make hard that I must kill her in her sleep.� This turned my blood
+
+cold, and it began to dawn upon me that I was accepting Van Helsing�s
+
+theories; but if she were really dead, what was there of terror in the
+
+idea of killing her? He looked up at me, and evidently saw the change in
+
+my face, for he said almost joyously:--
+
+�Ah, you believe now?�
+
+I answered: �Do not press me too hard all at once. I am willing to
+
+accept. How will you do this bloody work?�
+
+�I shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic, and I shall
+
+drive a stake through her body.� It made me shudder to think of so
+
+mutilating the body of the woman whom I had loved. And yet the feeling
+
+was not so strong as I had expected. I was, in fact, beginning to
+
+shudder at the presence of this being, this Un-Dead, as Van Helsing
+
+called it, and to loathe it. Is it possible that love is all subjective,
+
+or all objective?
+
+I waited a considerable time for Van Helsing to begin, but he stood as
+
+if wrapped in thought. Presently he closed the catch of his bag with a
+
+snap, and said:--
+
+�I have been thinking, and have made up my mind as to what is best. If I
+
+did simply follow my inclining I would do now, at this moment, what is
+
+to be done; but there are other things to follow, and things that are
+
+thousand times more difficult in that them we do not know. This is
+
+simple. She have yet no life taken, though that is of time; and to act
+
+now would be to take danger from her for ever. But then we may have to
+
+want Arthur, and how shall we tell him of this? If you, who saw the
+
+wounds on Lucy�s throat, and saw the wounds so similar on the child�s at
+
+the hospital; if you, who saw the coffin empty last night and full
+
+to-day with a woman who have not change only to be more rose and more
+
+beautiful in a whole week, after she die--if you know of this and know
+
+of the white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyard,
+
+and yet of your own senses you did not believe, how, then, can I expect
+
+Arthur, who know none of those things, to believe? He doubted me when I
+
+took him from her kiss when she was dying. I know he has forgiven me
+
+because in some mistaken idea I have done things that prevent him say
+
+good-bye as he ought; and he may think that in some more mistaken idea
+
+this woman was buried alive; and that in most mistake of all we have
+
+killed her. He will then argue back that it is we, mistaken ones, that
+
+have killed her by our ideas; and so he will be much unhappy always. Yet
+
+he never can be sure; and that is the worst of all. And he will
+
+sometimes think that she he loved was buried alive, and that will paint
+
+his dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered; and again, he
+
+will think that we may be right, and that his so beloved was, after all,
+
+an Un-Dead. No! I told him once, and since then I learn much. Now, since
+
+I know it is all true, a hundred thousand times more do I know that he
+
+must pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet. He, poor fellow,
+
+must have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow black to
+
+him; then we can act for good all round and send him peace. My mind is
+
+made up. Let us go. You return home for to-night to your asylum, and see
+
+that all be well. As for me, I shall spend the night here in this
+
+churchyard in my own way. To-morrow night you will come to me to the
+
+Berkeley Hotel at ten of the clock. I shall send for Arthur to come too,
+
+and also that so fine young man of America that gave his blood. Later we
+
+shall all have work to do. I come with you so far as Piccadilly and
+
+there dine, for I must be back here before the sun set.�
+
+So we locked the tomb and came away, and got over the wall of the
+
+churchyard, which was not much of a task, and drove back to Piccadilly.
+
+_Note left by Van Helsing in his portmanteau, Berkeley Hotel directed to
+
+John Seward, M. D._
+
+(Not delivered.)
+
+�_27 September._
+
+�Friend John,--
+
+�I write this in case anything should happen. I go alone to watch in
+
+that churchyard. It pleases me that the Un-Dead, Miss Lucy, shall not
+
+leave to-night, that so on the morrow night she may be more eager.
+
+Therefore I shall fix some things she like not--garlic and a
+
+crucifix--and so seal up the door of the tomb. She is young as Un-Dead,
+
+and will heed. Moreover, these are only to prevent her coming out; they
+
+may not prevail on her wanting to get in; for then the Un-Dead is
+
+desperate, and must find the line of least resistance, whatsoever it may
+
+be. I shall be at hand all the night from sunset till after the sunrise,
+
+and if there be aught that may be learned I shall learn it. For Miss
+
+Lucy or from her, I have no fear; but that other to whom is there that
+
+she is Un-Dead, he have now the power to seek her tomb and find shelter.
+
+He is cunning, as I know from Mr. Jonathan and from the way that all
+
+along he have fooled us when he played with us for Miss Lucy�s life, and
+
+we lost; and in many ways the Un-Dead are strong. He have always the
+
+strength in his hand of twenty men; even we four who gave our strength
+
+to Miss Lucy it also is all to him. Besides, he can summon his wolf and
+
+I know not what. So if it be that he come thither on this night he shall
+
+find me; but none other shall--until it be too late. But it may be that
+
+he will not attempt the place. There is no reason why he should; his
+
+hunting ground is more full of game than the churchyard where the
+
+Un-Dead woman sleep, and the one old man watch.
+
+�Therefore I write this in case.... Take the papers that are with this,
+
+the diaries of Harker and the rest, and read them, and then find this
+

+�VAN HELSING.�
+
+_Dr. Seward�s Diary._
+
+_28 September._--It is wonderful what a good night�s sleep will do for
+
+one. Yesterday I was almost willing to accept Van Helsing�s monstrous
+
+ideas; but now they seem to start out lurid before me as outrages on
+
+common sense. I have no doubt that he believes it all. I wonder if his
+
+mind can have become in any way unhinged. Surely there must be _some_
+
+rational explanation of all these mysterious things. Is it possible that
+
+the Professor can have done it himself? He is so abnormally clever that
+
+if he went off his head he would carry out his intent with regard to
+
+some fixed idea in a wonderful way. I am loath to think it, and indeed
+
+it would be almost as great a marvel as the other to find that Van
+
+Helsing was mad; but anyhow I shall watch him carefully. I may get some
+
+light on the mystery.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_29 September, morning._.... Last night, at a little before ten o�clock,
+
+Arthur and Quincey came into Van Helsing�s room; he told us all that he
+
+wanted us to do, but especially addressing himself to Arthur, as if all
+
+our wills were centred in his. He began by saying that he hoped we would
+
+all come with him too, �for,� he said, �there is a grave duty to be done
+
+there. You were doubtless surprised at my letter?� This query was
+
+directly addressed to Lord Godalming.
+
+�I was. It rather upset me for a bit. There has been so much trouble
+
+around my house of late that I could do without any more. I have been
+
+curious, too, as to what you mean. Quincey and I talked it over; but the
+
+more we talked, the more puzzled we got, till now I can say for myself
+
+that I�m about up a tree as to any meaning about anything.�
+
+�Me too,� said Quincey Morris laconically.
+
+�Oh,� said the Professor, �then you are nearer the beginning, both of
+
+you, than friend John here, who has to go a long way back before he can
+
+even get so far as to begin.�
+
+It was evident that he recognised my return to my old doubting frame of
+
+mind without my saying a word. Then, turning to the other two, he said
+
+with intense gravity:--
+
+�I want your permission to do what I think good this night. It is, I
+
+know, much to ask; and when you know what it is I propose to do you will
+
+know, and only then, how much. Therefore may I ask that you promise me
+
+in the dark, so that afterwards, though you may be angry with me for a
+
+time--I must not disguise from myself the possibility that such may
+
+be--you shall not blame yourselves for anything.�
+
+�That�s frank anyhow,� broke in Quincey. �I�ll answer for the Professor.
+
+I don�t quite see his drift, but I swear he�s honest; and that�s good
+
+enough for me.�
+
+�I thank you, sir,� said Van Helsing proudly. �I have done myself the
+
+honour of counting you one trusting friend, and such endorsement is dear
+
+to me.� He held out a hand, which Quincey took.
+
+Then Arthur spoke out:--
+
+�Dr. Van Helsing, I don�t quite like to �buy a pig in a poke,� as they
+
+say in Scotland, and if it be anything in which my honour as a gentleman
+
+or my faith as a Christian is concerned, I cannot make such a promise.
+
+If you can assure me that what you intend does not violate either of
+
+these two, then I give my consent at once; though for the life of me, I
+
+cannot understand what you are driving at.�
+
+�I accept your limitation,� said Van Helsing, �and all I ask of you is
+
+that if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine, you will first
+
+consider it well and be satisfied that it does not violate your
+
+reservations.�
+
+�Agreed!� said Arthur; �that is only fair. And now that the
+
+_pourparlers_ are over, may I ask what it is we are to do?�
+
+�I want you to come with me, and to come in secret, to the churchyard at
+
+Kingstead.�
+
+Arthur�s face fell as he said in an amazed sort of way:--
+
+�Where poor Lucy is buried?� The Professor bowed. Arthur went on: �And
+
+when there?�
+
+�To enter the tomb!� Arthur stood up.
+
+�Professor, are you in earnest; or it is some monstrous joke? Pardon me,
+
+I see that you are in earnest.� He sat down again, but I could see that
+
+he sat firmly and proudly, as one who is on his dignity. There was
+
+silence until he asked again:--
+
+�And when in the tomb?�
+
+�To open the coffin.�
+
+�This is too much!� he said, angrily rising again. �I am willing to be
+
+patient in all things that are reasonable; but in this--this desecration
+
+of the grave--of one who----� He fairly choked with indignation. The
+
+Professor looked pityingly at him.
+
+�If I could spare you one pang, my poor friend,� he said, �God knows I
+
+would. But this night our feet must tread in thorny paths; or later, and
+
+for ever, the feet you love must walk in paths of flame!�
+
+Arthur looked up with set white face and said:--
+
+�Take care, sir, take care!�
+
+�Would it not be well to hear what I have to say?� said Van Helsing.
+
+�And then you will at least know the limit of my purpose. Shall I go
+
+on?�
+
+�That�s fair enough,� broke in Morris.
+
+After a pause Van Helsing went on, evidently with an effort:--
+
+�Miss Lucy is dead; is it not so? Yes! Then there can be no wrong to
+
+her. But if she be not dead----�
+
+Arthur jumped to his feet.
+
+�Good God!� he cried. �What do you mean? Has there been any mistake; has
+
+she been buried alive?� He groaned in anguish that not even hope could
+
+soften.
+
+�I did not say she was alive, my child; I did not think it. I go no
+
+further than to say that she might be Un-Dead.�
+
+�Un-Dead! Not alive! What do you mean? Is this all a nightmare, or what
+
+is it?�
+
+�There are mysteries which men can only guess at, which age by age they
+
+may solve only in part. Believe me, we are now on the verge of one. But
+
+I have not done. May I cut off the head of dead Miss Lucy?�
+
+�Heavens and earth, no!� cried Arthur in a storm of passion. �Not for
+
+the wide world will I consent to any mutilation of her dead body. Dr.
+
+Van Helsing, you try me too far. What have I done to you that you should
+
+torture me so? What did that poor, sweet girl do that you should want to
+
+cast such dishonour on her grave? Are you mad to speak such things, or
+
+am I mad to listen to them? Don�t dare to think more of such a
+
+desecration; I shall not give my consent to anything you do. I have a
+
+duty to do in protecting her grave from outrage; and, by God, I shall do
+
+it!�
+
+Van Helsing rose up from where he had all the time been seated, and
+
+said, gravely and sternly:--
+
+�My Lord Godalming, I, too, have a duty to do, a duty to others, a duty
+
+to you, a duty to the dead; and, by God, I shall do it! All I ask you
+
+now is that you come with me, that you look and listen; and if when
+
+later I make the same request you do not be more eager for its
+
+fulfilment even than I am, then--then I shall do my duty, whatever it
+
+may seem to me. And then, to follow of your Lordship�s wishes I shall
+
+hold myself at your disposal to render an account to you, when and where
+
+you will.� His voice broke a little, and he went on with a voice full of
+
+pity:--
+
+�But, I beseech you, do not go forth in anger with me. In a long life of
+
+acts which were often not pleasant to do, and which sometimes did wring
+
+my heart, I have never had so heavy a task as now. Believe me that if
+
+the time comes for you to change your mind towards me, one look from
+
+you will wipe away all this so sad hour, for I would do what a man can
+
+to save you from sorrow. Just think. For why should I give myself so
+
+much of labour and so much of sorrow? I have come here from my own land
+
+to do what I can of good; at the first to please my friend John, and
+
+then to help a sweet young lady, whom, too, I came to love. For her--I
+
+am ashamed to say so much, but I say it in kindness--I gave what you
+
+gave; the blood of my veins; I gave it, I, who was not, like you, her
+
+lover, but only her physician and her friend. I gave to her my nights
+
+and days--before death, after death; and if my death can do her good
+
+even now, when she is the dead Un-Dead, she shall have it freely.� He
+
+said this with a very grave, sweet pride, and Arthur was much affected
+
+by it. He took the old man�s hand and said in a broken voice:--
+
+�Oh, it is hard to think of it, and I cannot understand; but at least I
+
+shall go with you and wait.�

+CHAPTER XXVII
+
+MINA HARKER�S JOURNAL
+
+_1 November._--All day long we have travelled, and at a good speed. The
+
+horses seem to know that they are being kindly treated, for they go
+
+willingly their full stage at best speed. We have now had so many
+
+changes and find the same thing so constantly that we are encouraged to
+
+think that the journey will be an easy one. Dr. Van Helsing is laconic;
+
+he tells the farmers that he is hurrying to Bistritz, and pays them well
+
+to make the exchange of horses. We get hot soup, or coffee, or tea; and
+
+off we go. It is a lovely country; full of beauties of all imaginable
+
+kinds, and the people are brave, and strong, and simple, and seem full
+
+of nice qualities. They are _very, very_ superstitious. In the first
+
+house where we stopped, when the woman who served us saw the scar on my
+
+forehead, she crossed herself and put out two fingers towards me, to
+
+keep off the evil eye. I believe they went to the trouble of putting an
+
+extra amount of garlic into our food; and I can�t abide garlic. Ever
+
+since then I have taken care not to take off my hat or veil, and so have
+
+escaped their suspicions. We are travelling fast, and as we have no
+
+driver with us to carry tales, we go ahead of scandal; but I daresay
+
+that fear of the evil eye will follow hard behind us all the way. The
+
+Professor seems tireless; all day he would not take any rest, though he
+
+made me sleep for a long spell. At sunset time he hypnotised me, and he
+
+says that I answered as usual �darkness, lapping water and creaking
+
+wood�; so our enemy is still on the river. I am afraid to think of
+
+Jonathan, but somehow I have now no fear for him, or for myself. I write
+
+this whilst we wait in a farmhouse for the horses to be got ready. Dr.
+
+Van Helsing is sleeping. Poor dear, he looks very tired and old and
+
+grey, but his mouth is set as firmly as a conqueror�s; even in his sleep
+
+he is instinct with resolution. When we have well started I must make
+
+him rest whilst I drive. I shall tell him that we have days before us,
+
+and we must not break down when most of all his strength will be
+
+needed.... All is ready; we are off shortly.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_2 November, morning._--I was successful, and we took turns driving all
+
+night; now the day is on us, bright though cold. There is a strange
+
+heaviness in the air--I say heaviness for want of a better word; I mean
+
+that it oppresses us both. It is very cold, and only our warm furs keep
+
+us comfortable. At dawn Van Helsing hypnotised me; he says I answered
+
+�darkness, creaking wood and roaring water,� so the river is changing as
+
+they ascend. I do hope that my darling will not run any chance of
+
+danger--more than need be; but we are in God�s hands.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_2 November, night._--All day long driving. The country gets wilder as
+
+we go, and the great spurs of the Carpathians, which at Veresti seemed
+
+so far from us and so low on the horizon, now seem to gather round us
+
+and tower in front. We both seem in good spirits; I think we make an
+
+effort each to cheer the other; in the doing so we cheer ourselves. Dr.
+
+Van Helsing says that by morning we shall reach the Borgo Pass. The
+
+houses are very few here now, and the Professor says that the last horse
+
+we got will have to go on with us, as we may not be able to change. He
+
+got two in addition to the two we changed, so that now we have a rude
+
+four-in-hand. The dear horses are patient and good, and they give us no
+
+trouble. We are not worried with other travellers, and so even I can
+
+drive. We shall get to the Pass in daylight; we do not want to arrive
+
+before. So we take it easy, and have each a long rest in turn. Oh, what
+
+will to-morrow bring to us? We go to seek the place where my poor
+
+darling suffered so much. God grant that we may be guided aright, and
+
+that He will deign to watch over my husband and those dear to us both,
+
+and who are in such deadly peril. As for me, I am not worthy in His
+
+sight. Alas! I am unclean to His eyes, and shall be until He may deign
+
+to let me stand forth in His sight as one of those who have not incurred
+
+His wrath.
+
+_Memorandum by Abraham Van Helsing._
+
+_4 November._--This to my old and true friend John Seward, M.D., of
+
+Purfleet, London, in case I may not see him. It may explain. It is
+
+morning, and I write by a fire which all the night I have kept
+
+alive--Madam Mina aiding me. It is cold, cold; so cold that the grey
+
+heavy sky is full of snow, which when it falls will settle for all
+
+winter as the ground is hardening to receive it. It seems to have
+
+affected Madam Mina; she has been so heavy of head all day that she was
+
+not like herself. She sleeps, and sleeps, and sleeps! She who is usual
+
+so alert, have done literally nothing all the day; she even have lost
+
+her appetite. She make no entry into her little diary, she who write so
+
+faithful at every pause. Something whisper to me that all is not well.
+
+However, to-night she is more _vif_. Her long sleep all day have refresh
+
+and restore her, for now she is all sweet and bright as ever. At sunset
+
+I try to hypnotise her, but alas! with no effect; the power has grown
+
+less and less with each day, and to-night it fail me altogether. Well,
+
+God�s will be done--whatever it may be, and whithersoever it may lead!
+
+Now to the historical, for as Madam Mina write not in her stenography, I
+
+must, in my cumbrous old fashion, that so each day of us may not go
+
+unrecorded.
+
+We got to the Borgo Pass just after sunrise yesterday morning. When I
+
+saw the signs of the dawn I got ready for the hypnotism. We stopped our
+
+carriage, and got down so that there might be no disturbance. I made a
+
+couch with furs, and Madam Mina, lying down, yield herself as usual, but
+
+more slow and more short time than ever, to the hypnotic sleep. As
+
+before, came the answer: �darkness and the swirling of water.� Then she
+
+woke, bright and radiant and we go on our way and soon reach the Pass.
+
+At this time and place, she become all on fire with zeal; some new
+
+guiding power be in her manifested, for she point to a road and say:--
+
+�This is the way.�
+
+�How know you it?� I ask.
+
+�Of course I know it,� she answer, and with a pause, add: �Have not my
+
+Jonathan travelled it and wrote of his travel?�
+
+At first I think somewhat strange, but soon I see that there be only one
+
+such by-road. It is used but little, and very different from the coach
+
+road from the Bukovina to Bistritz, which is more wide and hard, and
+
+more of use.
+
+So we came down this road; when we meet other ways--not always were we
+
+sure that they were roads at all, for they be neglect and light snow
+
+have fallen--the horses know and they only. I give rein to them, and
+
+they go on so patient. By-and-by we find all the things which Jonathan
+
+have note in that wonderful diary of him. Then we go on for long, long
+
+hours and hours. At the first, I tell Madam Mina to sleep; she try, and
+
+she succeed. She sleep all the time; till at the last, I feel myself to
+
+suspicious grow, and attempt to wake her. But she sleep on, and I may
+
+not wake her though I try. I do not wish to try too hard lest I harm
+
+her; for I know that she have suffer much, and sleep at times be
+
+all-in-all to her. I think I drowse myself, for all of sudden I feel
+
+guilt, as though I have done something; I find myself bolt up, with the
+
+reins in my hand, and the good horses go along jog, jog, just as ever. I
+
+look down and find Madam Mina still sleep. It is now not far off sunset
+
+time, and over the snow the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood,
+
+so that we throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so steep.
+
+For we are going up, and up; and all is oh! so wild and rocky, as though
+
+it were the end of the world.
+
+Then I arouse Madam Mina. This time she wake with not much trouble, and
+
+then I try to put her to hypnotic sleep. But she sleep not, being as
+
+though I were not. Still I try and try, till all at once I find her and
+
+myself in dark; so I look round, and find that the sun have gone down.
+
+Madam Mina laugh, and I turn and look at her. She is now quite awake,
+
+and look so well as I never saw her since that night at Carfax when we
+
+first enter the Count�s house. I am amaze, and not at ease then; but she
+
+is so bright and tender and thoughtful for me that I forget all fear. I
+
+light a fire, for we have brought supply of wood with us, and she
+
+prepare food while I undo the horses and set them, tethered in shelter,
+
+to feed. Then when I return to the fire she have my supper ready. I go
+
+to help her; but she smile, and tell me that she have eat already--that
+
+she was so hungry that she would not wait. I like it not, and I have
+
+grave doubts; but I fear to affright her, and so I am silent of it. She
+
+help me and I eat alone; and then we wrap in fur and lie beside the
+
+fire, and I tell her to sleep while I watch. But presently I forget all
+
+of watching; and when I sudden remember that I watch, I find her lying
+
+quiet, but awake, and looking at me with so bright eyes. Once, twice
+
+more the same occur, and I get much sleep till before morning. When I
+
+wake I try to hypnotise her; but alas! though she shut her eyes
+
+obedient, she may not sleep. The sun rise up, and up, and up; and then
+
+sleep come to her too late, but so heavy that she will not wake. I have
+
+to lift her up, and place her sleeping in the carriage when I have
+
+harnessed the horses and made all ready. Madam still sleep, and she look
+
+in her sleep more healthy and more redder than before. And I like it
+
+not. And I am afraid, afraid, afraid!--I am afraid of all things--even
+
+to think but I must go on my way. The stake we play for is life and
+
+death, or more than these, and we must not flinch.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_5 November, morning._--Let me be accurate in everything, for though you
+
+and I have seen some strange things together, you may at the first think
+
+that I, Van Helsing, am mad--that the many horrors and the so long
+
+strain on nerves has at the last turn my brain.
+
+All yesterday we travel, ever getting closer to the mountains, and
+
+moving into a more and more wild and desert land. There are great,
+
+frowning precipices and much falling water, and Nature seem to have held
+
+sometime her carnival. Madam Mina still sleep and sleep; and though I
+
+did have hunger and appeased it, I could not waken her--even for food. I
+
+began to fear that the fatal spell of the place was upon her, tainted as
+
+she is with that Vampire baptism. �Well,� said I to myself, �if it be
+
+that she sleep all the day, it shall also be that I do not sleep at
+
+night.� As we travel on the rough road, for a road of an ancient and
+
+imperfect kind there was, I held down my head and slept. Again I waked
+
+with a sense of guilt and of time passed, and found Madam Mina still
+
+sleeping, and the sun low down. But all was indeed changed; the frowning
+
+mountains seemed further away, and we were near the top of a
+
+steep-rising hill, on summit of which was such a castle as Jonathan tell
+
+of in his diary. At once I exulted and feared; for now, for good or ill,
+
+the end was near.
+
+I woke Madam Mina, and again tried to hypnotise her; but alas!
+
+unavailing till too late. Then, ere the great dark came upon us--for
+
+even after down-sun the heavens reflected the gone sun on the snow, and
+
+all was for a time in a great twilight--I took out the horses and fed
+
+them in what shelter I could. Then I make a fire; and near it I make
+
+Madam Mina, now awake and more charming than ever, sit comfortable amid
+
+her rugs. I got ready food: but she would not eat, simply saying that
+
+she had not hunger. I did not press her, knowing her unavailingness. But
+
+I myself eat, for I must needs now be strong for all. Then, with the
+
+fear on me of what might be, I drew a ring so big for her comfort, round
+
+where Madam Mina sat; and over the ring I passed some of the wafer, and
+
+I broke it fine so that all was well guarded. She sat still all the
+
+time--so still as one dead; and she grew whiter and ever whiter till the
+
+snow was not more pale; and no word she said. But when I drew near, she
+
+clung to me, and I could know that the poor soul shook her from head to
+
+feet with a tremor that was pain to feel. I said to her presently, when
+
+she had grown more quiet:--
+
+�Will you not come over to the fire?� for I wished to make a test of
+
+what she could. She rose obedient, but when she have made a step she
+
+stopped, and stood as one stricken.
+
+�Why not go on?� I asked. She shook her head, and, coming back, sat
+
+down in her place. Then, looking at me with open eyes, as of one waked
+
+from sleep, she said simply:--
+
+�I cannot!� and remained silent. I rejoiced, for I knew that what she
+
+could not, none of those that we dreaded could. Though there might be
+
+danger to her body, yet her soul was safe!
+
+Presently the horses began to scream, and tore at their tethers till I
+
+came to them and quieted them. When they did feel my hands on them, they
+
+whinnied low as in joy, and licked at my hands and were quiet for a
+
+time. Many times through the night did I come to them, till it arrive to
+
+the cold hour when all nature is at lowest; and every time my coming was
+
+with quiet of them. In the cold hour the fire began to die, and I was
+
+about stepping forth to replenish it, for now the snow came in flying
+
+sweeps and with it a chill mist. Even in the dark there was a light of
+
+some kind, as there ever is over snow; and it seemed as though the
+
+snow-flurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of women with
+
+trailing garments. All was in dead, grim silence only that the horses
+
+whinnied and cowered, as if in terror of the worst. I began to
+
+fear--horrible fears; but then came to me the sense of safety in that
+
+ring wherein I stood. I began, too, to think that my imaginings were of
+
+the night, and the gloom, and the unrest that I have gone through, and
+
+all the terrible anxiety. It was as though my memories of all Jonathan�s
+
+horrid experience were befooling me; for the snow flakes and the mist
+
+began to wheel and circle round, till I could get as though a shadowy
+
+glimpse of those women that would have kissed him. And then the horses
+
+cowered lower and lower, and moaned in terror as men do in pain. Even
+
+the madness of fright was not to them, so that they could break away. I
+
+feared for my dear Madam Mina when these weird figures drew near and
+
+circled round. I looked at her, but she sat calm, and smiled at me; when
+
+I would have stepped to the fire to replenish it, she caught me and held
+
+me back, and whispered, like a voice that one hears in a dream, so low
+
+it was:--
+
+�No! No! Do not go without. Here you are safe!� I turned to her, and
+
+looking in her eyes, said:--
+
+�But you? It is for you that I fear!� whereat she laughed--a laugh, low
+
+and unreal, and said:--
+
+�Fear for _me_! Why fear for me? None safer in all the world from them
+
+than I am,� and as I wondered at the meaning of her words, a puff of
+
+wind made the flame leap up, and I see the red scar on her forehead.
+
+Then, alas! I knew. Did I not, I would soon have learned, for the
+
+wheeling figures of mist and snow came closer, but keeping ever without
+
+the Holy circle. Then they began to materialise till--if God have not
+
+take away my reason, for I saw it through my eyes--there were before me
+
+in actual flesh the same three women that Jonathan saw in the room, when
+
+they would have kissed his throat. I knew the swaying round forms, the
+
+bright hard eyes, the white teeth, the ruddy colour, the voluptuous
+
+lips. They smiled ever at poor dear Madam Mina; and as their laugh came
+
+through the silence of the night, they twined their arms and pointed to
+
+her, and said in those so sweet tingling tones that Jonathan said were
+
+of the intolerable sweetness of the water-glasses:--
+
+�Come, sister. Come to us. Come! Come!� In fear I turned to my poor
+
+Madam Mina, and my heart with gladness leapt like flame; for oh! the
+
+terror in her sweet eyes, the repulsion, the horror, told a story to my
+
+heart that was all of hope. God be thanked she was not, yet, of them. I
+
+seized some of the firewood which was by me, and holding out some of the
+
+Wafer, advanced on them towards the fire. They drew back before me, and
+
+laughed their low horrid laugh. I fed the fire, and feared them not; for
+
+I knew that we were safe within our protections. They could not
+
+approach, me, whilst so armed, nor Madam Mina whilst she remained within
+
+the ring, which she could not leave no more than they could enter. The
+
+horses had ceased to moan, and lay still on the ground; the snow fell on
+
+them softly, and they grew whiter. I knew that there was for the poor
+
+beasts no more of terror.
+
+And so we remained till the red of the dawn to fall through the
+
+snow-gloom. I was desolate and afraid, and full of woe and terror; but
+
+when that beautiful sun began to climb the horizon life was to me again.
+
+At the first coming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in the
+
+whirling mist and snow; the wreaths of transparent gloom moved away
+
+towards the castle, and were lost.
+
+Instinctively, with the dawn coming, I turned to Madam Mina, intending
+
+to hypnotise her; but she lay in a deep and sudden sleep, from which I
+
+could not wake her. I tried to hypnotise through her sleep, but she made
+
+no response, none at all; and the day broke. I fear yet to stir. I have
+
+made my fire and have seen the horses, they are all dead. To-day I have
+
+much to do here, and I keep waiting till the sun is up high; for there
+
+may be places where I must go, where that sunlight, though snow and mist
+
+obscure it, will be to me a safety.
+
+I will strengthen me with breakfast, and then I will to my terrible
+
+work. Madam Mina still sleeps; and, God be thanked! she is calm in her
+
+sleep....
+
+_Jonathan Harker�s Journal._
+
+_4 November, evening._--The accident to the launch has been a terrible
+
+thing for us. Only for it we should have overtaken the boat long ago;
+
+and by now my dear Mina would have been free. I fear to think of her,
+
+off on the wolds near that horrid place. We have got horses, and we
+
+follow on the track. I note this whilst Godalming is getting ready. We
+
+have our arms. The Szgany must look out if they mean fight. Oh, if only
+
+Morris and Seward were with us. We must only hope! If I write no more
+
+Good-bye, Mina! God bless and keep you.
+
+_Dr. Seward�s Diary._
+
+_5 November._--With the dawn we saw the body of Szgany before us dashing
+
+away from the river with their leiter-wagon. They surrounded it in a
+
+cluster, and hurried along as though beset. The snow is falling lightly
+
+and there is a strange excitement in the air. It may be our own
+
+feelings, but the depression is strange. Far off I hear the howling of
+
+wolves; the snow brings them down from the mountains, and there are
+
+dangers to all of us, and from all sides. The horses are nearly ready,
+
+and we are soon off. We ride to death of some one. God alone knows who,
+
+or where, or what, or when, or how it may be....
+
+_Dr. Van Helsing�s Memorandum._
+
+_5 November, afternoon._--I am at least sane. Thank God for that mercy
+
+at all events, though the proving it has been dreadful. When I left
+
+Madam Mina sleeping within the Holy circle, I took my way to the castle.
+
+The blacksmith hammer which I took in the carriage from Veresti was
+
+useful; though the doors were all open I broke them off the rusty
+
+hinges, lest some ill-intent or ill-chance should close them, so that
+
+being entered I might not get out. Jonathan�s bitter experience served
+
+me here. By memory of his diary I found my way to the old chapel, for I
+
+knew that here my work lay. The air was oppressive; it seemed as if
+
+there was some sulphurous fume, which at times made me dizzy. Either
+
+there was a roaring in my ears or I heard afar off the howl of wolves.
+
+Then I bethought me of my dear Madam Mina, and I was in terrible plight.
+
+The dilemma had me between his horns.
+
+Her, I had not dare to take into this place, but left safe from the
+
+Vampire in that Holy circle; and yet even there would be the wolf! I
+
+resolve me that my work lay here, and that as to the wolves we must
+
+submit, if it were God�s will. At any rate it was only death and
+
+freedom beyond. So did I choose for her. Had it but been for myself the
+
+choice had been easy, the maw of the wolf were better to rest in than
+
+the grave of the Vampire! So I make my choice to go on with my work.
+
+I knew that there were at least three graves to find--graves that are
+
+inhabit; so I search, and search, and I find one of them. She lay in her
+
+Vampire sleep, so full of life and voluptuous beauty that I shudder as
+
+though I have come to do murder. Ah, I doubt not that in old time, when
+
+such things were, many a man who set forth to do such a task as mine,
+
+found at the last his heart fail him, and then his nerve. So he delay,
+
+and delay, and delay, till the mere beauty and the fascination of the
+
+wanton Un-Dead have hypnotise him; and he remain on and on, till sunset
+
+come, and the Vampire sleep be over. Then the beautiful eyes of the fair
+
+woman open and look love, and the voluptuous mouth present to a
+
+kiss--and man is weak. And there remain one more victim in the Vampire
+
+fold; one more to swell the grim and grisly ranks of the Un-Dead!...
+
+There is some fascination, surely, when I am moved by the mere presence
+
+of such an one, even lying as she lay in a tomb fretted with age and
+
+heavy with the dust of centuries, though there be that horrid odour such
+
+as the lairs of the Count have had. Yes, I was moved--I, Van Helsing,
+
+with all my purpose and with my motive for hate--I was moved to a
+
+yearning for delay which seemed to paralyse my faculties and to clog my
+
+very soul. It may have been that the need of natural sleep, and the
+
+strange oppression of the air were beginning to overcome me. Certain it
+
+was that I was lapsing into sleep, the open-eyed sleep of one who yields
+
+to a sweet fascination, when there came through the snow-stilled air a
+
+long, low wail, so full of woe and pity that it woke me like the sound
+
+of a clarion. For it was the voice of my dear Madam Mina that I heard.
+
+Then I braced myself again to my horrid task, and found by wrenching
+
+away tomb-tops one other of the sisters, the other dark one. I dared not
+
+pause to look on her as I had on her sister, lest once more I should
+
+begin to be enthrall; but I go on searching until, presently, I find in
+
+a high great tomb as if made to one much beloved that other fair sister
+
+which, like Jonathan I had seen to gather herself out of the atoms of
+
+the mist. She was so fair to look on, so radiantly beautiful, so
+
+exquisitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in me, which calls
+
+some of my sex to love and to protect one of hers, made my head whirl
+
+with new emotion. But God be thanked, that soul-wail of my dear Madam
+
+Mina had not died out of my ears; and, before the spell could be wrought
+
+further upon me, I had nerved myself to my wild work. By this time I had
+
+searched all the tombs in the chapel, so far as I could tell; and as
+
+there had been only three of these Un-Dead phantoms around us in the
+
+night, I took it that there were no more of active Un-Dead existent.
+
+There was one great tomb more lordly than all the rest; huge it was, and
+
+nobly proportioned. On it was but one word
+
+DRACULA.
+
+This then was the Un-Dead home of the King-Vampire, to whom so many more
+
+were due. Its emptiness spoke eloquent to make certain what I knew.
+
+Before I began to restore these women to their dead selves through my
+
+awful work, I laid in Dracula�s tomb some of the Wafer, and so banished
+
+him from it, Un-Dead, for ever.
+
+Then began my terrible task, and I dreaded it. Had it been but one, it
+
+had been easy, comparative. But three! To begin twice more after I had
+
+been through a deed of horror; for if it was terrible with the sweet
+
+Miss Lucy, what would it not be with these strange ones who had survived
+
+through centuries, and who had been strengthened by the passing of the
+
+years; who would, if they could, have fought for their foul lives....
+
+Oh, my friend John, but it was butcher work; had I not been nerved by
+
+thoughts of other dead, and of the living over whom hung such a pall of
+
+fear, I could not have gone on. I tremble and tremble even yet, though
+
+till all was over, God be thanked, my nerve did stand. Had I not seen
+
+the repose in the first place, and the gladness that stole over it just
+
+ere the final dissolution came, as realisation that the soul had been
+
+won, I could not have gone further with my butchery. I could not have
+
+endured the horrid screeching as the stake drove home; the plunging of
+
+writhing form, and lips of bloody foam. I should have fled in terror and
+
+left my work undone. But it is over! And the poor souls, I can pity them
+
+now and weep, as I think of them placid each in her full sleep of death
+
+for a short moment ere fading. For, friend John, hardly had my knife
+
+severed the head of each, before the whole body began to melt away and
+
+crumble in to its native dust, as though the death that should have come
+
+centuries agone had at last assert himself and say at once and loud �I
+
+am here!�
+
+Before I left the castle I so fixed its entrances that never more can
+
+the Count enter there Un-Dead.
+
+When I stepped into the circle where Madam Mina slept, she woke from her
+
+sleep, and, seeing, me, cried out in pain that I had endured too much.
+
+�Come!� she said, �come away from this awful place! Let us go to meet my
+
+husband who is, I know, coming towards us.� She was looking thin and
+
+pale and weak; but her eyes were pure and glowed with fervour. I was
+
+glad to see her paleness and her illness, for my mind was full of the
+
+fresh horror of that ruddy vampire sleep.
+
+And so with trust and hope, and yet full of fear, we go eastward to meet
+
+our friends--and _him_--whom Madam Mina tell me that she _know_ are
+
+coming to meet us.
+
+_Mina Harker�s Journal._
+
+_6 November._--It was late in the afternoon when the Professor and I
+
+took our way towards the east whence I knew Jonathan was coming. We did
+
+not go fast, though the way was steeply downhill, for we had to take
+
+heavy rugs and wraps with us; we dared not face the possibility of being
+
+left without warmth in the cold and the snow. We had to take some of our
+
+provisions, too, for we were in a perfect desolation, and, so far as we
+
+could see through the snowfall, there was not even the sign of
+
+habitation. When we had gone about a mile, I was tired with the heavy
+
+walking and sat down to rest. Then we looked back and saw where the
+
+clear line of Dracula�s castle cut the sky; for we were so deep under
+
+the hill whereon it was set that the angle of perspective of the
+
+Carpathian mountains was far below it. We saw it in all its grandeur,
+
+perched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipice, and with
+
+seemingly a great gap between it and the steep of the adjacent mountain
+
+on any side. There was something wild and uncanny about the place. We
+
+could hear the distant howling of wolves. They were far off, but the
+
+sound, even though coming muffled through the deadening snowfall, was
+
+full of terror. I knew from the way Dr. Van Helsing was searching about
+
+that he was trying to seek some strategic point, where we would be less
+
+exposed in case of attack. The rough roadway still led downwards; we
+
+could trace it through the drifted snow.
+
+In a little while the Professor signalled to me, so I got up and joined
+
+him. He had found a wonderful spot, a sort of natural hollow in a rock,
+
+with an entrance like a doorway between two boulders. He took me by the
+
+hand and drew me in: �See!� he said, �here you will be in shelter; and
+
+if the wolves do come I can meet them one by one.� He brought in our
+
+furs, and made a snug nest for me, and got out some provisions and
+
+forced them upon me. But I could not eat; to even try to do so was
+
+repulsive to me, and, much as I would have liked to please him, I could
+
+not bring myself to the attempt. He looked very sad, but did not
+
+reproach me. Taking his field-glasses from the case, he stood on the top
+
+of the rock, and began to search the horizon. Suddenly he called out:--
+
+�Look! Madam Mina, look! look!� I sprang up and stood beside him on the
+
+rock; he handed me his glasses and pointed. The snow was now falling
+
+more heavily, and swirled about fiercely, for a high wind was beginning
+
+to blow. However, there were times when there were pauses between the
+
+snow flurries and I could see a long way round. From the height where we
+
+were it was possible to see a great distance; and far off, beyond the
+
+white waste of snow, I could see the river lying like a black ribbon in
+
+kinks and curls as it wound its way. Straight in front of us and not far
+
+off--in fact, so near that I wondered we had not noticed before--came a
+
+group of mounted men hurrying along. In the midst of them was a cart, a
+
+long leiter-wagon which swept from side to side, like a dog�s tail
+
+wagging, with each stern inequality of the road. Outlined against the
+
+snow as they were, I could see from the men�s clothes that they were
+
+peasants or gypsies of some kind.
+
+On the cart was a great square chest. My heart leaped as I saw it, for I
+
+felt that the end was coming. The evening was now drawing close, and
+
+well I knew that at sunset the Thing, which was till then imprisoned
+
+there, would take new freedom and could in any of many forms elude all
+
+pursuit. In fear I turned to the Professor; to my consternation,
+
+however, he was not there. An instant later, I saw him below me. Round
+
+the rock he had drawn a circle, such as we had found shelter in last
+
+night. When he had completed it he stood beside me again, saying:--
+
+�At least you shall be safe here from _him_!� He took the glasses from
+
+me, and at the next lull of the snow swept the whole space below us.
+
+�See,� he said, �they come quickly; they are flogging the horses, and
+
+galloping as hard as they can.� He paused and went on in a hollow
+
+voice:--
+
+�They are racing for the sunset. We may be too late. God�s will be
+
+done!� Down came another blinding rush of driving snow, and the whole
+
+landscape was blotted out. It soon passed, however, and once more his
+
+glasses were fixed on the plain. Then came a sudden cry:--
+
+�Look! Look! Look! See, two horsemen follow fast, coming up from the
+
+south. It must be Quincey and John. Take the glass. Look before the snow
+
+blots it all out!� I took it and looked. The two men might be Dr. Seward
+
+and Mr. Morris. I knew at all events that neither of them was Jonathan.
+
+At the same time I _knew_ that Jonathan was not far off; looking around
+
+I saw on the north side of the coming party two other men, riding at
+
+break-neck speed. One of them I knew was Jonathan, and the other I took,
+
+of course, to be Lord Godalming. They, too, were pursuing the party with
+
+the cart. When I told the Professor he shouted in glee like a schoolboy,
+
+and, after looking intently till a snow fall made sight impossible, he
+
+laid his Winchester rifle ready for use against the boulder at the
+
+opening of our shelter. �They are all converging,� he said. �When the
+
+time comes we shall have gypsies on all sides.� I got out my revolver
+
+ready to hand, for whilst we were speaking the howling of wolves came
+
+louder and closer. When the snow storm abated a moment we looked again.
+
+It was strange to see the snow falling in such heavy flakes close to us,
+
+and beyond, the sun shining more and more brightly as it sank down
+
+towards the far mountain tops. Sweeping the glass all around us I could
+
+see here and there dots moving singly and in twos and threes and larger
+
+numbers--the wolves were gathering for their prey.
+
+Every instant seemed an age whilst we waited. The wind came now in
+
+fierce bursts, and the snow was driven with fury as it swept upon us in
+
+circling eddies. At times we could not see an arm�s length before us;
+
+but at others, as the hollow-sounding wind swept by us, it seemed to
+
+clear the air-space around us so that we could see afar off. We had of
+
+late been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset, that we knew
+
+with fair accuracy when it would be; and we knew that before long the
+
+sun would set. It was hard to believe that by our watches it was less
+
+than an hour that we waited in that rocky shelter before the various
+
+bodies began to converge close upon us. The wind came now with fiercer
+
+and more bitter sweeps, and more steadily from the north. It seemingly
+
+had driven the snow clouds from us, for, with only occasional bursts,
+
+the snow fell. We could distinguish clearly the individuals of each
+
+party, the pursued and the pursuers. Strangely enough those pursued did
+
+not seem to realise, or at least to care, that they were pursued; they
+
+seemed, however, to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lower
+
+and lower on the mountain tops.
+
+Closer and closer they drew. The Professor and I crouched down behind
+
+our rock, and held our weapons ready; I could see that he was determined
+
+that they should not pass. One and all were quite unaware of our
+
+presence.
+
+All at once two voices shouted out to: �Halt!� One was my Jonathan�s,
+
+raised in a high key of passion; the other Mr. Morris� strong resolute
+
+tone of quiet command. The gypsies may not have known the language, but
+
+there was no mistaking the tone, in whatever tongue the words were
+
+spoken. Instinctively they reined in, and at the instant Lord Godalming
+
+and Jonathan dashed up at one side and Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris on the
+
+other. The leader of the gypsies, a splendid-looking fellow who sat his
+
+horse like a centaur, waved them back, and in a fierce voice gave to his
+
+companions some word to proceed. They lashed the horses which sprang
+
+forward; but the four men raised their Winchester rifles, and in an
+
+unmistakable way commanded them to stop. At the same moment Dr. Van
+
+Helsing and I rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them.
+
+Seeing that they were surrounded the men tightened their reins and drew
+
+up. The leader turned to them and gave a word at which every man of the
+
+gypsy party drew what weapon he carried, knife or pistol, and held
+
+himself in readiness to attack. Issue was joined in an instant.
+
+The leader, with a quick movement of his rein, threw his horse out in
+
+front, and pointing first to the sun--now close down on the hill
+
+tops--and then to the castle, said something which I did not understand.
+
+For answer, all four men of our party threw themselves from their horses
+
+and dashed towards the cart. I should have felt terrible fear at seeing
+
+Jonathan in such danger, but that the ardour of battle must have been
+
+upon me as well as the rest of them; I felt no fear, but only a wild,
+
+surging desire to do something. Seeing the quick movement of our
+
+parties, the leader of the gypsies gave a command; his men instantly
+
+formed round the cart in a sort of undisciplined endeavour, each one
+
+shouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carry out the
+
+order.
+
+In the midst of this I could see that Jonathan on one side of the ring
+
+of men, and Quincey on the other, were forcing a way to the cart; it was
+
+evident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sun
+
+should set. Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them. Neither the
+
+levelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front, nor
+
+the howling of the wolves behind, appeared to even attract their
+
+attention. Jonathan�s impetuosity, and the manifest singleness of his
+
+purpose, seemed to overawe those in front of him; instinctively they
+
+cowered, aside and let him pass. In an instant he had jumped upon the
+
+cart, and, with a strength which seemed incredible, raised the great
+
+box, and flung it over the wheel to the ground. In the meantime, Mr.
+
+Morris had had to use force to pass through his side of the ring of
+
+Szgany. All the time I had been breathlessly watching Jonathan I had,
+
+with the tail of my eye, seen him pressing desperately forward, and had
+
+seen the knives of the gypsies flash as he won a way through them, and
+
+they cut at him. He had parried with his great bowie knife, and at first
+
+I thought that he too had come through in safety; but as he sprang
+
+beside Jonathan, who had by now jumped from the cart, I could see that
+
+with his left hand he was clutching at his side, and that the blood was
+
+spurting through his fingers. He did not delay notwithstanding this, for
+
+as Jonathan, with desperate energy, attacked one end of the chest,
+
+attempting to prize off the lid with his great Kukri knife, he attacked
+
+the other frantically with his bowie. Under the efforts of both men the
+
+lid began to yield; the nails drew with a quick screeching sound, and
+
+the top of the box was thrown back.
+
+By this time the gypsies, seeing themselves covered by the Winchesters,
+
+and at the mercy of Lord Godalming and Dr. Seward, had given in and made
+
+no resistance. The sun was almost down on the mountain tops, and the
+
+shadows of the whole group fell long upon the snow. I saw the Count
+
+lying within the box upon the earth, some of which the rude falling from
+
+the cart had scattered over him. He was deathly pale, just like a waxen
+
+image, and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which I
+
+knew too well.
+
+As I looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in them
+
+turned to triumph.
+
+But, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of Jonathan�s great knife.
+
+I shrieked as I saw it shear through the throat; whilst at the same
+
+moment Mr. Morris�s bowie knife plunged into the heart.
+
+It was like a miracle; but before our very eyes, and almost in the
+
+drawing of a breath, the whole body crumbled into dust and passed from
+
+our sight.
+
+I shall be glad as long as I live that even in that moment of final
+
+dissolution, there was in the face a look of peace, such as I never
+
+could have imagined might have rested there.
+
+The Castle of Dracula now stood out against the red sky, and every stone
+
+of its broken battlements was articulated against the light of the
+
+setting sun.
+
+The gypsies, taking us as in some way the cause of the extraordinary
+
+disappearance of the dead man, turned, without a word, and rode away as
+
+if for their lives. Those who were unmounted jumped upon the
+
+leiter-wagon and shouted to the horsemen not to desert them. The wolves,
+
+which had withdrawn to a safe distance, followed in their wake, leaving
+
+us alone.
+
+Mr. Morris, who had sunk to the ground, leaned on his elbow, holding his
+
+hand pressed to his side; the blood still gushed through his fingers. I
+
+flew to him, for the Holy circle did not now keep me back; so did the
+
+two doctors. Jonathan knelt behind him and the wounded man laid back his
+
+head on his shoulder. With a sigh he took, with a feeble effort, my hand
+
+in that of his own which was unstained. He must have seen the anguish of
+
+my heart in my face, for he smiled at me and said:--
+
+�I am only too happy to have been of any service! Oh, God!� he cried
+
+suddenly, struggling up to a sitting posture and pointing to me, �It was
+
+worth for this to die! Look! look!�
+
+The sun was now right down upon the mountain top, and the red gleams
+
+fell upon my face, so that it was bathed in rosy light. With one impulse
+
+the men sank on their knees and a deep and earnest �Amen� broke from all
+
+as their eyes followed the pointing of his finger. The dying man
+
+spoke:--
+
+�Now God be thanked that all has not been in vain! See! the snow is not
+
+more stainless than her forehead! The curse has passed away!�
+
+And, to our bitter grief, with a smile and in silence, he died, a
+
+gallant gentleman.
+
+NOTE
+
+Seven years ago we all went through the flames; and the happiness of
+
+some of us since then is, we think, well worth the pain we endured. It
+
+is an added joy to Mina and to me that our boy�s birthday is the same
+
+day as that on which Quincey Morris died. His mother holds, I know, the
+
+secret belief that some of our brave friend�s spirit has passed into
+
+him. His bundle of names links all our little band of men together; but
+
+we call him Quincey.
+
+In the summer of this year we made a journey to Transylvania, and went
+
+over the old ground which was, and is, to us so full of vivid and
+
+terrible memories. It was almost impossible to believe that the things
+
+which we had seen with our own eyes and heard with our own ears were
+
+living truths. Every trace of all that had been was blotted out. The
+
+castle stood as before, reared high above a waste of desolation.
+
+When we got home we were talking of the old time--which we could all
+
+look back on without despair, for Godalming and Seward are both happily
+
+married. I took the papers from the safe where they had been ever since
+
+our return so long ago. We were struck with the fact, that in all the
+
+mass of material of which the record is composed, there is hardly one
+

+CHAPTER VIII
+
+MINA MURRAY�S JOURNAL
+
+_Same day, 11 o�clock p. m._--Oh, but I am tired! If it were not that I
+
+had made my diary a duty I should not open it to-night. We had a lovely
+
+walk. Lucy, after a while, was in gay spirits, owing, I think, to some
+
+dear cows who came nosing towards us in a field close to the lighthouse,
+
+and frightened the wits out of us. I believe we forgot everything
+
+except, of course, personal fear, and it seemed to wipe the slate clean
+
+and give us a fresh start. We had a capital �severe tea� at Robin Hood�s
+
+Bay in a sweet little old-fashioned inn, with a bow-window right over
+
+the seaweed-covered rocks of the strand. I believe we should have
+
+shocked the �New Woman� with our appetites. Men are more tolerant, bless
+
+them! Then we walked home with some, or rather many, stoppages to rest,
+
+and with our hearts full of a constant dread of wild bulls. Lucy was
+
+really tired, and we intended to creep off to bed as soon as we could.
+
+The young curate came in, however, and Mrs. Westenra asked him to stay
+
+for supper. Lucy and I had both a fight for it with the dusty miller; I
+
+know it was a hard fight on my part, and I am quite heroic. I think that
+
+some day the bishops must get together and see about breeding up a new
+
+class of curates, who don�t take supper, no matter how they may be
+
+pressed to, and who will know when girls are tired. Lucy is asleep and
+
+breathing softly. She has more colour in her cheeks than usual, and
+
+looks, oh, so sweet. If Mr. Holmwood fell in love with her seeing her
+
+only in the drawing-room, I wonder what he would say if he saw her now.
+
+Some of the �New Women� writers will some day start an idea that men and
+
+women should be allowed to see each other asleep before proposing or
+
+accepting. But I suppose the New Woman won�t condescend in future to
+
+accept; she will do the proposing herself. And a nice job she will make
+
+of it, too! There�s some consolation in that. I am so happy to-night,
+
+because dear Lucy seems better. I really believe she has turned the
+
+corner, and that we are over her troubles with dreaming. I should be
+
+quite happy if I only knew if Jonathan.... God bless and keep him.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_11 August, 3 a. m._--Diary again. No sleep now, so I may as well write.
+
+I am too agitated to sleep. We have had such an adventure, such an
+
+agonising experience. I fell asleep as soon as I had closed my diary....
+
+Suddenly I became broad awake, and sat up, with a horrible sense of fear
+
+upon me, and of some feeling of emptiness around me. The room was dark,
+
+so I could not see Lucy�s bed; I stole across and felt for her. The bed
+
+was empty. I lit a match and found that she was not in the room. The
+
+door was shut, but not locked, as I had left it. I feared to wake her
+
+mother, who has been more than usually ill lately, so threw on some
+
+clothes and got ready to look for her. As I was leaving the room it
+
+struck me that the clothes she wore might give me some clue to her
+
+dreaming intention. Dressing-gown would mean house; dress, outside.
+
+Dressing-gown and dress were both in their places. �Thank God,� I said
+
+to myself, �she cannot be far, as she is only in her nightdress.� I ran
+
+downstairs and looked in the sitting-room. Not there! Then I looked in
+
+all the other open rooms of the house, with an ever-growing fear
+
+chilling my heart. Finally I came to the hall door and found it open. It
+
+was not wide open, but the catch of the lock had not caught. The people
+
+of the house are careful to lock the door every night, so I feared that
+
+Lucy must have gone out as she was. There was no time to think of what
+
+might happen; a vague, overmastering fear obscured all details. I took a
+
+big, heavy shawl and ran out. The clock was striking one as I was in the
+
+Crescent, and there was not a soul in sight. I ran along the North
+
+Terrace, but could see no sign of the white figure which I expected. At
+
+the edge of the West Cliff above the pier I looked across the harbour to
+
+the East Cliff, in the hope or fear--I don�t know which--of seeing Lucy
+
+in our favourite seat. There was a bright full moon, with heavy black,
+
+driving clouds, which threw the whole scene into a fleeting diorama of
+
+light and shade as they sailed across. For a moment or two I could see
+
+nothing, as the shadow of a cloud obscured St. Mary�s Church and all
+
+around it. Then as the cloud passed I could see the ruins of the abbey
+
+coming into view; and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp as
+
+a sword-cut moved along, the church and the churchyard became gradually
+
+visible. Whatever my expectation was, it was not disappointed, for
+
+there, on our favourite seat, the silver light of the moon struck a
+
+half-reclining figure, snowy white. The coming of the cloud was too
+
+quick for me to see much, for shadow shut down on light almost
+
+immediately; but it seemed to me as though something dark stood behind
+
+the seat where the white figure shone, and bent over it. What it was,
+
+whether man or beast, I could not tell; I did not wait to catch another
+
+glance, but flew down the steep steps to the pier and along by the
+
+fish-market to the bridge, which was the only way to reach the East
+
+Cliff. The town seemed as dead, for not a soul did I see; I rejoiced
+
+that it was so, for I wanted no witness of poor Lucy�s condition. The
+
+time and distance seemed endless, and my knees trembled and my breath
+
+came laboured as I toiled up the endless steps to the abbey. I must have
+
+gone fast, and yet it seemed to me as if my feet were weighted with
+
+lead, and as though every joint in my body were rusty. When I got almost
+
+to the top I could see the seat and the white figure, for I was now
+
+close enough to distinguish it even through the spells of shadow. There
+
+was undoubtedly something, long and black, bending over the
+
+half-reclining white figure. I called in fright, �Lucy! Lucy!� and
+
+something raised a head, and from where I was I could see a white face
+
+and red, gleaming eyes. Lucy did not answer, and I ran on to the
+
+entrance of the churchyard. As I entered, the church was between me and
+
+the seat, and for a minute or so I lost sight of her. When I came in
+
+view again the cloud had passed, and the moonlight struck so brilliantly
+
+that I could see Lucy half reclining with her head lying over the back
+
+of the seat. She was quite alone, and there was not a sign of any living
+
+thing about.
+
+When I bent over her I could see that she was still asleep. Her lips
+
+were parted, and she was breathing--not softly as usual with her, but in
+
+long, heavy gasps, as though striving to get her lungs full at every
+
+breath. As I came close, she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled the
+
+collar of her nightdress close around her throat. Whilst she did so
+
+there came a little shudder through her, as though she felt the cold. I
+
+flung the warm shawl over her, and drew the edges tight round her neck,
+
+for I dreaded lest she should get some deadly chill from the night air,
+
+unclad as she was. I feared to wake her all at once, so, in order to
+
+have my hands free that I might help her, I fastened the shawl at her
+
+throat with a big safety-pin; but I must have been clumsy in my anxiety
+
+and pinched or pricked her with it, for by-and-by, when her breathing
+
+became quieter, she put her hand to her throat again and moaned. When I
+
+had her carefully wrapped up I put my shoes on her feet and then began
+
+very gently to wake her. At first she did not respond; but gradually she
+
+became more and more uneasy in her sleep, moaning and sighing
+
+occasionally. At last, as time was passing fast, and, for many other
+
+reasons, I wished to get her home at once, I shook her more forcibly,
+
+till finally she opened her eyes and awoke. She did not seem surprised
+
+to see me, as, of course, she did not realise all at once where she was.
+
+Lucy always wakes prettily, and even at such a time, when her body must
+
+have been chilled with cold, and her mind somewhat appalled at waking
+
+unclad in a churchyard at night, she did not lose her grace. She
+
+trembled a little, and clung to me; when I told her to come at once with
+
+me home she rose without a word, with the obedience of a child. As we
+
+passed along, the gravel hurt my feet, and Lucy noticed me wince. She
+
+stopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes; but I would not.
+
+However, when we got to the pathway outside the churchyard, where there
+
+was a puddle of water, remaining from the storm, I daubed my feet with
+
+mud, using each foot in turn on the other, so that as we went home, no
+
+one, in case we should meet any one, should notice my bare feet.
+
+Fortune favoured us, and we got home without meeting a soul. Once we saw
+
+a man, who seemed not quite sober, passing along a street in front of
+
+us; but we hid in a door till he had disappeared up an opening such as
+
+there are here, steep little closes, or �wynds,� as they call them in
+
+Scotland. My heart beat so loud all the time that sometimes I thought I
+
+should faint. I was filled with anxiety about Lucy, not only for her
+
+health, lest she should suffer from the exposure, but for her reputation
+
+in case the story should get wind. When we got in, and had washed our
+
+feet, and had said a prayer of thankfulness together, I tucked her into
+
+bed. Before falling asleep she asked--even implored--me not to say a
+
+word to any one, even her mother, about her sleep-walking adventure. I
+
+hesitated at first to promise; but on thinking of the state of her
+
+mother�s health, and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret her,
+
+and thinking, too, of how such a story might become distorted--nay,
+
+infallibly would--in case it should leak out, I thought it wiser to do
+
+so. I hope I did right. I have locked the door, and the key is tied to
+
+my wrist, so perhaps I shall not be again disturbed. Lucy is sleeping
+
+soundly; the reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea....
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_Same day, noon._--All goes well. Lucy slept till I woke her and seemed
+
+not to have even changed her side. The adventure of the night does not
+
+seem to have harmed her; on the contrary, it has benefited her, for she
+
+looks better this morning than she has done for weeks. I was sorry to
+
+notice that my clumsiness with the safety-pin hurt her. Indeed, it might
+
+have been serious, for the skin of her throat was pierced. I must have
+
+pinched up a piece of loose skin and have transfixed it, for there are
+
+two little red points like pin-pricks, and on the band of her nightdress
+
+was a drop of blood. When I apologised and was concerned about it, she
+
+laughed and petted me, and said she did not even feel it. Fortunately it
+
+cannot leave a scar, as it is so tiny.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_Same day, night._--We passed a happy day. The air was clear, and the
+
+sun bright, and there was a cool breeze. We took our lunch to Mulgrave
+
+Woods, Mrs. Westenra driving by the road and Lucy and I walking by the
+
+cliff-path and joining her at the gate. I felt a little sad myself, for
+
+I could not but feel how _absolutely_ happy it would have been had
+
+Jonathan been with me. But there! I must only be patient. In the evening
+
+we strolled in the Casino Terrace, and heard some good music by Spohr
+
+and Mackenzie, and went to bed early. Lucy seems more restful than she
+
+has been for some time, and fell asleep at once. I shall lock the door
+
+and secure the key the same as before, though I do not expect any
+
+trouble to-night.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_12 August._--My expectations were wrong, for twice during the night I
+
+was wakened by Lucy trying to get out. She seemed, even in her sleep, to
+
+be a little impatient at finding the door shut, and went back to bed
+
+under a sort of protest. I woke with the dawn, and heard the birds
+
+chirping outside of the window. Lucy woke, too, and, I was glad to see,
+
+was even better than on the previous morning. All her old gaiety of
+
+manner seemed to have come back, and she came and snuggled in beside me
+
+and told me all about Arthur. I told her how anxious I was about
+
+Jonathan, and then she tried to comfort me. Well, she succeeded
+
+somewhat, for, though sympathy can�t alter facts, it can help to make
+
+them more bearable.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_13 August._--Another quiet day, and to bed with the key on my wrist as
+
+before. Again I awoke in the night, and found Lucy sitting up in bed,
+
+still asleep, pointing to the window. I got up quietly, and pulling
+
+aside the blind, looked out. It was brilliant moonlight, and the soft
+
+effect of the light over the sea and sky--merged together in one great,
+
+silent mystery--was beautiful beyond words. Between me and the moonlight
+
+flitted a great bat, coming and going in great whirling circles. Once or
+
+twice it came quite close, but was, I suppose, frightened at seeing me,
+
+and flitted away across the harbour towards the abbey. When I came back
+
+from the window Lucy had lain down again, and was sleeping peacefully.
+
+She did not stir again all night.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_14 August._--On the East Cliff, reading and writing all day. Lucy seems
+
+to have become as much in love with the spot as I am, and it is hard to
+
+get her away from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea or
+
+dinner. This afternoon she made a funny remark. We were coming home for
+
+dinner, and had come to the top of the steps up from the West Pier and
+
+stopped to look at the view, as we generally do. The setting sun, low
+
+down in the sky, was just dropping behind Kettleness; the red light was
+
+thrown over on the East Cliff and the old abbey, and seemed to bathe
+
+everything in a beautiful rosy glow. We were silent for a while, and
+
+suddenly Lucy murmured as if to herself:--
+
+�His red eyes again! They are just the same.� It was such an odd
+
+expression, coming _apropos_ of nothing, that it quite startled me. I
+
+slewed round a little, so as to see Lucy well without seeming to stare
+
+at her, and saw that she was in a half-dreamy state, with an odd look on
+
+her face that I could not quite make out; so I said nothing, but
+
+followed her eyes. She appeared to be looking over at our own seat,
+
+whereon was a dark figure seated alone. I was a little startled myself,
+
+for it seemed for an instant as if the stranger had great eyes like
+
+burning flames; but a second look dispelled the illusion. The red
+
+sunlight was shining on the windows of St. Mary�s Church behind our
+
+seat, and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in the
+
+refraction and reflection to make it appear as if the light moved. I
+
+called Lucy�s attention to the peculiar effect, and she became herself
+
+with a start, but she looked sad all the same; it may have been that she
+
+was thinking of that terrible night up there. We never refer to it; so I
+
+said nothing, and we went home to dinner. Lucy had a headache and went
+
+early to bed. I saw her asleep, and went out for a little stroll myself;
+
+I walked along the cliffs to the westward, and was full of sweet
+
+sadness, for I was thinking of Jonathan. When coming home--it was then
+
+bright moonlight, so bright that, though the front of our part of the
+
+Crescent was in shadow, everything could be well seen--I threw a glance
+
+up at our window, and saw Lucy�s head leaning out. I thought that
+
+perhaps she was looking out for me, so I opened my handkerchief and
+
+waved it. She did not notice or make any movement whatever. Just then,
+
+the moonlight crept round an angle of the building, and the light fell
+
+on the window. There distinctly was Lucy with her head lying up against
+
+the side of the window-sill and her eyes shut. She was fast asleep, and
+
+by her, seated on the window-sill, was something that looked like a
+
+good-sized bird. I was afraid she might get a chill, so I ran upstairs,
+
+but as I came into the room she was moving back to her bed, fast
+
+asleep, and breathing heavily; she was holding her hand to her throat,
+
+as though to protect it from cold.
+
+I did not wake her, but tucked her up warmly; I have taken care that the
+
+door is locked and the window securely fastened.
+
+She looks so sweet as she sleeps; but she is paler than is her wont, and
+
+there is a drawn, haggard look under her eyes which I do not like. I
+
+fear she is fretting about something. I wish I could find out what it
+
+is.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_15 August._--Rose later than usual. Lucy was languid and tired, and
+
+slept on after we had been called. We had a happy surprise at breakfast.
+
+Arthur�s father is better, and wants the marriage to come off soon. Lucy
+
+is full of quiet joy, and her mother is glad and sorry at once. Later on
+
+in the day she told me the cause. She is grieved to lose Lucy as her
+
+very own, but she is rejoiced that she is soon to have some one to
+
+protect her. Poor dear, sweet lady! She confided to me that she has got
+
+her death-warrant. She has not told Lucy, and made me promise secrecy;
+
+her doctor told her that within a few months, at most, she must die, for
+
+her heart is weakening. At any time, even now, a sudden shock would be
+
+almost sure to kill her. Ah, we were wise to keep from her the affair of
+
+the dreadful night of Lucy�s sleep-walking.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_17 August._--No diary for two whole days. I have not had the heart to
+
+write. Some sort of shadowy pall seems to be coming over our happiness.
+
+No news from Jonathan, and Lucy seems to be growing weaker, whilst her
+
+mother�s hours are numbering to a close. I do not understand Lucy�s
+
+fading away as she is doing. She eats well and sleeps well, and enjoys
+
+the fresh air; but all the time the roses in her cheeks are fading, and
+
+she gets weaker and more languid day by day; at night I hear her gasping
+
+as if for air. I keep the key of our door always fastened to my wrist at
+
+night, but she gets up and walks about the room, and sits at the open
+
+window. Last night I found her leaning out when I woke up, and when I
+
+tried to wake her I could not; she was in a faint. When I managed to
+
+restore her she was as weak as water, and cried silently between long,
+
+painful struggles for breath. When I asked her how she came to be at the
+
+window she shook her head and turned away. I trust her feeling ill may
+
+not be from that unlucky prick of the safety-pin. I looked at her throat
+
+just now as she lay asleep, and the tiny wounds seem not to have healed.
+
+They are still open, and, if anything, larger than before, and the
+
+edges of them are faintly white. They are like little white dots with
+
+red centres. Unless they heal within a day or two, I shall insist on the
+
+doctor seeing about them.

+
+_18 August._--I am happy to-day, and write sitting on the seat in the
+
+churchyard. Lucy is ever so much better. Last night she slept well all
+
+night, and did not disturb me once. The roses seem coming back already
+
+to her cheeks, though she is still sadly pale and wan-looking. If she
+
+were in any way an�mic I could understand it, but she is not. She is in
+
+gay spirits and full of life and cheerfulness. All the morbid reticence
+
+seems to have passed from her, and she has just reminded me, as if I
+
+needed any reminding, of _that_ night, and that it was here, on this
+
+very seat, I found her asleep. As she told me she tapped playfully with
+
+the heel of her boot on the stone slab and said:--
+
+�My poor little feet didn�t make much noise then! I daresay poor old Mr.
+
+Swales would have told me that it was because I didn�t want to wake up
+
+Geordie.� As she was in such a communicative humour, I asked her if she
+
+had dreamed at all that night. Before she answered, that sweet, puckered
+
+look came into her forehead, which Arthur--I call him Arthur from her
+
+habit--says he loves; and, indeed, I don�t wonder that he does. Then she
+
+went on in a half-dreaming kind of way, as if trying to recall it to
+
+herself:--
+
+�I didn�t quite dream; but it all seemed to be real. I only wanted to be
+
+here in this spot--I don�t know why, for I was afraid of something--I
+
+don�t know what. I remember, though I suppose I was asleep, passing
+
+through the streets and over the bridge. A fish leaped as I went by, and
+
+I leaned over to look at it, and I heard a lot of dogs howling--the
+
+whole town seemed as if it must be full of dogs all howling at once--as
+
+I went up the steps. Then I had a vague memory of something long and
+
+dark with red eyes, just as we saw in the sunset, and something very
+
+sweet and very bitter all around me at once; and then I seemed sinking
+
+into deep green water, and there was a singing in my ears, as I have
+
+heard there is to drowning men; and then everything seemed passing away
+
+from me; my soul seemed to go out from my body and float about the air.
+
+I seem to remember that once the West Lighthouse was right under me,
+
+and then there was a sort of agonising feeling, as if I were in an
+
+earthquake, and I came back and found you shaking my body. I saw you do
+
+it before I felt you.�
+
+Then she began to laugh. It seemed a little uncanny to me, and I
+
+listened to her breathlessly. I did not quite like it, and thought it
+
+better not to keep her mind on the subject, so we drifted on to other
+
+subjects, and Lucy was like her old self again. When we got home the
+
+fresh breeze had braced her up, and her pale cheeks were really more
+
+rosy. Her mother rejoiced when she saw her, and we all spent a very
+
+happy evening together.

+_19 August._--Joy, joy, joy! although not all joy. At last, news of
+
+Jonathan. The dear fellow has been ill; that is why he did not write. I
+
+am not afraid to think it or say it, now that I know. Mr. Hawkins sent
+
+me on the letter, and wrote himself, oh, so kindly. I am to leave in the
+
+morning and go over to Jonathan, and to help to nurse him if necessary,
+
+and to bring him home. Mr. Hawkins says it would not be a bad thing if
+
+we were to be married out there. I have cried over the good Sister�s
+
+letter till I can feel it wet against my bosom, where it lies. It is of
+
+Jonathan, and must be next my heart, for he is _in_ my heart. My journey
+
+is all mapped out, and my luggage ready. I am only taking one change of
+
+dress; Lucy will bring my trunk to London and keep it till I send for
+
+it, for it may be that ... I must write no more; I must keep it to say
+
+to Jonathan, my husband. The letter that he has seen and touched must
+
+comfort me till we meet.
+
+_Letter, Sister Agatha, Hospital of St. Joseph and Ste. Mary,
+
+Buda-Pesth, to Miss Wilhelmina Murray._
+
+�_12 August._
+
+�Dear Madam,--
+
+�I write by desire of Mr. Jonathan Harker, who is himself not strong
+
+enough to write, though progressing well, thanks to God and St. Joseph
+
+and Ste. Mary. He has been under our care for nearly six weeks,
+
+suffering from a violent brain fever. He wishes me to convey his love,
+
+and to say that by this post I write for him to Mr. Peter Hawkins,
+
+Exeter, to say, with his dutiful respects, that he is sorry for his
+
+delay, and that all of his work is completed. He will require some few
+
+weeks� rest in our sanatorium in the hills, but will then return. He
+
+wishes me to say that he has not sufficient money with him, and that he
+
+would like to pay for his staying here, so that others who need shall
+
+not be wanting for help.
+
+�Believe me,
+
+�Yours, with sympathy and all blessings,
+
+�SISTER AGATHA.
+
+�P. S.--My patient being asleep, I open this to let you know something
+
+more. He has told me all about you, and that you are shortly to be his
+
+wife. All blessings to you both! He has had some fearful shock--so says
+
+our doctor--and in his delirium his ravings have been dreadful; of
+
+wolves and poison and blood; of ghosts and demons; and I fear to say of
+
+what. Be careful with him always that there may be nothing to excite him
+
+of this kind for a long time to come; the traces of such an illness as
+
+his do not lightly die away. We should have written long ago, but we
+
+knew nothing of his friends, and there was on him nothing that any one
+
+could understand. He came in the train from Klausenburg, and the guard
+
+was told by the station-master there that he rushed into the station
+
+shouting for a ticket for home. Seeing from his violent demeanour that
+
+he was English, they gave him a ticket for the furthest station on the
+
+way thither that the train reached.
+
+�Be assured that he is well cared for. He has won all hearts by his
+
+sweetness and gentleness. He is truly getting on well, and I have no
+
+doubt will in a few weeks be all himself. But be careful of him for
+
+safety�s sake. There are, I pray God and St. Joseph and Ste. Mary, many,
+
+many, happy years for you both.�
+
+_Dr. Seward�s Diary._
+
+_19 August._--Strange and sudden change in Renfield last night. About
+
+eight o�clock he began to get excited and sniff about as a dog does when
+
+setting. The attendant was struck by his manner, and knowing my interest
+
+in him, encouraged him to talk. He is usually respectful to the
+
+attendant and at times servile; but to-night, the man tells me, he was
+
+quite haughty. Would not condescend to talk with him at all. All he
+
+would say was:--
+
+�I don�t want to talk to you: you don�t count now; the Master is at
+
+hand.�
+
+The attendant thinks it is some sudden form of religious mania which has
+
+seized him. If so, we must look out for squalls, for a strong man with
+
+homicidal and religious mania at once might be dangerous. The
+
+combination is a dreadful one. At nine o�clock I visited him myself. His
+
+attitude to me was the same as that to the attendant; in his sublime
+
+self-feeling the difference between myself and attendant seemed to him
+
+as nothing. It looks like religious mania, and he will soon think that
+
+he himself is God. These infinitesimal distinctions between man and man
+
+are too paltry for an Omnipotent Being. How these madmen give themselves
+
+away! The real God taketh heed lest a sparrow fall; but the God created
+
+from human vanity sees no difference between an eagle and a sparrow. Oh,
+
+if men only knew!
+
+For half an hour or more Renfield kept getting excited in greater and
+
+greater degree. I did not pretend to be watching him, but I kept strict
+
+observation all the same. All at once that shifty look came into his
+
+eyes which we always see when a madman has seized an idea, and with it
+
+the shifty movement of the head and back which asylum attendants come to
+
+know so well. He became quite quiet, and went and sat on the edge of his
+
+bed resignedly, and looked into space with lack-lustre eyes. I thought I
+
+would find out if his apathy were real or only assumed, and tried to
+
+lead him to talk of his pets, a theme which had never failed to excite
+
+his attention. At first he made no reply, but at length said testily:--
+
+�Bother them all! I don�t care a pin about them.�
+
+�What?� I said. �You don�t mean to tell me you don�t care about
+
+spiders?� (Spiders at present are his hobby and the note-book is filling
+
+up with columns of small figures.) To this he answered enigmatically:--
+
+�The bride-maidens rejoice the eyes that wait the coming of the bride;
+
+but when the bride draweth nigh, then the maidens shine not to the eyes
+
+that are filled.�
+
+He would not explain himself, but remained obstinately seated on his bed
+
+all the time I remained with him.
+
+I am weary to-night and low in spirits. I cannot but think of Lucy, and
+
+how different things might have been. If I don�t sleep at once, chloral,
+
+the modern Morpheus--C_{2}HCl_{3}O. H_{2}O! I must be careful not to let
+
+it grow into a habit. No, I shall take none to-night! I have thought of
+
+Lucy, and I shall not dishonour her by mixing the two. If need be,
+
+to-night shall be sleepless....
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_Later._--Glad I made the resolution; gladder that I kept to it. I had
+
+lain tossing about, and had heard the clock strike only twice, when the
+
+night-watchman came to me, sent up from the ward, to say that Renfield
+
+had escaped. I threw on my clothes and ran down at once; my patient is
+
+too dangerous a person to be roaming about. Those ideas of his might
+
+work out dangerously with strangers. The attendant was waiting for me.
+
+He said he had seen him not ten minutes before, seemingly asleep in his
+
+bed, when he had looked through the observation-trap in the door. His
+
+attention was called by the sound of the window being wrenched out. He
+
+ran back and saw his feet disappear through the window, and had at once
+
+sent up for me. He was only in his night-gear, and cannot be far off.
+
+The attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where he should
+
+go than to follow him, as he might lose sight of him whilst getting out
+
+of the building by the door. He is a bulky man, and couldn�t get through
+
+the window. I am thin, so, with his aid, I got out, but feet foremost,
+
+and, as we were only a few feet above ground, landed unhurt. The
+
+attendant told me the patient had gone to the left, and had taken a
+
+straight line, so I ran as quickly as I could. As I got through the belt
+
+of trees I saw a white figure scale the high wall which separates our
+
+grounds from those of the deserted house.
+
+I ran back at once, told the watchman to get three or four men
+
+immediately and follow me into the grounds of Carfax, in case our friend
+
+might be dangerous. I got a ladder myself, and crossing the wall,
+
+dropped down on the other side. I could see Renfield�s figure just
+
+disappearing behind the angle of the house, so I ran after him. On the
+
+far side of the house I found him pressed close against the old
+
+ironbound oak door of the chapel. He was talking, apparently to some
+
+one, but I was afraid to go near enough to hear what he was saying, lest
+
+I might frighten him, and he should run off. Chasing an errant swarm of
+
+bees is nothing to following a naked lunatic, when the fit of escaping
+
+is upon him! After a few minutes, however, I could see that he did not
+
+take note of anything around him, and so ventured to draw nearer to
+
+him--the more so as my men had now crossed the wall and were closing him
+
+in. I heard him say:--
+
+�I am here to do Your bidding, Master. I am Your slave, and You will
+
+reward me, for I shall be faithful. I have worshipped You long and afar
+
+off. Now that You are near, I await Your commands, and You will not pass
+
+me by, will You, dear Master, in Your distribution of good things?�
+
+He _is_ a selfish old beggar anyhow. He thinks of the loaves and fishes
+
+even when he believes he is in a Real Presence. His manias make a
+
+startling combination. When we closed in on him he fought like a tiger.
+
+He is immensely strong, for he was more like a wild beast than a man. I
+
+never saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage before; and I hope I
+
+shall not again. It is a mercy that we have found out his strength and
+
+his danger in good time. With strength and determination like his, he
+
+might have done wild work before he was caged. He is safe now at any
+
+rate. Jack Sheppard himself couldn�t get free from the strait-waistcoat
+
+that keeps him restrained, and he�s chained to the wall in the padded
+
+room. His cries are at times awful, but the silences that follow are
+
+more deadly still, for he means murder in every turn and movement.
+
+Just now he spoke coherent words for the first time:--
+
+�I shall be patient, Master. It is coming--coming--coming!�
+
+So I took the hint, and came too. I was too excited to sleep, but this
+
+diary has quieted me, and I feel I shall get some sleep to-night.

+CHAPTER XXIII
+
+DR. SEWARD�S DIARY
+
+_3 October._--The time seemed terribly long whilst we were waiting for
+
+the coming of Godalming and Quincey Morris. The Professor tried to keep
+
+our minds active by using them all the time. I could see his beneficent
+
+purpose, by the side glances which he threw from time to time at Harker.
+
+The poor fellow is overwhelmed in a misery that is appalling to see.
+
+Last night he was a frank, happy-looking man, with strong, youthful
+
+face, full of energy, and with dark brown hair. To-day he is a drawn,
+
+haggard old man, whose white hair matches well with the hollow burning
+
+eyes and grief-written lines of his face. His energy is still intact; in
+
+fact, he is like a living flame. This may yet be his salvation, for, if
+
+all go well, it will tide him over the despairing period; he will then,
+
+in a kind of way, wake again to the realities of life. Poor fellow, I
+
+thought my own trouble was bad enough, but his----! The Professor knows
+
+this well enough, and is doing his best to keep his mind active. What he
+
+has been saying was, under the circumstances, of absorbing interest. So
+
+well as I can remember, here it is:--
+
+�I have studied, over and over again since they came into my hands, all
+
+the papers relating to this monster; and the more I have studied, the
+
+greater seems the necessity to utterly stamp him out. All through there
+
+are signs of his advance; not only of his power, but of his knowledge of
+
+it. As I learned from the researches of my friend Arminus of Buda-Pesth,
+
+he was in life a most wonderful man. Soldier, statesman, and
+
+alchemist--which latter was the highest development of the
+
+science-knowledge of his time. He had a mighty brain, a learning beyond
+
+compare, and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse. He dared even to
+
+attend the Scholomance, and there was no branch of knowledge of his time
+
+that he did not essay. Well, in him the brain powers survived the
+
+physical death; though it would seem that memory was not all complete.
+
+In some faculties of mind he has been, and is, only a child; but he is
+
+growing, and some things that were childish at the first are now of
+
+man�s stature. He is experimenting, and doing it well; and if it had not
+
+been that we have crossed his path he would be yet--he may be yet if we
+
+fail--the father or furtherer of a new order of beings, whose road must
+
+lead through Death, not Life.�
+
+Harker groaned and said, �And this is all arrayed against my darling!
+
+But how is he experimenting? The knowledge may help us to defeat him!�
+
+�He has all along, since his coming, been trying his power, slowly but
+
+surely; that big child-brain of his is working. Well for us, it is, as
+
+yet, a child-brain; for had he dared, at the first, to attempt certain
+
+things he would long ago have been beyond our power. However, he means
+
+to succeed, and a man who has centuries before him can afford to wait
+
+and to go slow. _Festina lente_ may well be his motto.�
+
+�I fail to understand,� said Harker wearily. �Oh, do be more plain to
+
+me! Perhaps grief and trouble are dulling my brain.�
+
+The Professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as he spoke:--
+
+�Ah, my child, I will be plain. Do you not see how, of late, this
+
+monster has been creeping into knowledge experimentally. How he has been
+
+making use of the zo�phagous patient to effect his entry into friend
+
+John�s home; for your Vampire, though in all afterwards he can come when
+
+and how he will, must at the first make entry only when asked thereto by
+
+an inmate. But these are not his most important experiments. Do we not
+
+see how at the first all these so great boxes were moved by others. He
+
+knew not then but that must be so. But all the time that so great
+
+child-brain of his was growing, and he began to consider whether he
+
+might not himself move the box. So he began to help; and then, when he
+
+found that this be all-right, he try to move them all alone. And so he
+
+progress, and he scatter these graves of him; and none but he know where
+
+they are hidden. He may have intend to bury them deep in the ground. So
+
+that he only use them in the night, or at such time as he can change his
+
+form, they do him equal well; and none may know these are his
+
+hiding-place! But, my child, do not despair; this knowledge come to him
+
+just too late! Already all of his lairs but one be sterilise as for him;
+
+and before the sunset this shall be so. Then he have no place where he
+
+can move and hide. I delayed this morning that so we might be sure. Is
+
+there not more at stake for us than for him? Then why we not be even
+
+more careful than him? By my clock it is one hour and already, if all be
+
+well, friend Arthur and Quincey are on their way to us. To-day is our
+
+day, and we must go sure, if slow, and lose no chance. See! there are
+
+five of us when those absent ones return.�
+
+Whilst he was speaking we were startled by a knock at the hall door, the
+
+double postman�s knock of the telegraph boy. We all moved out to the
+
+hall with one impulse, and Van Helsing, holding up his hand to us to
+
+keep silence, stepped to the door and opened it. The boy handed in a
+
+despatch. The Professor closed the door again, and, after looking at the
+
+direction, opened it and read aloud.
+
+�Look out for D. He has just now, 12:45, come from Carfax hurriedly and
+
+hastened towards the South. He seems to be going the round and may want
+
+to see you: Mina.�
+
+There was a pause, broken by Jonathan Harker�s voice:--
+
+�Now, God be thanked, we shall soon meet!� Van Helsing turned to him
+
+quickly and said:--
+
+�God will act in His own way and time. Do not fear, and do not rejoice
+
+as yet; for what we wish for at the moment may be our undoings.�
+
+�I care for nothing now,� he answered hotly, �except to wipe out this
+
+brute from the face of creation. I would sell my soul to do it!�
+
+�Oh, hush, hush, my child!� said Van Helsing. �God does not purchase
+
+souls in this wise; and the Devil, though he may purchase, does not keep
+
+faith. But God is merciful and just, and knows your pain and your
+
+devotion to that dear Madam Mina. Think you, how her pain would be
+
+doubled, did she but hear your wild words. Do not fear any of us, we are
+
+all devoted to this cause, and to-day shall see the end. The time is
+
+coming for action; to-day this Vampire is limit to the powers of man,
+
+and till sunset he may not change. It will take him time to arrive
+
+here--see, it is twenty minutes past one--and there are yet some times
+
+before he can hither come, be he never so quick. What we must hope for
+
+is that my Lord Arthur and Quincey arrive first.�
+
+About half an hour after we had received Mrs. Harker�s telegram, there
+
+came a quiet, resolute knock at the hall door. It was just an ordinary
+
+knock, such as is given hourly by thousands of gentlemen, but it made
+
+the Professor�s heart and mine beat loudly. We looked at each other, and
+
+together moved out into the hall; we each held ready to use our various
+
+armaments--the spiritual in the left hand, the mortal in the right. Van
+
+Helsing pulled back the latch, and, holding the door half open, stood
+
+back, having both hands ready for action. The gladness of our hearts
+
+must have shown upon our faces when on the step, close to the door, we
+
+saw Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris. They came quickly in and closed
+
+the door behind them, the former saying, as they moved along the
+
+hall:--
+
+�It is all right. We found both places; six boxes in each and we
+
+destroyed them all!�
+
+�Destroyed?� asked the Professor.
+
+�For him!� We were silent for a minute, and then Quincey said:--
+
+�There�s nothing to do but to wait here. If, however, he doesn�t turn up
+
+by five o�clock, we must start off; for it won�t do to leave Mrs. Harker
+
+alone after sunset.�
+
+�He will be here before long now,� said Van Helsing, who had been
+
+consulting his pocket-book. �_Nota bene_, in Madam�s telegram he went
+
+south from Carfax, that means he went to cross the river, and he could
+
+only do so at slack of tide, which should be something before one
+
+o�clock. That he went south has a meaning for us. He is as yet only
+
+suspicious; and he went from Carfax first to the place where he would
+
+suspect interference least. You must have been at Bermondsey only a
+
+short time before him. That he is not here already shows that he went to
+
+Mile End next. This took him some time; for he would then have to be
+
+carried over the river in some way. Believe me, my friends, we shall not
+
+have long to wait now. We should have ready some plan of attack, so that
+
+we may throw away no chance. Hush, there is no time now. Have all your
+
+arms! Be ready!� He held up a warning hand as he spoke, for we all could
+
+hear a key softly inserted in the lock of the hall door.
+
+I could not but admire, even at such a moment, the way in which a
+
+dominant spirit asserted itself. In all our hunting parties and
+
+adventures in different parts of the world, Quincey Morris had always
+
+been the one to arrange the plan of action, and Arthur and I had been
+
+accustomed to obey him implicitly. Now, the old habit seemed to be
+
+renewed instinctively. With a swift glance around the room, he at once
+
+laid out our plan of attack, and, without speaking a word, with a
+
+gesture, placed us each in position. Van Helsing, Harker, and I were
+
+just behind the door, so that when it was opened the Professor could
+
+guard it whilst we two stepped between the incomer and the door.
+
+Godalming behind and Quincey in front stood just out of sight ready to
+
+move in front of the window. We waited in a suspense that made the
+
+seconds pass with nightmare slowness. The slow, careful steps came along
+
+the hall; the Count was evidently prepared for some surprise--at least
+
+he feared it.
+
+Suddenly with a single bound he leaped into the room, winning a way past
+
+us before any of us could raise a hand to stay him. There was something
+
+so panther-like in the movement--something so unhuman, that it seemed
+
+to sober us all from the shock of his coming. The first to act was
+
+Harker, who, with a quick movement, threw himself before the door
+
+leading into the room in the front of the house. As the Count saw us, a
+
+horrible sort of snarl passed over his face, showing the eye-teeth long
+
+and pointed; but the evil smile as quickly passed into a cold stare of
+
+lion-like disdain. His expression again changed as, with a single
+
+impulse, we all advanced upon him. It was a pity that we had not some
+
+better organised plan of attack, for even at the moment I wondered what
+
+we were to do. I did not myself know whether our lethal weapons would
+
+avail us anything. Harker evidently meant to try the matter, for he had
+
+ready his great Kukri knife and made a fierce and sudden cut at him. The
+
+blow was a powerful one; only the diabolical quickness of the Count�s
+
+leap back saved him. A second less and the trenchant blade had shorne
+
+through his heart. As it was, the point just cut the cloth of his coat,
+
+making a wide gap whence a bundle of bank-notes and a stream of gold
+
+fell out. The expression of the Count�s face was so hellish, that for a
+
+moment I feared for Harker, though I saw him throw the terrible knife
+
+aloft again for another stroke. Instinctively I moved forward with a
+
+protective impulse, holding the Crucifix and Wafer in my left hand. I
+
+felt a mighty power fly along my arm; and it was without surprise that I
+
+saw the monster cower back before a similar movement made spontaneously
+
+by each one of us. It would be impossible to describe the expression of
+
+hate and baffled malignity--of anger and hellish rage--which came over
+
+the Count�s face. His waxen hue became greenish-yellow by the contrast
+
+of his burning eyes, and the red scar on the forehead showed on the
+
+pallid skin like a palpitating wound. The next instant, with a sinuous
+
+dive he swept under Harker�s arm, ere his blow could fall, and, grasping
+
+a handful of the money from the floor, dashed across the room, threw
+
+himself at the window. Amid the crash and glitter of the falling glass,
+
+he tumbled into the flagged area below. Through the sound of the
+
+shivering glass I could hear the �ting� of the gold, as some of the
+
+sovereigns fell on the flagging.
+
+We ran over and saw him spring unhurt from the ground. He, rushing up
+
+the steps, crossed the flagged yard, and pushed open the stable door.
+
+There he turned and spoke to us:--
+
+�You think to baffle me, you--with your pale faces all in a row, like
+
+sheep in a butcher�s. You shall be sorry yet, each one of you! You think
+
+you have left me without a place to rest; but I have more. My revenge is
+
+just begun! I spread it over centuries, and time is on my side. Your
+
+girls that you all love are mine already; and through them you and
+
+others shall yet be mine--my creatures, to do my bidding and to be my
+
+jackals when I want to feed. Bah!� With a contemptuous sneer, he passed
+
+quickly through the door, and we heard the rusty bolt creak as he
+
+fastened it behind him. A door beyond opened and shut. The first of us
+
+to speak was the Professor, as, realising the difficulty of following
+
+him through the stable, we moved toward the hall.
+
+�We have learnt something--much! Notwithstanding his brave words, he
+
+fears us; he fear time, he fear want! For if not, why he hurry so? His
+
+very tone betray him, or my ears deceive. Why take that money? You
+
+follow quick. You are hunters of wild beast, and understand it so. For
+
+me, I make sure that nothing here may be of use to him, if so that he
+
+return.� As he spoke he put the money remaining into his pocket; took
+
+the title-deeds in the bundle as Harker had left them, and swept the
+
+remaining things into the open fireplace, where he set fire to them with
+
+a match.
+
+Godalming and Morris had rushed out into the yard, and Harker had
+
+lowered himself from the window to follow the Count. He had, however,
+
+bolted the stable door; and by the time they had forced it open there
+
+was no sign of him. Van Helsing and I tried to make inquiry at the back
+
+of the house; but the mews was deserted and no one had seen him depart.
+
+It was now late in the afternoon, and sunset was not far off. We had to
+
+recognise that our game was up; with heavy hearts we agreed with the
+
+Professor when he said:--
+
+�Let us go back to Madam Mina--poor, poor dear Madam Mina. All we can do
+
+just now is done; and we can there, at least, protect her. But we need
+
+not despair. There is but one more earth-box, and we must try to find
+
+it; when that is done all may yet be well.� I could see that he spoke as
+
+bravely as he could to comfort Harker. The poor fellow was quite broken
+
+down; now and again he gave a low groan which he could not suppress--he
+
+was thinking of his wife.
+
+With sad hearts we came back to my house, where we found Mrs. Harker
+
+waiting us, with an appearance of cheerfulness which did honour to her
+
+bravery and unselfishness. When she saw our faces, her own became as
+
+pale as death: for a second or two her eyes were closed as if she were
+
+in secret prayer; and then she said cheerfully:--
+
+�I can never thank you all enough. Oh, my poor darling!� As she spoke,
+
+she took her husband�s grey head in her hands and kissed it--�Lay your
+
+poor head here and rest it. All will yet be well, dear! God will protect
+
+us if He so will it in His good intent.� The poor fellow groaned. There
+
+was no place for words in his sublime misery.
+
+We had a sort of perfunctory supper together, and I think it cheered us
+
+all up somewhat. It was, perhaps, the mere animal heat of food to hungry
+
+people--for none of us had eaten anything since breakfast--or the sense
+
+of companionship may have helped us; but anyhow we were all less
+
+miserable, and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope. True to
+
+our promise, we told Mrs. Harker everything which had passed; and
+
+although she grew snowy white at times when danger had seemed to
+
+threaten her husband, and red at others when his devotion to her was
+
+manifested, she listened bravely and with calmness. When we came to the
+
+part where Harker had rushed at the Count so recklessly, she clung to
+
+her husband�s arm, and held it tight as though her clinging could
+
+protect him from any harm that might come. She said nothing, however,
+
+till the narration was all done, and matters had been brought right up
+
+to the present time. Then without letting go her husband�s hand she
+
+stood up amongst us and spoke. Oh, that I could give any idea of the
+
+scene; of that sweet, sweet, good, good woman in all the radiant beauty
+
+of her youth and animation, with the red scar on her forehead, of which
+
+she was conscious, and which we saw with grinding of our
+
+teeth--remembering whence and how it came; her loving kindness against
+
+our grim hate; her tender faith against all our fears and doubting; and
+
+we, knowing that so far as symbols went, she with all her goodness and
+
+purity and faith, was outcast from God.
+
+�Jonathan,� she said, and the word sounded like music on her lips it was
+
+so full of love and tenderness, �Jonathan dear, and you all my true,
+
+true friends, I want you to bear something in mind through all this
+
+dreadful time. I know that you must fight--that you must destroy even as
+
+you destroyed the false Lucy so that the true Lucy might live hereafter;
+
+but it is not a work of hate. That poor soul who has wrought all this
+
+misery is the saddest case of all. Just think what will be his joy when
+
+he, too, is destroyed in his worser part that his better part may have
+
+spiritual immortality. You must be pitiful to him, too, though it may
+
+not hold your hands from his destruction.�
+
+As she spoke I could see her husband�s face darken and draw together, as
+
+though the passion in him were shrivelling his being to its core.
+
+Instinctively the clasp on his wife�s hand grew closer, till his
+
+knuckles looked white. She did not flinch from the pain which I knew she
+
+must have suffered, but looked at him with eyes that were more appealing
+
+than ever. As she stopped speaking he leaped to his feet, almost tearing
+
+his hand from hers as he spoke:--
+
+�May God give him into my hand just for long enough to destroy that
+
+earthly life of him which we are aiming at. If beyond it I could send
+
+his soul for ever and ever to burning hell I would do it!�
+
+�Oh, hush! oh, hush! in the name of the good God. Don�t say such things,
+
+Jonathan, my husband; or you will crush me with fear and horror. Just
+
+think, my dear--I have been thinking all this long, long day of it--that
+
+... perhaps ... some day ... I, too, may need such pity; and that some
+
+other like you--and with equal cause for anger--may deny it to me! Oh,
+
+my husband! my husband, indeed I would have spared you such a thought
+
+had there been another way; but I pray that God may not have treasured
+
+your wild words, except as the heart-broken wail of a very loving and
+
+sorely stricken man. Oh, God, let these poor white hairs go in evidence
+
+of what he has suffered, who all his life has done no wrong, and on whom
+
+so many sorrows have come.�
+
+We men were all in tears now. There was no resisting them, and we wept
+
+openly. She wept, too, to see that her sweeter counsels had prevailed.
+
+Her husband flung himself on his knees beside her, and putting his arms
+
+round her, hid his face in the folds of her dress. Van Helsing beckoned
+
+to us and we stole out of the room, leaving the two loving hearts alone
+
+with their God.
+
+Before they retired the Professor fixed up the room against any coming
+
+of the Vampire, and assured Mrs. Harker that she might rest in peace.
+
+She tried to school herself to the belief, and, manifestly for her
+
+husband�s sake, tried to seem content. It was a brave struggle; and was,
+
+I think and believe, not without its reward. Van Helsing had placed at
+
+hand a bell which either of them was to sound in case of any emergency.
+
+When they had retired, Quincey, Godalming, and I arranged that we should
+
+sit up, dividing the night between us, and watch over the safety of the
+
+poor stricken lady. The first watch falls to Quincey, so the rest of us
+
+shall be off to bed as soon as we can. Godalming has already turned in,
+
+for his is the second watch. Now that my work is done I, too, shall go
+
+to bed.
+
+_Jonathan Harker�s Journal._
+
+_3-4 October, close to midnight._--I thought yesterday would never end.
+
+There was over me a yearning for sleep, in some sort of blind belief
+
+that to wake would be to find things changed, and that any change must
+
+now be for the better. Before we parted, we discussed what our next step
+
+was to be, but we could arrive at no result. All we knew was that one
+
+earth-box remained, and that the Count alone knew where it was. If he
+
+chooses to lie hidden, he may baffle us for years; and in the
+
+meantime!--the thought is too horrible, I dare not think of it even now.
+
+This I know: that if ever there was a woman who was all perfection, that
+
+one is my poor wronged darling. I love her a thousand times more for her
+
+sweet pity of last night, a pity that made my own hate of the monster
+
+seem despicable. Surely God will not permit the world to be the poorer
+
+by the loss of such a creature. This is hope to me. We are all drifting
+
+reefwards now, and faith is our only anchor. Thank God! Mina is
+
+sleeping, and sleeping without dreams. I fear what her dreams might be
+
+like, with such terrible memories to ground them in. She has not been so
+
+calm, within my seeing, since the sunset. Then, for a while, there came
+
+over her face a repose which was like spring after the blasts of March.
+
+I thought at the time that it was the softness of the red sunset on her
+
+face, but somehow now I think it has a deeper meaning. I am not sleepy
+
+myself, though I am weary--weary to death. However, I must try to sleep;
+
+for there is to-morrow to think of, and there is no rest for me
+
+until....
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_Later._--I must have fallen asleep, for I was awaked by Mina, who was
+
+sitting up in bed, with a startled look on her face. I could see easily,
+
+for we did not leave the room in darkness; she had placed a warning hand
+
+over my mouth, and now she whispered in my ear:--
+
+�Hush! there is someone in the corridor!� I got up softly, and crossing
+
+the room, gently opened the door.
+
+Just outside, stretched on a mattress, lay Mr. Morris, wide awake. He
+
+raised a warning hand for silence as he whispered to me:--
+
+�Hush! go back to bed; it is all right. One of us will be here all
+
+night. We don�t mean to take any chances!�
+
+His look and gesture forbade discussion, so I came back and told Mina.
+
+She sighed and positively a shadow of a smile stole over her poor, pale
+
+face as she put her arms round me and said softly:--
+
+�Oh, thank God for good brave men!� With a sigh she sank back again to
+
+sleep. I write this now as I am not sleepy, though I must try again.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_4 October, morning._--Once again during the night I was wakened by
+
+Mina. This time we had all had a good sleep, for the grey of the coming
+
+dawn was making the windows into sharp oblongs, and the gas flame was
+
+like a speck rather than a disc of light. She said to me hurriedly:--
+
+�Go, call the Professor. I want to see him at once.�
+
+�Why?� I asked.
+
+�I have an idea. I suppose it must have come in the night, and matured
+
+without my knowing it. He must hypnotise me before the dawn, and then I
+
+shall be able to speak. Go quick, dearest; the time is getting close.� I
+
+went to the door. Dr. Seward was resting on the mattress, and, seeing
+
+me, he sprang to his feet.
+
+�Is anything wrong?� he asked, in alarm.
+
+�No,� I replied; �but Mina wants to see Dr. Van Helsing at once.�
+
+�I will go,� he said, and hurried into the Professor�s room.
+
+In two or three minutes later Van Helsing was in the room in his
+
+dressing-gown, and Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming were with Dr. Seward at
+
+the door asking questions. When the Professor saw Mina smile--a
+
+positive smile ousted the anxiety of his face; he rubbed his hands as he
+
+said:--
+
+�Oh, my dear Madam Mina, this is indeed a change. See! friend Jonathan,
+
+we have got our dear Madam Mina, as of old, back to us to-day!� Then
+
+turning to her, he said, cheerfully: �And what am I do for you? For at
+
+this hour you do not want me for nothings.�
+
+�I want you to hypnotise me!� she said. �Do it before the dawn, for I
+
+feel that then I can speak, and speak freely. Be quick, for the time is
+
+short!� Without a word he motioned her to sit up in bed.
+
+Looking fixedly at her, he commenced to make passes in front of her,
+
+from over the top of her head downward, with each hand in turn. Mina
+
+gazed at him fixedly for a few minutes, during which my own heart beat
+
+like a trip hammer, for I felt that some crisis was at hand. Gradually
+
+her eyes closed, and she sat, stock still; only by the gentle heaving of
+
+her bosom could one know that she was alive. The Professor made a few
+
+more passes and then stopped, and I could see that his forehead was
+
+covered with great beads of perspiration. Mina opened her eyes; but she
+
+did not seem the same woman. There was a far-away look in her eyes, and
+
+her voice had a sad dreaminess which was new to me. Raising his hand to
+
+impose silence, the Professor motioned to me to bring the others in.
+
+They came on tip-toe, closing the door behind them, and stood at the
+
+foot of the bed, looking on. Mina appeared not to see them. The
+
+stillness was broken by Van Helsing�s voice speaking in a low level tone
+
+which would not break the current of her thoughts:--
+
+�Where are you?� The answer came in a neutral way:--
+
+�I do not know. Sleep has no place it can call its own.� For several
+
+minutes there was silence. Mina sat rigid, and the Professor stood
+
+staring at her fixedly; the rest of us hardly dared to breathe. The room
+
+was growing lighter; without taking his eyes from Mina�s face, Dr. Van
+
+Helsing motioned me to pull up the blind. I did so, and the day seemed
+
+just upon us. A red streak shot up, and a rosy light seemed to diffuse
+
+itself through the room. On the instant the Professor spoke again:--
+
+�Where are you now?� The answer came dreamily, but with intention; it
+
+were as though she were interpreting something. I have heard her use the
+
+same tone when reading her shorthand notes.
+
+�I do not know. It is all strange to me!�
+
+�What do you see?�
+
+�I can see nothing; it is all dark.�
+
+�What do you hear?� I could detect the strain in the Professor�s patient
+
+voice.
+
+�The lapping of water. It is gurgling by, and little waves leap. I can
+
+hear them on the outside.�
+
+�Then you are on a ship?� We all looked at each other, trying to glean
+
+something each from the other. We were afraid to think. The answer came
+
+quick:--
+
+�Oh, yes!�
+
+�What else do you hear?�
+
+�The sound of men stamping overhead as they run about. There is the
+
+creaking of a chain, and the loud tinkle as the check of the capstan
+
+falls into the rachet.�
+
+�What are you doing?�
+
+�I am still--oh, so still. It is like death!� The voice faded away into
+
+a deep breath as of one sleeping, and the open eyes closed again.
+
+By this time the sun had risen, and we were all in the full light of
+
+day. Dr. Van Helsing placed his hands on Mina�s shoulders, and laid her
+
+head down softly on her pillow. She lay like a sleeping child for a few
+
+moments, and then, with a long sigh, awoke and stared in wonder to see
+
+us all around her. �Have I been talking in my sleep?� was all she said.
+
+She seemed, however, to know the situation without telling, though she
+
+was eager to know what she had told. The Professor repeated the
+
+conversation, and she said:--
+
+�Then there is not a moment to lose: it may not be yet too late!� Mr.
+
+Morris and Lord Godalming started for the door but the Professor�s calm
+
+voice called them back:--
+
+�Stay, my friends. That ship, wherever it was, was weighing anchor
+
+whilst she spoke. There are many ships weighing anchor at the moment in
+
+your so great Port of London. Which of them is it that you seek? God be
+
+thanked that we have once again a clue, though whither it may lead us we
+
+know not. We have been blind somewhat; blind after the manner of men,
+
+since when we can look back we see what we might have seen looking
+
+forward if we had been able to see what we might have seen! Alas, but
+
+that sentence is a puddle; is it not? We can know now what was in the
+
+Count�s mind, when he seize that money, though Jonathan�s so fierce
+
+knife put him in the danger that even he dread. He meant escape. Hear
+
+me, ESCAPE! He saw that with but one earth-box left, and a pack of men
+
+following like dogs after a fox, this London was no place for him. He
+
+have take his last earth-box on board a ship, and he leave the land. He
+
+think to escape, but no! we follow him. Tally Ho! as friend Arthur would
+
+say when he put on his red frock! Our old fox is wily; oh! so wily, and
+
+we must follow with wile. I, too, am wily and I think his mind in a
+
+little while. In meantime we may rest and in peace, for there are waters
+
+between us which he do not want to pass, and which he could not if he
+
+would--unless the ship were to touch the land, and then only at full or
+
+slack tide. See, and the sun is just rose, and all day to sunset is to
+
+us. Let us take bath, and dress, and have breakfast which we all need,
+
+and which we can eat comfortably since he be not in the same land with
+
+us.� Mina looked at him appealingly as she asked:--
+
+�But why need we seek him further, when he is gone away from us?� He
+
+took her hand and patted it as he replied:--
+
+�Ask me nothings as yet. When we have breakfast, then I answer all
+
+questions.� He would say no more, and we separated to dress.
+
+After breakfast Mina repeated her question. He looked at her gravely for
+
+a minute and then said sorrowfully:--
+
+�Because my dear, dear Madam Mina, now more than ever must we find him
+
+even if we have to follow him to the jaws of Hell!� She grew paler as
+
+she asked faintly:--
+
+�Why?�
+
+�Because,� he answered solemnly, �he can live for centuries, and you are
+
+but mortal woman. Time is now to be dreaded--since once he put that mark
+
+upon your throat.�
+
+I was just in time to catch her as she fell forward in a faint.

+CHAPTER VI
+
+MINA MURRAY�S JOURNAL
+
+_24 July. Whitby._--Lucy met me at the station, looking sweeter and
+
+lovelier than ever, and we drove up to the house at the Crescent in
+
+which they have rooms. This is a lovely place. The little river, the
+
+Esk, runs through a deep valley, which broadens out as it comes near the
+
+harbour. A great viaduct runs across, with high piers, through which the
+
+view seems somehow further away than it really is. The valley is
+
+beautifully green, and it is so steep that when you are on the high land
+
+on either side you look right across it, unless you are near enough to
+
+see down. The houses of the old town--the side away from us--are all
+
+red-roofed, and seem piled up one over the other anyhow, like the
+
+pictures we see of Nuremberg. Right over the town is the ruin of Whitby
+
+Abbey, which was sacked by the Danes, and which is the scene of part of
+
+�Marmion,� where the girl was built up in the wall. It is a most noble
+
+ruin, of immense size, and full of beautiful and romantic bits; there is
+
+a legend that a white lady is seen in one of the windows. Between it and
+
+the town there is another church, the parish one, round which is a big
+
+graveyard, all full of tombstones. This is to my mind the nicest spot in
+
+Whitby, for it lies right over the town, and has a full view of the
+
+harbour and all up the bay to where the headland called Kettleness
+
+stretches out into the sea. It descends so steeply over the harbour that
+
+part of the bank has fallen away, and some of the graves have been
+
+destroyed. In one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches
+
+out over the sandy pathway far below. There are walks, with seats beside
+
+them, through the churchyard; and people go and sit there all day long
+
+looking at the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze. I shall come and
+
+sit here very often myself and work. Indeed, I am writing now, with my
+
+book on my knee, and listening to the talk of three old men who are
+
+sitting beside me. They seem to do nothing all day but sit up here and
+
+talk.
+
+The harbour lies below me, with, on the far side, one long granite wall
+
+stretching out into the sea, with a curve outwards at the end of it, in
+
+the middle of which is a lighthouse. A heavy sea-wall runs along outside
+
+of it. On the near side, the sea-wall makes an elbow crooked inversely,
+
+and its end too has a lighthouse. Between the two piers there is a
+
+narrow opening into the harbour, which then suddenly widens.
+
+It is nice at high water; but when the tide is out it shoals away to
+
+nothing, and there is merely the stream of the Esk, running between
+
+banks of sand, with rocks here and there. Outside the harbour on this
+
+side there rises for about half a mile a great reef, the sharp edge of
+
+which runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse. At the end of
+
+it is a buoy with a bell, which swings in bad weather, and sends in a
+
+mournful sound on the wind. They have a legend here that when a ship is
+
+lost bells are heard out at sea. I must ask the old man about this; he
+
+is coming this way....
+
+He is a funny old man. He must be awfully old, for his face is all
+
+gnarled and twisted like the bark of a tree. He tells me that he is
+
+nearly a hundred, and that he was a sailor in the Greenland fishing
+
+fleet when Waterloo was fought. He is, I am afraid, a very sceptical
+
+person, for when I asked him about the bells at sea and the White Lady
+
+at the abbey he said very brusquely:--
+
+�I wouldn�t fash masel� about them, miss. Them things be all wore out.
+
+Mind, I don�t say that they never was, but I do say that they wasn�t in
+
+my time. They be all very well for comers and trippers, an� the like,
+
+but not for a nice young lady like you. Them feet-folks from York and
+
+Leeds that be always eatin� cured herrin�s an� drinkin� tea an� lookin�
+
+out to buy cheap jet would creed aught. I wonder masel� who�d be
+
+bothered tellin� lies to them--even the newspapers, which is full of
+
+fool-talk.� I thought he would be a good person to learn interesting
+
+things from, so I asked him if he would mind telling me something about
+
+the whale-fishing in the old days. He was just settling himself to begin
+
+when the clock struck six, whereupon he laboured to get up, and said:--
+
+�I must gang ageeanwards home now, miss. My grand-daughter doesn�t like
+
+to be kept waitin� when the tea is ready, for it takes me time to
+
+crammle aboon the grees, for there be a many of �em; an�, miss, I lack
+
+belly-timber sairly by the clock.�
+
+He hobbled away, and I could see him hurrying, as well as he could, down
+
+the steps. The steps are a great feature on the place. They lead from
+
+the town up to the church, there are hundreds of them--I do not know how
+
+many--and they wind up in a delicate curve; the slope is so gentle that
+
+a horse could easily walk up and down them. I think they must originally
+
+have had something to do with the abbey. I shall go home too. Lucy went
+
+out visiting with her mother, and as they were only duty calls, I did
+
+not go. They will be home by this.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_1 August._--I came up here an hour ago with Lucy, and we had a most
+
+interesting talk with my old friend and the two others who always come
+
+and join him. He is evidently the Sir Oracle of them, and I should think
+
+must have been in his time a most dictatorial person. He will not admit
+
+anything, and downfaces everybody. If he can�t out-argue them he bullies
+
+them, and then takes their silence for agreement with his views. Lucy
+
+was looking sweetly pretty in her white lawn frock; she has got a
+
+beautiful colour since she has been here. I noticed that the old men did
+
+not lose any time in coming up and sitting near her when we sat down.
+
+She is so sweet with old people; I think they all fell in love with her
+
+on the spot. Even my old man succumbed and did not contradict her, but
+
+gave me double share instead. I got him on the subject of the legends,
+
+and he went off at once into a sort of sermon. I must try to remember it
+
+and put it down:--
+
+�It be all fool-talk, lock, stock, and barrel; that�s what it be, an�
+
+nowt else. These bans an� wafts an� boh-ghosts an� barguests an� bogles
+
+an� all anent them is only fit to set bairns an� dizzy women
+
+a-belderin�. They be nowt but air-blebs. They, an� all grims an� signs
+
+an� warnin�s, be all invented by parsons an� illsome beuk-bodies an�
+
+railway touters to skeer an� scunner hafflin�s, an� to get folks to do
+
+somethin� that they don�t other incline to. It makes me ireful to think
+
+o� them. Why, it�s them that, not content with printin� lies on paper
+
+an� preachin� them out of pulpits, does want to be cuttin� them on the
+
+tombstones. Look here all around you in what airt ye will; all them
+
+steans, holdin� up their heads as well as they can out of their pride,
+
+is acant--simply tumblin� down with the weight o� the lies wrote on
+
+them, �Here lies the body� or �Sacred to the memory� wrote on all of
+
+them, an� yet in nigh half of them there bean�t no bodies at all; an�
+
+the memories of them bean�t cared a pinch of snuff about, much less
+
+sacred. Lies all of them, nothin� but lies of one kind or another! My
+
+gog, but it�ll be a quare scowderment at the Day of Judgment when they
+
+come tumblin� up in their death-sarks, all jouped together an� tryin� to
+
+drag their tombsteans with them to prove how good they was; some of them
+
+trimmlin� and ditherin�, with their hands that dozzened an� slippy from
+
+lyin� in the sea that they can�t even keep their grup o� them.�
+
+I could see from the old fellow�s self-satisfied air and the way in
+
+which he looked round for the approval of his cronies that he was
+
+�showing off,� so I put in a word to keep him going:--
+
+�Oh, Mr. Swales, you can�t be serious. Surely these tombstones are not
+
+all wrong?�
+
+�Yabblins! There may be a poorish few not wrong, savin� where they make
+
+out the people too good; for there be folk that do think a balm-bowl be
+
+like the sea, if only it be their own. The whole thing be only lies. Now
+
+look you here; you come here a stranger, an� you see this kirk-garth.� I
+
+nodded, for I thought it better to assent, though I did not quite
+
+understand his dialect. I knew it had something to do with the church.
+
+He went on: �And you consate that all these steans be aboon folk that be
+
+happed here, snod an� snog?� I assented again. �Then that be just where
+
+the lie comes in. Why, there be scores of these lay-beds that be toom as
+
+old Dun�s �bacca-box on Friday night.� He nudged one of his companions,
+
+and they all laughed. �And my gog! how could they be otherwise? Look at
+
+that one, the aftest abaft the bier-bank: read it!� I went over and
+
+read:--
+
+�Edward Spencelagh, master mariner, murdered by pirates off the coast of
+
+Andres, April, 1854, �t. 30.� When I came back Mr. Swales went on:--
+
+�Who brought him home, I wonder, to hap him here? Murdered off the coast
+
+of Andres! an� you consated his body lay under! Why, I could name ye a
+
+dozen whose bones lie in the Greenland seas above�--he pointed
+
+northwards--�or where the currents may have drifted them. There be the
+
+steans around ye. Ye can, with your young eyes, read the small-print of
+
+the lies from here. This Braithwaite Lowrey--I knew his father, lost in
+
+the _Lively_ off Greenland in �20; or Andrew Woodhouse, drowned in the
+
+same seas in 1777; or John Paxton, drowned off Cape Farewell a year
+
+later; or old John Rawlings, whose grandfather sailed with me, drowned
+
+in the Gulf of Finland in �50. Do ye think that all these men will have
+
+to make a rush to Whitby when the trumpet sounds? I have me antherums
+
+aboot it! I tell ye that when they got here they�d be jommlin� an�
+
+jostlin� one another that way that it �ud be like a fight up on the ice
+
+in the old days, when we�d be at one another from daylight to dark, an�
+
+tryin� to tie up our cuts by the light of the aurora borealis.� This was
+
+evidently local pleasantry, for the old man cackled over it, and his
+
+cronies joined in with gusto.
+
+�But,� I said, �surely you are not quite correct, for you start on the
+
+assumption that all the poor people, or their spirits, will have to
+
+take their tombstones with them on the Day of Judgment. Do you think
+
+that will be really necessary?�
+
+�Well, what else be they tombstones for? Answer me that, miss!�
+
+�To please their relatives, I suppose.�
+
+�To please their relatives, you suppose!� This he said with intense
+
+scorn. �How will it pleasure their relatives to know that lies is wrote
+
+over them, and that everybody in the place knows that they be lies?� He
+
+pointed to a stone at our feet which had been laid down as a slab, on
+
+which the seat was rested, close to the edge of the cliff. �Read the
+
+lies on that thruff-stean,� he said. The letters were upside down to me
+
+from where I sat, but Lucy was more opposite to them, so she leant over
+
+and read:--
+
+�Sacred to the memory of George Canon, who died, in the hope of a
+
+glorious resurrection, on July, 29, 1873, falling from the rocks at
+
+Kettleness. This tomb was erected by his sorrowing mother to her dearly
+
+beloved son. �He was the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.�
+
+Really, Mr. Swales, I don�t see anything very funny in that!� She spoke
+
+her comment very gravely and somewhat severely.
+
+�Ye don�t see aught funny! Ha! ha! But that�s because ye don�t gawm the
+
+sorrowin� mother was a hell-cat that hated him because he was
+
+acrewk�d--a regular lamiter he was--an� he hated her so that he
+
+committed suicide in order that she mightn�t get an insurance she put on
+
+his life. He blew nigh the top of his head off with an old musket that
+
+they had for scarin� the crows with. �Twarn�t for crows then, for it
+
+brought the clegs and the dowps to him. That�s the way he fell off the
+
+rocks. And, as to hopes of a glorious resurrection, I�ve often heard him
+
+say masel� that he hoped he�d go to hell, for his mother was so pious
+
+that she�d be sure to go to heaven, an� he didn�t want to addle where
+
+she was. Now isn�t that stean at any rate�--he hammered it with his
+
+stick as he spoke--�a pack of lies? and won�t it make Gabriel keckle
+
+when Geordie comes pantin� up the grees with the tombstean balanced on
+
+his hump, and asks it to be took as evidence!�
+
+I did not know what to say, but Lucy turned the conversation as she
+
+said, rising up:--
+
+�Oh, why did you tell us of this? It is my favourite seat, and I cannot
+
+leave it; and now I find I must go on sitting over the grave of a
+
+suicide.�
+
+�That won�t harm ye, my pretty; an� it may make poor Geordie gladsome to
+
+have so trim a lass sittin� on his lap. That won�t hurt ye. Why, I�ve
+
+sat here off an� on for nigh twenty years past, an� it hasn�t done me
+
+no harm. Don�t ye fash about them as lies under ye, or that doesn� lie
+
+there either! It�ll be time for ye to be getting scart when ye see the
+
+tombsteans all run away with, and the place as bare as a stubble-field.
+
+There�s the clock, an� I must gang. My service to ye, ladies!� And off
+
+he hobbled.
+
+Lucy and I sat awhile, and it was all so beautiful before us that we
+
+took hands as we sat; and she told me all over again about Arthur and
+
+their coming marriage. That made me just a little heart-sick, for I
+
+haven�t heard from Jonathan for a whole month.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_The same day._ I came up here alone, for I am very sad. There was no
+
+letter for me. I hope there cannot be anything the matter with Jonathan.
+
+The clock has just struck nine. I see the lights scattered all over the
+
+town, sometimes in rows where the streets are, and sometimes singly;
+
+they run right up the Esk and die away in the curve of the valley. To my
+
+left the view is cut off by a black line of roof of the old house next
+
+the abbey. The sheep and lambs are bleating in the fields away behind
+
+me, and there is a clatter of a donkey�s hoofs up the paved road below.
+
+The band on the pier is playing a harsh waltz in good time, and further
+
+along the quay there is a Salvation Army meeting in a back street.
+
+Neither of the bands hears the other, but up here I hear and see them
+
+both. I wonder where Jonathan is and if he is thinking of me! I wish he
+
+were here.
+
+_Dr. Seward�s Diary._
+
+_5 June._--The case of Renfield grows more interesting the more I get to
+
+understand the man. He has certain qualities very largely developed;
+
+selfishness, secrecy, and purpose. I wish I could get at what is the
+
+object of the latter. He seems to have some settled scheme of his own,
+
+but what it is I do not yet know. His redeeming quality is a love of
+
+animals, though, indeed, he has such curious turns in it that I
+
+sometimes imagine he is only abnormally cruel. His pets are of odd
+
+sorts. Just now his hobby is catching flies. He has at present such a
+
+quantity that I have had myself to expostulate. To my astonishment, he
+
+did not break out into a fury, as I expected, but took the matter in
+
+simple seriousness. He thought for a moment, and then said: �May I have
+
+three days? I shall clear them away.� Of course, I said that would do. I
+
+must watch him.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_18 June._--He has turned his mind now to spiders, and has got several
+
+very big fellows in a box. He keeps feeding them with his flies, and
+
+the number of the latter is becoming sensibly diminished, although he
+
+has used half his food in attracting more flies from outside to his
+
+room.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_1 July._--His spiders are now becoming as great a nuisance as his
+
+flies, and to-day I told him that he must get rid of them. He looked
+
+very sad at this, so I said that he must clear out some of them, at all
+
+events. He cheerfully acquiesced in this, and I gave him the same time
+
+as before for reduction. He disgusted me much while with him, for when a
+
+horrid blow-fly, bloated with some carrion food, buzzed into the room,
+
+he caught it, held it exultantly for a few moments between his finger
+
+and thumb, and, before I knew what he was going to do, put it in his
+
+mouth and ate it. I scolded him for it, but he argued quietly that it
+
+was very good and very wholesome; that it was life, strong life, and
+
+gave life to him. This gave me an idea, or the rudiment of one. I must
+
+watch how he gets rid of his spiders. He has evidently some deep problem
+
+in his mind, for he keeps a little note-book in which he is always
+
+jotting down something. Whole pages of it are filled with masses of
+
+figures, generally single numbers added up in batches, and then the
+
+totals added in batches again, as though he were �focussing� some
+
+account, as the auditors put it.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_8 July._--There is a method in his madness, and the rudimentary idea in
+
+my mind is growing. It will be a whole idea soon, and then, oh,
+
+unconscious cerebration! you will have to give the wall to your
+
+conscious brother. I kept away from my friend for a few days, so that I
+
+might notice if there were any change. Things remain as they were except
+
+that he has parted with some of his pets and got a new one. He has
+
+managed to get a sparrow, and has already partially tamed it. His means
+
+of taming is simple, for already the spiders have diminished. Those that
+
+do remain, however, are well fed, for he still brings in the flies by
+
+tempting them with his food.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_19 July._--We are progressing. My friend has now a whole colony of
+
+sparrows, and his flies and spiders are almost obliterated. When I came
+
+in he ran to me and said he wanted to ask me a great favour--a very,
+
+very great favour; and as he spoke he fawned on me like a dog. I asked
+
+him what it was, and he said, with a sort of rapture in his voice and
+
+bearing:--
+
+�A kitten, a nice little, sleek playful kitten, that I can play with,
+
+and teach, and feed--and feed--and feed!� I was not unprepared for this
+
+request, for I had noticed how his pets went on increasing in size and
+
+vivacity, but I did not care that his pretty family of tame sparrows
+
+should be wiped out in the same manner as the flies and the spiders; so
+
+I said I would see about it, and asked him if he would not rather have a
+
+cat than a kitten. His eagerness betrayed him as he answered:--
+
+�Oh, yes, I would like a cat! I only asked for a kitten lest you should
+
+refuse me a cat. No one would refuse me a kitten, would they?� I shook
+
+my head, and said that at present I feared it would not be possible, but
+
+that I would see about it. His face fell, and I could see a warning of
+
+danger in it, for there was a sudden fierce, sidelong look which meant
+
+killing. The man is an undeveloped homicidal maniac. I shall test him
+
+with his present craving and see how it will work out; then I shall know
+
+more.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_10 p. m._--I have visited him again and found him sitting in a corner
+
+brooding. When I came in he threw himself on his knees before me and
+
+implored me to let him have a cat; that his salvation depended upon it.
+
+I was firm, however, and told him that he could not have it, whereupon
+
+he went without a word, and sat down, gnawing his fingers, in the corner
+
+where I had found him. I shall see him in the morning early.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_20 July._--Visited Renfield very early, before the attendant went his
+
+rounds. Found him up and humming a tune. He was spreading out his sugar,
+
+which he had saved, in the window, and was manifestly beginning his
+
+fly-catching again; and beginning it cheerfully and with a good grace. I
+
+looked around for his birds, and not seeing them, asked him where they
+
+were. He replied, without turning round, that they had all flown away.
+
+There were a few feathers about the room and on his pillow a drop of
+
+blood. I said nothing, but went and told the keeper to report to me if
+
+there were anything odd about him during the day.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_11 a. m._--The attendant has just been to me to say that Renfield has
+
+been very sick and has disgorged a whole lot of feathers. �My belief is,
+
+doctor,� he said, �that he has eaten his birds, and that he just took
+
+and ate them raw!�
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_11 p. m._--I gave Renfield a strong opiate to-night, enough to make
+
+even him sleep, and took away his pocket-book to look at it. The thought
+
+that has been buzzing about my brain lately is complete, and the theory
+
+proved. My homicidal maniac is of a peculiar kind. I shall have to
+
+invent a new classification for him, and call him a zo�phagous
+
+(life-eating) maniac; what he desires is to absorb as many lives as he
+
+can, and he has laid himself out to achieve it in a cumulative way. He
+
+gave many flies to one spider and many spiders to one bird, and then
+
+wanted a cat to eat the many birds. What would have been his later
+
+steps? It would almost be worth while to complete the experiment. It
+
+might be done if there were only a sufficient cause. Men sneered at
+
+vivisection, and yet look at its results to-day! Why not advance science
+
+in its most difficult and vital aspect--the knowledge of the brain? Had
+
+I even the secret of one such mind--did I hold the key to the fancy of
+
+even one lunatic--I might advance my own branch of science to a pitch
+
+compared with which Burdon-Sanderson�s physiology or Ferrier�s
+
+brain-knowledge would be as nothing. If only there were a sufficient
+
+cause! I must not think too much of this, or I may be tempted; a good
+
+cause might turn the scale with me, for may not I too be of an
+
+exceptional brain, congenitally?
+
+How well the man reasoned; lunatics always do within their own scope. I
+
+wonder at how many lives he values a man, or if at only one. He has
+
+closed the account most accurately, and to-day begun a new record. How
+
+many of us begin a new record with each day of our lives?
+
+To me it seems only yesterday that my whole life ended with my new hope,
+
+and that truly I began a new record. So it will be until the Great
+
+Recorder sums me up and closes my ledger account with a balance to
+
+profit or loss. Oh, Lucy, Lucy, I cannot be angry with you, nor can I be
+
+angry with my friend whose happiness is yours; but I must only wait on
+
+hopeless and work. Work! work!
+
+If I only could have as strong a cause as my poor mad friend there--a
+
+good, unselfish cause to make me work--that would be indeed happiness.
+
+_Mina Murray�s Journal._
+
+_26 July._--I am anxious, and it soothes me to express myself here; it
+
+is like whispering to one�s self and listening at the same time. And
+
+there is also something about the shorthand symbols that makes it
+
+different from writing. I am unhappy about Lucy and about Jonathan. I
+
+had not heard from Jonathan for some time, and was very concerned; but
+
+yesterday dear Mr. Hawkins, who is always so kind, sent me a letter from
+
+him. I had written asking him if he had heard, and he said the enclosed
+
+had just been received. It is only a line dated from Castle Dracula,
+
+and says that he is just starting for home. That is not like Jonathan;
+
+I do not understand it, and it makes me uneasy. Then, too, Lucy,
+
+although she is so well, has lately taken to her old habit of walking in
+
+her sleep. Her mother has spoken to me about it, and we have decided
+
+that I am to lock the door of our room every night. Mrs. Westenra has
+
+got an idea that sleep-walkers always go out on roofs of houses and
+
+along the edges of cliffs and then get suddenly wakened and fall over
+
+with a despairing cry that echoes all over the place. Poor dear, she is
+
+naturally anxious about Lucy, and she tells me that her husband, Lucy�s
+
+father, had the same habit; that he would get up in the night and dress
+
+himself and go out, if he were not stopped. Lucy is to be married in the
+
+autumn, and she is already planning out her dresses and how her house is
+
+to be arranged. I sympathise with her, for I do the same, only Jonathan
+
+and I will start in life in a very simple way, and shall have to try to
+
+make both ends meet. Mr. Holmwood--he is the Hon. Arthur Holmwood, only
+
+son of Lord Godalming--is coming up here very shortly--as soon as he can
+
+leave town, for his father is not very well, and I think dear Lucy is
+
+counting the moments till he comes. She wants to take him up to the seat
+
+on the churchyard cliff and show him the beauty of Whitby. I daresay it
+
+is the waiting which disturbs her; she will be all right when he
+
+arrives.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_27 July._--No news from Jonathan. I am getting quite uneasy about him,
+
+though why I should I do not know; but I do wish that he would write, if
+
+it were only a single line. Lucy walks more than ever, and each night I
+
+am awakened by her moving about the room. Fortunately, the weather is so
+
+hot that she cannot get cold; but still the anxiety and the perpetually
+
+being wakened is beginning to tell on me, and I am getting nervous and
+
+wakeful myself. Thank God, Lucy�s health keeps up. Mr. Holmwood has been
+
+suddenly called to Ring to see his father, who has been taken seriously
+
+ill. Lucy frets at the postponement of seeing him, but it does not touch
+
+her looks; she is a trifle stouter, and her cheeks are a lovely
+
+rose-pink. She has lost that an�mic look which she had. I pray it will
+
+all last.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_3 August._--Another week gone, and no news from Jonathan, not even to
+
+Mr. Hawkins, from whom I have heard. Oh, I do hope he is not ill. He
+
+surely would have written. I look at that last letter of his, but
+
+somehow it does not satisfy me. It does not read like him, and yet it is
+
+his writing. There is no mistake of that. Lucy has not walked much in
+
+her sleep the last week, but there is an odd concentration about her
+
+which I do not understand; even in her sleep she seems to be watching
+
+me. She tries the door, and finding it locked, goes about the room
+
+searching for the key.
+
+_6 August._--Another three days, and no news. This suspense is getting
+
+dreadful. If I only knew where to write to or where to go to, I should
+
+feel easier; but no one has heard a word of Jonathan since that last
+
+letter. I must only pray to God for patience. Lucy is more excitable
+
+than ever, but is otherwise well. Last night was very threatening, and
+
+the fishermen say that we are in for a storm. I must try to watch it and
+
+learn the weather signs. To-day is a grey day, and the sun as I write is
+
+hidden in thick clouds, high over Kettleness. Everything is grey--except
+
+the green grass, which seems like emerald amongst it; grey earthy rock;
+
+grey clouds, tinged with the sunburst at the far edge, hang over the
+
+grey sea, into which the sand-points stretch like grey fingers. The sea
+
+is tumbling in over the shallows and the sandy flats with a roar,
+
+muffled in the sea-mists drifting inland. The horizon is lost in a grey
+
+mist. All is vastness; the clouds are piled up like giant rocks, and
+
+there is a �brool� over the sea that sounds like some presage of doom.
+
+Dark figures are on the beach here and there, sometimes half shrouded in
+
+the mist, and seem �men like trees walking.� The fishing-boats are
+
+racing for home, and rise and dip in the ground swell as they sweep into
+
+the harbour, bending to the scuppers. Here comes old Mr. Swales. He is
+
+making straight for me, and I can see, by the way he lifts his hat, that
+
+he wants to talk....
+
+I have been quite touched by the change in the poor old man. When he sat
+
+down beside me, he said in a very gentle way:--
+
+�I want to say something to you, miss.� I could see he was not at ease,
+
+so I took his poor old wrinkled hand in mine and asked him to speak
+
+fully; so he said, leaving his hand in mine:--
+
+�I�m afraid, my deary, that I must have shocked you by all the wicked
+
+things I�ve been sayin� about the dead, and such like, for weeks past;
+
+but I didn�t mean them, and I want ye to remember that when I�m gone. We
+
+aud folks that be daffled, and with one foot abaft the krok-hooal, don�t
+
+altogether like to think of it, and we don�t want to feel scart of it;
+
+an� that�s why I�ve took to makin� light of it, so that I�d cheer up my
+
+own heart a bit. But, Lord love ye, miss, I ain�t afraid of dyin�, not a
+
+bit; only I don�t want to die if I can help it. My time must be nigh at
+
+hand now, for I be aud, and a hundred years is too much for any man to
+
+expect; and I�m so nigh it that the Aud Man is already whettin� his
+
+scythe. Ye see, I can�t get out o� the habit of caffin� about it all at
+
+once; the chafts will wag as they be used to. Some day soon the Angel of
+
+Death will sound his trumpet for me. But don�t ye dooal an� greet, my
+
+deary!�--for he saw that I was crying--�if he should come this very
+
+night I�d not refuse to answer his call. For life be, after all, only a
+
+waitin� for somethin� else than what we�re doin�; and death be all that
+
+we can rightly depend on. But I�m content, for it�s comin� to me, my
+
+deary, and comin� quick. It may be comin� while we be lookin� and
+
+wonderin�. Maybe it�s in that wind out over the sea that�s bringin� with
+
+it loss and wreck, and sore distress, and sad hearts. Look! look!� he
+
+cried suddenly. �There�s something in that wind and in the hoast beyont
+
+that sounds, and looks, and tastes, and smells like death. It�s in the
+
+air; I feel it comin�. Lord, make me answer cheerful when my call
+
+comes!� He held up his arms devoutly, and raised his hat. His mouth
+
+moved as though he were praying. After a few minutes� silence, he got
+
+up, shook hands with me, and blessed me, and said good-bye, and hobbled
+
+off. It all touched me, and upset me very much.
+
+I was glad when the coastguard came along, with his spy-glass under his
+
+arm. He stopped to talk with me, as he always does, but all the time
+
+kept looking at a strange ship.
+
+�I can�t make her out,� he said; �she�s a Russian, by the look of her;
+
+but she�s knocking about in the queerest way. She doesn�t know her mind
+
+a bit; she seems to see the storm coming, but can�t decide whether to
+
+run up north in the open, or to put in here. Look there again! She is
+
+steered mighty strangely, for she doesn�t mind the hand on the wheel;
+
+changes about with every puff of wind. We�ll hear more of her before
+
+this time to-morrow.�

+Chapter SEARCH FOR MR. HYDE
+
+That evening Mr. Utterson came home to his bachelor house in sombre
+
+spirits and sat down to dinner without relish. It was his custom of a
+
+Sunday, when this meal was over, to sit close by the fire, a volume of
+
+some dry divinity on his reading desk, until the clock of the
+
+neighbouring church rang out the hour of twelve, when he would go
+
+soberly and gratefully to bed. On this night however, as soon as the
+
+cloth was taken away, he took up a candle and went into his business
+
+room. There he opened his safe, took from the most private part of it a
+
+document endorsed on the envelope as Dr. Jekyll�s Will and sat down
+
+with a clouded brow to study its contents. The will was holograph, for
+
+Mr. Utterson though he took charge of it now that it was made, had
+
+refused to lend the least assistance in the making of it; it provided
+
+not only that, in case of the decease of Henry Jekyll, M.D., D.C.L.,
+
+L.L.D., F.R.S., etc., all his possessions were to pass into the hands
+
+of his �friend and benefactor Edward Hyde,� but that in case of Dr.
+
+Jekyll�s �disappearance or unexplained absence for any period exceeding
+
+three calendar months,� the said Edward Hyde should step into the said
+
+Henry Jekyll�s shoes without further delay and free from any burthen or
+
+obligation beyond the payment of a few small sums to the members of the
+
+doctor�s household. This document had long been the lawyer�s eyesore.
+
+It offended him both as a lawyer and as a lover of the sane and
+
+customary sides of life, to whom the fanciful was the immodest. And
+
+hitherto it was his ignorance of Mr. Hyde that had swelled his
+
+indignation; now, by a sudden turn, it was his knowledge. It was
+
+already bad enough when the name was but a name of which he could learn
+
+no more. It was worse when it began to be clothed upon with detestable
+
+attributes; and out of the shifting, insubstantial mists that had so
+
+long baffled his eye, there leaped up the sudden, definite presentment
+
+of a fiend.
+
+�I thought it was madness,� he said, as he replaced the obnoxious paper
+
+in the safe, �and now I begin to fear it is disgrace.�
+
+With that he blew out his candle, put on a greatcoat, and set forth in
+
+the direction of Cavendish Square, that citadel of medicine, where his
+
+friend, the great Dr. Lanyon, had his house and received his crowding
+
+patients. �If anyone knows, it will be Lanyon,� he had thought.
+
+The solemn butler knew and welcomed him; he was subjected to no stage
+
+of delay, but ushered direct from the door to the dining-room where Dr.
+
+Lanyon sat alone over his wine. This was a hearty, healthy, dapper,
+
+red-faced gentleman, with a shock of hair prematurely white, and a
+
+boisterous and decided manner. At sight of Mr. Utterson, he sprang up
+
+from his chair and welcomed him with both hands. The geniality, as was
+
+the way of the man, was somewhat theatrical to the eye; but it reposed
+
+on genuine feeling. For these two were old friends, old mates both at
+
+school and college, both thorough respectors of themselves and of each
+
+other, and what does not always follow, men who thoroughly enjoyed each
+
+other�s company.
+
+After a little rambling talk, the lawyer led up to the subject which so
+
+disagreeably preoccupied his mind.
+
+�I suppose, Lanyon,� said he, �you and I must be the two oldest friends
+
+that Henry Jekyll has?�
+
+�I wish the friends were younger,� chuckled Dr. Lanyon. �But I suppose
+
+we are. And what of that? I see little of him now.�
+
+�Indeed?� said Utterson. �I thought you had a bond of common interest.�
+
+�We had,� was the reply. �But it is more than ten years since Henry
+
+Jekyll became too fanciful for me. He began to go wrong, wrong in mind;
+
+and though of course I continue to take an interest in him for old
+
+sake�s sake, as they say, I see and I have seen devilish little of the
+
+man. Such unscientific balderdash,� added the doctor, flushing suddenly
+
+purple, �would have estranged Damon and Pythias.�
+
+This little spirit of temper was somewhat of a relief to Mr. Utterson.
+
+�They have only differed on some point of science,� he thought; and
+
+being a man of no scientific passions (except in the matter of
+
+conveyancing), he even added: �It is nothing worse than that!� He gave
+
+his friend a few seconds to recover his composure, and then approached
+
+the question he had come to put. �Did you ever come across a _prot�g�_
+
+of his�one Hyde?� he asked.
+
+�Hyde?� repeated Lanyon. �No. Never heard of him. Since my time.�
+
+That was the amount of information that the lawyer carried back with
+
+him to the great, dark bed on which he tossed to and fro, until the
+
+small hours of the morning began to grow large. It was a night of
+
+little ease to his toiling mind, toiling in mere darkness and besieged
+
+by questions.
+
+Six o�clock struck on the bells of the church that was so conveniently
+
+near to Mr. Utterson�s dwelling, and still he was digging at the
+
+problem. Hitherto it had touched him on the intellectual side alone;
+
+but now his imagination also was engaged, or rather enslaved; and as he
+
+lay and tossed in the gross darkness of the night and the curtained
+
+room, Mr. Enfield�s tale went by before his mind in a scroll of lighted
+
+pictures. He would be aware of the great field of lamps of a nocturnal
+
+city; then of the figure of a man walking swiftly; then of a child
+
+running from the doctor�s; and then these met, and that human
+
+Juggernaut trod the child down and passed on regardless of her screams.
+
+Or else he would see a room in a rich house, where his friend lay
+
+asleep, dreaming and smiling at his dreams; and then the door of that
+
+room would be opened, the curtains of the bed plucked apart, the
+
+sleeper recalled, and lo! there would stand by his side a figure to
+
+whom power was given, and even at that dead hour, he must rise and do
+
+its bidding. The figure in these two phases haunted the lawyer all
+
+night; and if at any time he dozed over, it was but to see it glide
+
+more stealthily through sleeping houses, or move the more swiftly and
+
+still the more swiftly, even to dizziness, through wider labyrinths of
+
+lamplighted city, and at every street corner crush a child and leave
+
+her screaming. And still the figure had no face by which he might know
+
+it; even in his dreams, it had no face, or one that baffled him and
+
+melted before his eyes; and thus it was that there sprang up and grew
+
+apace in the lawyer�s mind a singularly strong, almost an inordinate,
+
+curiosity to behold the features of the real Mr. Hyde. If he could but
+
+once set eyes on him, he thought the mystery would lighten and perhaps
+
+roll altogether away, as was the habit of mysterious things when well
+
+examined. He might see a reason for his friend�s strange preference or
+
+bondage (call it which you please) and even for the startling clause of
+
+the will. At least it would be a face worth seeing: the face of a man
+
+who was without bowels of mercy: a face which had but to show itself to
+
+raise up, in the mind of the unimpressionable Enfield, a spirit of
+
+enduring hatred.
+
+From that time forward, Mr. Utterson began to haunt the door in the
+
+by-street of shops. In the morning before office hours, at noon when
+
+business was plenty and time scarce, at night under the face of the
+
+fogged city moon, by all lights and at all hours of solitude or
+
+concourse, the lawyer was to be found on his chosen post.
+
+�If he be Mr. Hyde,� he had thought, �I shall be Mr. Seek.�
+
+And at last his patience was rewarded. It was a fine dry night; frost
+
+in the air; the streets as clean as a ballroom floor; the lamps,
+
+unshaken by any wind, drawing a regular pattern of light and shadow. By
+
+ten o�clock, when the shops were closed, the by-street was very
+
+solitary and, in spite of the low growl of London from all round, very
+
+silent. Small sounds carried far; domestic sounds out of the houses
+
+were clearly audible on either side of the roadway; and the rumour of
+
+the approach of any passenger preceded him by a long time. Mr. Utterson
+
+had been some minutes at his post, when he was aware of an odd light
+
+footstep drawing near. In the course of his nightly patrols, he had
+
+long grown accustomed to the quaint effect with which the footfalls of
+
+a single person, while he is still a great way off, suddenly spring out
+
+distinct from the vast hum and clatter of the city. Yet his attention
+
+had never before been so sharply and decisively arrested; and it was
+
+with a strong, superstitious prevision of success that he withdrew into
+
+the entry of the court.
+
+The steps drew swiftly nearer, and swelled out suddenly louder as they
+
+turned the end of the street. The lawyer, looking forth from the entry,
+
+could soon see what manner of man he had to deal with. He was small and
+
+very plainly dressed and the look of him, even at that distance, went
+
+somehow strongly against the watcher�s inclination. But he made
+
+straight for the door, crossing the roadway to save time; and as he
+
+came, he drew a key from his pocket like one approaching home.
+
+Mr. Utterson stepped out and touched him on the shoulder as he passed.
+
+�Mr. Hyde, I think?�
+
+Mr. Hyde shrank back with a hissing intake of the breath. But his fear
+
+was only momentary; and though he did not look the lawyer in the face,
+
+he answered coolly enough: �That is my name. What do you want?�
+
+�I see you are going in,� returned the lawyer. �I am an old friend of
+
+Dr. Jekyll�s�Mr. Utterson of Gaunt Street�you must have heard of my
+
+name; and meeting you so conveniently, I thought you might admit me.�
+
+�You will not find Dr. Jekyll; he is from home,� replied Mr. Hyde,
+
+blowing in the key. And then suddenly, but still without looking up,
+
+�How did you know me?� he asked.
+
+�On your side,� said Mr. Utterson �will you do me a favour?�
+
+�With pleasure,� replied the other. �What shall it be?�
+
+�Will you let me see your face?� asked the lawyer.
+
+Mr. Hyde appeared to hesitate, and then, as if upon some sudden
+
+reflection, fronted about with an air of defiance; and the pair stared
+
+at each other pretty fixedly for a few seconds. �Now I shall know you
+
+again,� said Mr. Utterson. �It may be useful.�
+
+�Yes,� returned Mr. Hyde, �It is as well we have met; and _� propos_,
+
+you should have my address.� And he gave a number of a street in Soho.
+
+�Good God!� thought Mr. Utterson, �can he, too, have been thinking of
+
+the will?� But he kept his feelings to himself and only grunted in
+
+acknowledgment of the address.
+
+�And now,� said the other, �how did you know me?�
+
+�By description,� was the reply.
+
+�Whose description?�
+
+�We have common friends,� said Mr. Utterson.
+
+�Common friends,� echoed Mr. Hyde, a little hoarsely. �Who are they?�
+
+�Jekyll, for instance,� said the lawyer.
+
+�He never told you,� cried Mr. Hyde, with a flush of anger. �I did not
+
+think you would have lied.�
+
+�Come,� said Mr. Utterson, �that is not fitting language.�
+
+The other snarled aloud into a savage laugh; and the next moment, with
+
+extraordinary quickness, he had unlocked the door and disappeared into
+
+the house.
+
+The lawyer stood awhile when Mr. Hyde had left him, the picture of
+
+disquietude. Then he began slowly to mount the street, pausing every
+
+step or two and putting his hand to his brow like a man in mental
+
+perplexity. The problem he was thus debating as he walked, was one of a
+
+class that is rarely solved. Mr. Hyde was pale and dwarfish, he gave an
+
+impression of deformity without any nameable malformation, he had a
+
+displeasing smile, he had borne himself to the lawyer with a sort of
+
+murderous mixture of timidity and boldness, and he spoke with a husky,
+
+whispering and somewhat broken voice; all these were points against
+
+him, but not all of these together could explain the hitherto unknown
+
+disgust, loathing and fear with which Mr. Utterson regarded him. �There
+
+must be something else,� said the perplexed gentleman. �There _is_
+
+something more, if I could find a name for it. God bless me, the man
+
+seems hardly human! Something troglodytic, shall we say? or can it be
+
+the old story of Dr. Fell? or is it the mere radiance of a foul soul
+
+that thus transpires through, and transfigures, its clay continent? The
+
+last, I think; for, O my poor old Harry Jekyll, if ever I read Satan�s
+
+signature upon a face, it is on that of your new friend.�
+
+Round the corner from the by-street, there was a square of ancient,
+
+handsome houses, now for the most part decayed from their high estate
+
+and let in flats and chambers to all sorts and conditions of men;
+
+map-engravers, architects, shady lawyers and the agents of obscure
+
+enterprises. One house, however, second from the corner, was still
+
+occupied entire; and at the door of this, which wore a great air of
+
+wealth and comfort, though it was now plunged in darkness except for
+
+the fanlight, Mr. Utterson stopped and knocked. A well-dressed, elderly
+
+servant opened the door.
+
+�Is Dr. Jekyll at home, Poole?� asked the lawyer.
+
+�I will see, Mr. Utterson,� said Poole, admitting the visitor, as he
+
+spoke, into a large, low-roofed, comfortable hall paved with flags,
+
+warmed (after the fashion of a country house) by a bright, open fire,
+
+and furnished with costly cabinets of oak. �Will you wait here by the
+
+fire, sir? or shall I give you a light in the dining-room?�
+
+�Here, thank you,� said the lawyer, and he drew near and leaned on the
+
+tall fender. This hall, in which he was now left alone, was a pet fancy
+
+of his friend the doctor�s; and Utterson himself was wont to speak of
+
+it as the pleasantest room in London. But tonight there was a shudder
+
+in his blood; the face of Hyde sat heavy on his memory; he felt (what
+
+was rare with him) a nausea and distaste of life; and in the gloom of
+
+his spirits, he seemed to read a menace in the flickering of the
+
+firelight on the polished cabinets and the uneasy starting of the
+
+shadow on the roof. He was ashamed of his relief, when Poole presently
+
+returned to announce that Dr. Jekyll was gone out.
+
+�I saw Mr. Hyde go in by the old dissecting room, Poole,� he said. �Is
+
+that right, when Dr. Jekyll is from home?�
+
+�Quite right, Mr. Utterson, sir,� replied the servant. �Mr. Hyde has a
+
+key.�
+
+�Your master seems to repose a great deal of trust in that young man,
+
+Poole,� resumed the other musingly.
+
+�Yes, sir, he does indeed,� said Poole. �We have all orders to obey
+
+him.�
+
+�I do not think I ever met Mr. Hyde?� asked Utterson.
+
+�O, dear no, sir. He never _dines_ here,� replied the butler. �Indeed
+
+we see very little of him on this side of the house; he mostly comes
+
+and goes by the laboratory.�
+
+�Well, good-night, Poole.�
+
+�Good-night, Mr. Utterson.�
+
+And the lawyer set out homeward with a very heavy heart. �Poor Harry
+
+Jekyll,� he thought, �my mind misgives me he is in deep waters! He was
+
+wild when he was young; a long while ago to be sure; but in the law of
+
+God, there is no statute of limitations. Ay, it must be that; the ghost
+
+of some old sin, the cancer of some concealed disgrace: punishment
+
+coming, _pede claudo_, years after memory has forgotten and self-love
+
+condoned the fault.� And the lawyer, scared by the thought, brooded
+
+awhile on his own past, groping in all the corners of memory, least by
+
+chance some Jack-in-the-Box of an old iniquity should leap to light
+
+there. His past was fairly blameless; few men could read the rolls of
+
+their life with less apprehension; yet he was humbled to the dust by
+
+the many ill things he had done, and raised up again into a sober and
+
+fearful gratitude by the many he had come so near to doing yet avoided.
+
+And then by a return on his former subject, he conceived a spark of
+
+hope. �This Master Hyde, if he were studied,� thought he, �must have
+
+secrets of his own; black secrets, by the look of him; secrets compared
+
+to which poor Jekyll�s worst would be like sunshine. Things cannot
+
+continue as they are. It turns me cold to think of this creature
+
+stealing like a thief to Harry�s bedside; poor Harry, what a wakening!
+
+And the danger of it; for if this Hyde suspects the existence of the
+
+will, he may grow impatient to inherit. Ay, I must put my shoulders to
+
+the wheel�if Jekyll will but let me,� he added, �if Jekyll will only
+
+let me.� For once more he saw before his mind�s eye, as clear as
+
+transparency, the strange clauses of the will.

+CHAPTER XXII
+
+JONATHAN HARKER�S JOURNAL
+
+_3 October._--As I must do something or go mad, I write this diary. It
+
+is now six o�clock, and we are to meet in the study in half an hour and
+
+take something to eat; for Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward are agreed
+
+that if we do not eat we cannot work our best. Our best will be, God
+
+knows, required to-day. I must keep writing at every chance, for I dare
+
+not stop to think. All, big and little, must go down; perhaps at the end
+
+the little things may teach us most. The teaching, big or little, could
+
+not have landed Mina or me anywhere worse than we are to-day. However,
+
+we must trust and hope. Poor Mina told me just now, with the tears
+
+running down her dear cheeks, that it is in trouble and trial that our
+
+faith is tested--that we must keep on trusting; and that God will aid us
+
+up to the end. The end! oh my God! what end?... To work! To work!
+
+When Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward had come back from seeing poor
+
+Renfield, we went gravely into what was to be done. First, Dr. Seward
+
+told us that when he and Dr. Van Helsing had gone down to the room below
+
+they had found Renfield lying on the floor, all in a heap. His face was
+
+all bruised and crushed in, and the bones of the neck were broken.
+
+Dr. Seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if he had
+
+heard anything. He said that he had been sitting down--he confessed to
+
+half dozing--when he heard loud voices in the room, and then Renfield
+
+had called out loudly several times, �God! God! God!� after that there
+
+was a sound of falling, and when he entered the room he found him lying
+
+on the floor, face down, just as the doctors had seen him. Van Helsing
+
+asked if he had heard �voices� or �a voice,� and he said he could not
+
+say; that at first it had seemed to him as if there were two, but as
+
+there was no one in the room it could have been only one. He could swear
+
+to it, if required, that the word �God� was spoken by the patient. Dr.
+
+Seward said to us, when we were alone, that he did not wish to go into
+
+the matter; the question of an inquest had to be considered, and it
+
+would never do to put forward the truth, as no one would believe it. As
+
+it was, he thought that on the attendant�s evidence he could give a
+
+certificate of death by misadventure in falling from bed. In case the
+
+coroner should demand it, there would be a formal inquest, necessarily
+
+to the same result.
+
+When the question began to be discussed as to what should be our next
+
+step, the very first thing we decided was that Mina should be in full
+
+confidence; that nothing of any sort--no matter how painful--should be
+
+kept from her. She herself agreed as to its wisdom, and it was pitiful
+
+to see her so brave and yet so sorrowful, and in such a depth of
+
+despair. �There must be no concealment,� she said, �Alas! we have had
+
+too much already. And besides there is nothing in all the world that can
+
+give me more pain than I have already endured--than I suffer now!
+
+Whatever may happen, it must be of new hope or of new courage to me!�
+
+Van Helsing was looking at her fixedly as she spoke, and said, suddenly
+
+but quietly:--
+
+�But dear Madam Mina, are you not afraid; not for yourself, but for
+
+others from yourself, after what has happened?� Her face grew set in its
+
+lines, but her eyes shone with the devotion of a martyr as she
+
+answered:--
+
+�Ah no! for my mind is made up!�
+
+�To what?� he asked gently, whilst we were all very still; for each in
+
+our own way we had a sort of vague idea of what she meant. Her answer
+
+came with direct simplicity, as though she were simply stating a fact:--
+
+�Because if I find in myself--and I shall watch keenly for it--a sign of
+
+harm to any that I love, I shall die!�
+
+�You would not kill yourself?� he asked, hoarsely.
+
+�I would; if there were no friend who loved me, who would save me such a
+
+pain, and so desperate an effort!� She looked at him meaningly as she
+
+spoke. He was sitting down; but now he rose and came close to her and
+
+put his hand on her head as he said solemnly:
+
+�My child, there is such an one if it were for your good. For myself I
+
+could hold it in my account with God to find such an euthanasia for you,
+
+even at this moment if it were best. Nay, were it safe! But my
+
+child----� For a moment he seemed choked, and a great sob rose in his
+
+throat; he gulped it down and went on:--
+
+�There are here some who would stand between you and death. You must not
+
+die. You must not die by any hand; but least of all by your own. Until
+
+the other, who has fouled your sweet life, is true dead you must not
+
+die; for if he is still with the quick Un-Dead, your death would make
+
+you even as he is. No, you must live! You must struggle and strive to
+
+live, though death would seem a boon unspeakable. You must fight Death
+
+himself, though he come to you in pain or in joy; by the day, or the
+
+night; in safety or in peril! On your living soul I charge you that you
+
+do not die--nay, nor think of death--till this great evil be past.� The
+
+poor dear grew white as death, and shock and shivered, as I have seen a
+
+quicksand shake and shiver at the incoming of the tide. We were all
+
+silent; we could do nothing. At length she grew more calm and turning to
+
+him said, sweetly, but oh! so sorrowfully, as she held out her hand:--
+
+�I promise you, my dear friend, that if God will let me live, I shall
+
+strive to do so; till, if it may be in His good time, this horror may
+
+have passed away from me.� She was so good and brave that we all felt
+
+that our hearts were strengthened to work and endure for her, and we
+
+began to discuss what we were to do. I told her that she was to have all
+
+the papers in the safe, and all the papers or diaries and phonographs we
+
+might hereafter use; and was to keep the record as she had done before.
+
+She was pleased with the prospect of anything to do--if �pleased� could
+
+be used in connection with so grim an interest.
+
+As usual Van Helsing had thought ahead of everyone else, and was
+
+prepared with an exact ordering of our work.
+
+�It is perhaps well,� he said, �that at our meeting after our visit to
+
+Carfax we decided not to do anything with the earth-boxes that lay
+
+there. Had we done so, the Count must have guessed our purpose, and
+
+would doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate such an
+
+effort with regard to the others; but now he does not know our
+
+intentions. Nay, more, in all probability, he does not know that such a
+
+power exists to us as can sterilise his lairs, so that he cannot use
+
+them as of old. We are now so much further advanced in our knowledge as
+
+to their disposition that, when we have examined the house in
+
+Piccadilly, we may track the very last of them. To-day, then, is ours;
+
+and in it rests our hope. The sun that rose on our sorrow this morning
+
+guards us in its course. Until it sets to-night, that monster must
+
+retain whatever form he now has. He is confined within the limitations
+
+of his earthly envelope. He cannot melt into thin air nor disappear
+
+through cracks or chinks or crannies. If he go through a doorway, he
+
+must open the door like a mortal. And so we have this day to hunt out
+
+all his lairs and sterilise them. So we shall, if we have not yet catch
+
+him and destroy him, drive him to bay in some place where the catching
+
+and the destroying shall be, in time, sure.� Here I started up for I
+
+could not contain myself at the thought that the minutes and seconds so
+
+preciously laden with Mina�s life and happiness were flying from us,
+
+since whilst we talked action was impossible. But Van Helsing held up
+
+his hand warningly. �Nay, friend Jonathan,� he said, �in this, the
+
+quickest way home is the longest way, so your proverb say. We shall all
+
+act and act with desperate quick, when the time has come. But think, in
+
+all probable the key of the situation is in that house in Piccadilly.
+
+The Count may have many houses which he has bought. Of them he will have
+
+deeds of purchase, keys and other things. He will have paper that he
+
+write on; he will have his book of cheques. There are many belongings
+
+that he must have somewhere; why not in this place so central, so quiet,
+
+where he come and go by the front or the back at all hour, when in the
+
+very vast of the traffic there is none to notice. We shall go there and
+
+search that house; and when we learn what it holds, then we do what our
+
+friend Arthur call, in his phrases of hunt �stop the earths� and so we
+
+run down our old fox--so? is it not?�
+
+�Then let us come at once,� I cried, �we are wasting the precious,
+
+precious time!� The Professor did not move, but simply said:--
+
+�And how are we to get into that house in Piccadilly?�
+
+�Any way!� I cried. �We shall break in if need be.�
+
+�And your police; where will they be, and what will they say?�
+
+I was staggered; but I knew that if he wished to delay he had a good
+
+reason for it. So I said, as quietly as I could:--
+
+�Don�t wait more than need be; you know, I am sure, what torture I am
+
+in.�
+
+�Ah, my child, that I do; and indeed there is no wish of me to add to
+
+your anguish. But just think, what can we do, until all the world be at
+
+movement. Then will come our time. I have thought and thought, and it
+
+seems to me that the simplest way is the best of all. Now we wish to get
+
+into the house, but we have no key; is it not so?� I nodded.
+
+�Now suppose that you were, in truth, the owner of that house, and could
+
+not still get in; and think there was to you no conscience of the
+
+housebreaker, what would you do?�
+
+�I should get a respectable locksmith, and set him to work to pick the
+
+lock for me.�
+
+�And your police, they would interfere, would they not?�
+
+�Oh, no! not if they knew the man was properly employed.�
+
+�Then,� he looked at me as keenly as he spoke, �all that is in doubt is
+
+the conscience of the employer, and the belief of your policemen as to
+
+whether or no that employer has a good conscience or a bad one. Your
+
+police must indeed be zealous men and clever--oh, so clever!--in reading
+
+the heart, that they trouble themselves in such matter. No, no, my
+
+friend Jonathan, you go take the lock off a hundred empty house in this
+
+your London, or of any city in the world; and if you do it as such
+
+things are rightly done, and at the time such things are rightly done,
+
+no one will interfere. I have read of a gentleman who owned a so fine
+
+house in London, and when he went for months of summer to Switzerland
+
+and lock up his house, some burglar came and broke window at back and
+
+got in. Then he went and made open the shutters in front and walk out
+
+and in through the door, before the very eyes of the police. Then he
+
+have an auction in that house, and advertise it, and put up big notice;
+
+and when the day come he sell off by a great auctioneer all the goods of
+
+that other man who own them. Then he go to a builder, and he sell him
+
+that house, making an agreement that he pull it down and take all away
+
+within a certain time. And your police and other authority help him all
+
+they can. And when that owner come back from his holiday in Switzerland
+
+he find only an empty hole where his house had been. This was all done
+
+_en r�gle_; and in our work we shall be _en r�gle_ too. We shall not go
+
+so early that the policemen who have then little to think of, shall deem
+
+it strange; but we shall go after ten o�clock, when there are many
+
+about, and such things would be done were we indeed owners of the
+
+house.�
+
+I could not but see how right he was and the terrible despair of Mina�s
+
+face became relaxed a thought; there was hope in such good counsel. Van
+
+Helsing went on:--
+
+�When once within that house we may find more clues; at any rate some of
+
+us can remain there whilst the rest find the other places where there be
+
+more earth-boxes--at Bermondsey and Mile End.�
+
+Lord Godalming stood up. �I can be of some use here,� he said. �I shall
+
+wire to my people to have horses and carriages where they will be most
+
+convenient.�
+
+�Look here, old fellow,� said Morris, �it is a capital idea to have all
+
+ready in case we want to go horsebacking; but don�t you think that one
+
+of your snappy carriages with its heraldic adornments in a byway of
+
+Walworth or Mile End would attract too much attention for our purposes?
+
+It seems to me that we ought to take cabs when we go south or east; and
+
+even leave them somewhere near the neighbourhood we are going to.�
+
+�Friend Quincey is right!� said the Professor. �His head is what you
+
+call in plane with the horizon. It is a difficult thing that we go to
+
+do, and we do not want no peoples to watch us if so it may.�
+
+Mina took a growing interest in everything and I was rejoiced to see
+
+that the exigency of affairs was helping her to forget for a time the
+
+terrible experience of the night. She was very, very pale--almost
+
+ghastly, and so thin that her lips were drawn away, showing her teeth in
+
+somewhat of prominence. I did not mention this last, lest it should give
+
+her needless pain; but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think of
+
+what had occurred with poor Lucy when the Count had sucked her blood. As
+
+yet there was no sign of the teeth growing sharper; but the time as yet
+
+was short, and there was time for fear.
+
+When we came to the discussion of the sequence of our efforts and of the
+
+disposition of our forces, there were new sources of doubt. It was
+
+finally agreed that before starting for Piccadilly we should destroy the
+
+Count�s lair close at hand. In case he should find it out too soon, we
+
+should thus be still ahead of him in our work of destruction; and his
+
+presence in his purely material shape, and at his weakest, might give us
+
+some new clue.
+
+As to the disposal of forces, it was suggested by the Professor that,
+
+after our visit to Carfax, we should all enter the house in Piccadilly;
+
+that the two doctors and I should remain there, whilst Lord Godalming
+
+and Quincey found the lairs at Walworth and Mile End and destroyed them.
+
+It was possible, if not likely, the Professor urged, that the Count
+
+might appear in Piccadilly during the day, and that if so we might be
+
+able to cope with him then and there. At any rate, we might be able to
+
+follow him in force. To this plan I strenuously objected, and so far as
+
+my going was concerned, for I said that I intended to stay and protect
+
+Mina, I thought that my mind was made up on the subject; but Mina would
+
+not listen to my objection. She said that there might be some law matter
+
+in which I could be useful; that amongst the Count�s papers might be
+
+some clue which I could understand out of my experience in Transylvania;
+
+and that, as it was, all the strength we could muster was required to
+
+cope with the Count�s extraordinary power. I had to give in, for Mina�s
+
+resolution was fixed; she said that it was the last hope for _her_ that
+
+we should all work together. �As for me,� she said, �I have no fear.
+
+Things have been as bad as they can be; and whatever may happen must
+
+have in it some element of hope or comfort. Go, my husband! God can, if
+
+He wishes it, guard me as well alone as with any one present.� So I
+
+started up crying out: �Then in God�s name let us come at once, for we
+
+are losing time. The Count may come to Piccadilly earlier than we
+
+think.�
+
+�Not so!� said Van Helsing, holding up his hand.
+
+�But why?� I asked.
+
+�Do you forget,� he said, with actually a smile, �that last night he
+
+banqueted heavily, and will sleep late?�
+
+Did I forget! shall I ever--can I ever! Can any of us ever forget that
+
+terrible scene! Mina struggled hard to keep her brave countenance; but
+
+the pain overmastered her and she put her hands before her face, and
+
+shuddered whilst she moaned. Van Helsing had not intended to recall her
+
+frightful experience. He had simply lost sight of her and her part in
+
+the affair in his intellectual effort. When it struck him what he said,
+
+he was horrified at his thoughtlessness and tried to comfort her. �Oh,
+
+Madam Mina,� he said, �dear, dear Madam Mina, alas! that I of all who so
+
+reverence you should have said anything so forgetful. These stupid old
+
+lips of mine and this stupid old head do not deserve so; but you will
+
+forget it, will you not?� He bent low beside her as he spoke; she took
+
+his hand, and looking at him through her tears, said hoarsely:--
+
+�No, I shall not forget, for it is well that I remember; and with it I
+
+have so much in memory of you that is sweet, that I take it all
+
+together. Now, you must all be going soon. Breakfast is ready, and we
+
+must all eat that we may be strong.�
+
+Breakfast was a strange meal to us all. We tried to be cheerful and
+
+encourage each other, and Mina was the brightest and most cheerful of
+
+us. When it was over, Van Helsing stood up and said:--
+
+�Now, my dear friends, we go forth to our terrible enterprise. Are we
+
+all armed, as we were on that night when first we visited our enemy�s
+
+lair; armed against ghostly as well as carnal attack?� We all assured
+
+him. �Then it is well. Now, Madam Mina, you are in any case _quite_ safe
+
+here until the sunset; and before then we shall return--if---- We shall
+
+return! But before we go let me see you armed against personal attack. I
+
+have myself, since you came down, prepared your chamber by the placing
+
+of things of which we know, so that He may not enter. Now let me guard
+
+yourself. On your forehead I touch this piece of Sacred Wafer in the
+
+name of the Father, the Son, and----�
+
+There was a fearful scream which almost froze our hearts to hear. As he
+
+had placed the Wafer on Mina�s forehead, it had seared it--had burned
+
+into the flesh as though it had been a piece of white-hot metal. My poor
+
+darling�s brain had told her the significance of the fact as quickly as
+
+her nerves received the pain of it; and the two so overwhelmed her that
+
+her overwrought nature had its voice in that dreadful scream. But the
+
+words to her thought came quickly; the echo of the scream had not ceased
+
+to ring on the air when there came the reaction, and she sank on her
+
+knees on the floor in an agony of abasement. Pulling her beautiful hair
+
+over her face, as the leper of old his mantle, she wailed out:--
+
+�Unclean! Unclean! Even the Almighty shuns my polluted flesh! I must
+
+bear this mark of shame upon my forehead until the Judgment Day.� They
+
+all paused. I had thrown myself beside her in an agony of helpless
+
+grief, and putting my arms around held her tight. For a few minutes our
+
+sorrowful hearts beat together, whilst the friends around us turned away
+
+their eyes that ran tears silently. Then Van Helsing turned and said
+
+gravely; so gravely that I could not help feeling that he was in some
+
+way inspired, and was stating things outside himself:--
+
+�It may be that you may have to bear that mark till God himself see fit,
+
+as He most surely shall, on the Judgment Day, to redress all wrongs of
+
+the earth and of His children that He has placed thereon. And oh, Madam
+
+Mina, my dear, my dear, may we who love you be there to see, when that
+
+red scar, the sign of God�s knowledge of what has been, shall pass away,
+
+and leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know. For so surely as
+
+we live, that scar shall pass away when God sees right to lift the
+
+burden that is hard upon us. Till then we bear our Cross, as His Son did
+
+in obedience to His Will. It may be that we are chosen instruments of
+
+His good pleasure, and that we ascend to His bidding as that other
+
+through stripes and shame; through tears and blood; through doubts and
+
+fears, and all that makes the difference between God and man.�
+
+There was hope in his words, and comfort; and they made for resignation.
+
+Mina and I both felt so, and simultaneously we each took one of the old
+
+man�s hands and bent over and kissed it. Then without a word we all
+
+knelt down together, and, all holding hands, swore to be true to each
+
+other. We men pledged ourselves to raise the veil of sorrow from the
+
+head of her whom, each in his own way, we loved; and we prayed for help
+
+and guidance in the terrible task which lay before us.
+
+It was then time to start. So I said farewell to Mina, a parting which
+
+neither of us shall forget to our dying day; and we set out.
+
+To one thing I have made up my mind: if we find out that Mina must be a
+
+vampire in the end, then she shall not go into that unknown and terrible
+
+land alone. I suppose it is thus that in old times one vampire meant
+
+many; just as their hideous bodies could only rest in sacred earth, so
+
+the holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for their ghastly ranks.
+
+We entered Carfax without trouble and found all things the same as on
+
+the first occasion. It was hard to believe that amongst so prosaic
+
+surroundings of neglect and dust and decay there was any ground for such
+
+fear as already we knew. Had not our minds been made up, and had there
+
+not been terrible memories to spur us on, we could hardly have proceeded
+
+with our task. We found no papers, or any sign of use in the house; and
+
+in the old chapel the great boxes looked just as we had seen them last.
+
+Dr. Van Helsing said to us solemnly as we stood before them:--
+
+�And now, my friends, we have a duty here to do. We must sterilise this
+
+earth, so sacred of holy memories, that he has brought from a far
+
+distant land for such fell use. He has chosen this earth because it has
+
+been holy. Thus we defeat him with his own weapon, for we make it more
+
+holy still. It was sanctified to such use of man, now we sanctify it to
+
+God.� As he spoke he took from his bag a screwdriver and a wrench, and
+
+very soon the top of one of the cases was thrown open. The earth smelled
+
+musty and close; but we did not somehow seem to mind, for our attention
+
+was concentrated on the Professor. Taking from his box a piece of the
+
+Sacred Wafer he laid it reverently on the earth, and then shutting down
+
+the lid began to screw it home, we aiding him as he worked.
+
+One by one we treated in the same way each of the great boxes, and left
+
+them as we had found them to all appearance; but in each was a portion
+
+of the Host.
+
+When we closed the door behind us, the Professor said solemnly:--
+
+�So much is already done. If it may be that with all the others we can
+
+be so successful, then the sunset of this evening may shine on Madam
+
+Mina�s forehead all white as ivory and with no stain!�
+
+As we passed across the lawn on our way to the station to catch our
+
+train we could see the front of the asylum. I looked eagerly, and in the
+
+window of my own room saw Mina. I waved my hand to her, and nodded to
+
+tell that our work there was successfully accomplished. She nodded in
+
+reply to show that she understood. The last I saw, she was waving her
+
+hand in farewell. It was with a heavy heart that we sought the station
+
+and just caught the train, which was steaming in as we reached the
+
+platform.
+
+I have written this in the train.
+
+*       *       *       *       *
+
+_Piccadilly, 12:30 o�clock._--Just before we reached Fenchurch Street
+
+Lord Godalming said to me:--
+
+�Quincey and I will find a locksmith. You had better not come with us in
+
+case there should be any difficulty; for under the circumstances it
+
+wouldn�t seem so bad for us to break into an empty house. But you are a
+
+solicitor and the Incorporated Law Society might tell you that you
+
+should have known better.� I demurred as to my not sharing any danger
+
+even of odium, but he went on: �Besides, it will attract less attention
+
+if there are not too many of us. My title will make it all right with
+
+the locksmith, and with any policeman that may come along. You had
+
+better go with Jack and the Professor and stay in the Green Park,
+
+somewhere in sight of the house; and when you see the door opened and
+
+the smith has gone away, do you all come across. We shall be on the
+
+lookout for you, and shall let you in.�
+
+�The advice is good!� said Van Helsing, so we said no more. Godalming
+
+and Morris hurried off in a cab, we following in another. At the corner
+
+of Arlington Street our contingent got out and strolled into the Green
+
+Park. My heart beat as I saw the house on which so much of our hope was
+
+centred, looming up grim and silent in its deserted condition amongst
+
+its more lively and spruce-looking neighbours. We sat down on a bench
+
+within good view, and began to smoke cigars so as to attract as little
+
+attention as possible. The minutes seemed to pass with leaden feet as we
+
+waited for the coming of the others.
+
+At length we saw a four-wheeler drive up. Out of it, in leisurely
+
+fashion, got Lord Godalming and Morris; and down from the box descended
+
+a thick-set working man with his rush-woven basket of tools. Morris paid
+
+the cabman, who touched his hat and drove away. Together the two
+
+ascended the steps, and Lord Godalming pointed out what he wanted done.
+
+The workman took off his coat leisurely and hung it on one of the spikes
+
+of the rail, saying something to a policeman who just then sauntered
+
+along. The policeman nodded acquiescence, and the man kneeling down
+
+placed his bag beside him. After searching through it, he took out a
+
+selection of tools which he produced to lay beside him in orderly
+
+fashion. Then he stood up, looked into the keyhole, blew into it, and
+
+turning to his employers, made some remark. Lord Godalming smiled, and
+
+the man lifted a good-sized bunch of keys; selecting one of them, he
+
+began to probe the lock, as if feeling his way with it. After fumbling
+
+about for a bit he tried a second, and then a third. All at once the
+
+door opened under a slight push from him, and he and the two others
+
+entered the hall. We sat still; my own cigar burnt furiously, but Van
+
+Helsing�s went cold altogether. We waited patiently as we saw the
+
+workman come out and bring in his bag. Then he held the door partly
+
+open, steadying it with his knees, whilst he fitted a key to the lock.
+
+This he finally handed to Lord Godalming, who took out his purse and
+
+gave him something. The man touched his hat, took his bag, put on his
+
+coat and departed; not a soul took the slightest notice of the whole
+
+transaction.
+
+When the man had fairly gone, we three crossed the street and knocked at
+
+the door. It was immediately opened by Quincey Morris, beside whom stood
+
+Lord Godalming lighting a cigar.
+
+�The place smells so vilely,� said the latter as we came in. It did
+
+indeed smell vilely--like the old chapel at Carfax--and with our
+
+previous experience it was plain to us that the Count had been using the
+
+place pretty freely. We moved to explore the house, all keeping together
+
+in case of attack; for we knew we had a strong and wily enemy to deal
+
+with, and as yet we did not know whether the Count might not be in the
+
+house. In the dining-room, which lay at the back of the hall, we found
+
+eight boxes of earth. Eight boxes only out of the nine, which we sought!
+
+Our work was not over, and would never be until we should have found the
+
+missing box. First we opened the shutters of the window which looked out
+
+across a narrow stone-flagged yard at the blank face of a stable,
+
+pointed to look like the front of a miniature house. There were no
+
+windows in it, so we were not afraid of being over-looked. We did not
+
+lose any time in examining the chests. With the tools which we had
+
+brought with us we opened them, one by one, and treated them as we had
+
+treated those others in the old chapel. It was evident to us that the
+
+Count was not at present in the house, and we proceeded to search for
+
+any of his effects.
+
+After a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms, from basement to attic,
+
+we came to the conclusion that the dining-room contained any effects
+
+which might belong to the Count; and so we proceeded to minutely examine
+
+them. They lay in a sort of orderly disorder on the great dining-room
+
+table. There were title deeds of the Piccadilly house in a great bundle;
+
+deeds of the purchase of the houses at Mile End and Bermondsey;
+
+note-paper, envelopes, and pens and ink. All were covered up in thin
+
+wrapping paper to keep them from the dust. There were also a clothes
+
+brush, a brush and comb, and a jug and basin--the latter containing
+
+dirty water which was reddened as if with blood. Last of all was a
+
+little heap of keys of all sorts and sizes, probably those belonging to
+
+the other houses. When we had examined this last find, Lord Godalming
+
+and Quincey Morris taking accurate notes of the various addresses of the
+
+houses in the East and the South, took with them the keys in a great
+
+bunch, and set out to destroy the boxes in these places. The rest of us
+
+are, with what patience we can, waiting their return--or the coming of
+
+the Count.

+Chapter DR. JEKYLL WAS QUITE AT EASE
+
+A fortnight later, by excellent good fortune, the doctor gave one of
+
+his pleasant dinners to some five or six old cronies, all intelligent,
+
+reputable men and all judges of good wine; and Mr. Utterson so
+
+contrived that he remained behind after the others had departed. This
+
+was no new arrangement, but a thing that had befallen many scores of
+
+times. Where Utterson was liked, he was liked well. Hosts loved to
+
+detain the dry lawyer, when the light-hearted and loose-tongued had
+
+already their foot on the threshold; they liked to sit a while in his
+
+unobtrusive company, practising for solitude, sobering their minds in
+
+the man�s rich silence after the expense and strain of gaiety. To this
+
+rule, Dr. Jekyll was no exception; and as he now sat on the opposite
+
+side of the fire�a large, well-made, smooth-faced man of fifty, with
+
+something of a slyish cast perhaps, but every mark of capacity and
+
+kindness�you could see by his looks that he cherished for Mr. Utterson
+
+a sincere and warm affection.
+
+�I have been wanting to speak to you, Jekyll,� began the latter. �You
+
+know that will of yours?�
+
+A close observer might have gathered that the topic was distasteful;
+
+but the doctor carried it off gaily. �My poor Utterson,� said he, �you
+
+are unfortunate in such a client. I never saw a man so distressed as
+
+you were by my will; unless it were that hide-bound pedant, Lanyon, at
+
+what he called my scientific heresies. O, I know he�s a good fellow�you
+
+needn�t frown�an excellent fellow, and I always mean to see more of
+
+him; but a hide-bound pedant for all that; an ignorant, blatant pedant.
+
+I was never more disappointed in any man than Lanyon.�
+
+�You know I never approved of it,� pursued Utterson, ruthlessly
+
+disregarding the fresh topic.
+
+�My will? Yes, certainly, I know that,� said the doctor, a trifle
+
+sharply. �You have told me so.�
+
+�Well, I tell you so again,� continued the lawyer. �I have been
+
+learning something of young Hyde.�
+
+The large handsome face of Dr. Jekyll grew pale to the very lips, and
+
+there came a blackness about his eyes. �I do not care to hear more,�
+
+said he. �This is a matter I thought we had agreed to drop.�
+
+�What I heard was abominable,� said Utterson.
+
+�It can make no change. You do not understand my position,� returned
+
+the doctor, with a certain incoherency of manner. �I am painfully
+
+situated, Utterson; my position is a very strange�a very strange one.
+
+It is one of those affairs that cannot be mended by talking.�
+
+�Jekyll,� said Utterson, �you know me: I am a man to be trusted. Make a
+
+clean breast of this in confidence; and I make no doubt I can get you
+
+out of it.�
+
+�My good Utterson,� said the doctor, �this is very good of you, this is
+
+downright good of you, and I cannot find words to thank you in. I
+
+believe you fully; I would trust you before any man alive, ay, before
+
+myself, if I could make the choice; but indeed it isn�t what you fancy;
+
+it is not as bad as that; and just to put your good heart at rest, I
+
+will tell you one thing: the moment I choose, I can be rid of Mr. Hyde.
+
+I give you my hand upon that; and I thank you again and again; and I
+
+will just add one little word, Utterson, that I�m sure you�ll take in
+
+good part: this is a private matter, and I beg of you to let it sleep.�
+
+Utterson reflected a little, looking in the fire.
+
+�I have no doubt you are perfectly right,� he said at last, getting to
+
+his feet.
+
+�Well, but since we have touched upon this business, and for the last
+
+time I hope,� continued the doctor, �there is one point I should like
+
+you to understand. I have really a very great interest in poor Hyde. I
+
+know you have seen him; he told me so; and I fear he was rude. But I do
+
+sincerely take a great, a very great interest in that young man; and if
+
+I am taken away, Utterson, I wish you to promise me that you will bear
+
+with him and get his rights for him. I think you would, if you knew
+
+all; and it would be a weight off my mind if you would promise.�
+
+�I can�t pretend that I shall ever like him,� said the lawyer.
+
+�I don�t ask that,� pleaded Jekyll, laying his hand upon the other�s
+
+arm; �I only ask for justice; I only ask you to help him for my sake,
+
+when I am no longer here.�
+
+Utterson heaved an irrepressible sigh. �Well,� said he, �I promise.�

+Chapter HENRY JEKYLL�S FULL STATEMENT OF THE CASE
+
+I was born in the year 18� to a large fortune, endowed besides with
+
+excellent parts, inclined by nature to industry, fond of the respect of
+
+the wise and good among my fellowmen, and thus, as might have been
+
+supposed, with every guarantee of an honourable and distinguished
+
+future. And indeed the worst of my faults was a certain impatient
+
+gaiety of disposition, such as has made the happiness of many, but such
+
+as I found it hard to reconcile with my imperious desire to carry my
+
+head high, and wear a more than commonly grave countenance before the
+
+public. Hence it came about that I concealed my pleasures; and that
+
+when I reached years of reflection, and began to look round me and take
+
+stock of my progress and position in the world, I stood already
+
+committed to a profound duplicity of life. Many a man would have even
+
+blazoned such irregularities as I was guilty of; but from the high
+
+views that I had set before me, I regarded and hid them with an almost
+
+morbid sense of shame. It was thus rather the exacting nature of my
+
+aspirations than any particular degradation in my faults, that made me
+
+what I was, and, with even a deeper trench than in the majority of men,
+
+severed in me those provinces of good and ill which divide and compound
+
+man�s dual nature. In this case, I was driven to reflect deeply and
+
+inveterately on that hard law of life, which lies at the root of
+
+religion and is one of the most plentiful springs of distress. Though
+
+so profound a double-dealer, I was in no sense a hypocrite; both sides
+
+of me were in dead earnest; I was no more myself when I laid aside
+
+restraint and plunged in shame, than when I laboured, in the eye of
+
+day, at the furtherance of knowledge or the relief of sorrow and
+
+suffering. And it chanced that the direction of my scientific studies,
+
+which led wholly towards the mystic and the transcendental, reacted and
+
+shed a strong light on this consciousness of the perennial war among my
+
+members. With every day, and from both sides of my intelligence, the
+
+moral and the intellectual, I thus drew steadily nearer to that truth,
+
+by whose partial discovery I have been doomed to such a dreadful
+
+shipwreck: that man is not truly one, but truly two. I say two, because
+
+the state of my own knowledge does not pass beyond that point. Others
+
+will follow, others will outstrip me on the same lines; and I hazard
+
+the guess that man will be ultimately known for a mere polity of
+
+multifarious, incongruous and independent denizens. I, for my part,
+
+from the nature of my life, advanced infallibly in one direction and in
+
+one direction only. It was on the moral side, and in my own person,
+
+that I learned to recognise the thorough and primitive duality of man;
+
+I saw that, of the two natures that contended in the field of my
+
+consciousness, even if I could rightly be said to be either, it was
+
+only because I was radically both; and from an early date, even before
+
+the course of my scientific discoveries had begun to suggest the most
+
+naked possibility of such a miracle, I had learned to dwell with
+
+pleasure, as a beloved daydream, on the thought of the separation of
+
+these elements. If each, I told myself, could be housed in separate
+
+identities, life would be relieved of all that was unbearable; the
+
+unjust might go his way, delivered from the aspirations and remorse of
+
+his more upright twin; and the just could walk steadfastly and securely
+
+on his upward path, doing the good things in which he found his
+
+pleasure, and no longer exposed to disgrace and penitence by the hands
+
+of this extraneous evil. It was the curse of mankind that these
+
+incongruous faggots were thus bound together�that in the agonised womb
+
+of consciousness, these polar twins should be continuously struggling.
+
+How, then were they dissociated?
+
+I was so far in my reflections when, as I have said, a side light began
+
+to shine upon the subject from the laboratory table. I began to
+
+perceive more deeply than it has ever yet been stated, the trembling
+
+immateriality, the mistlike transience, of this seemingly so solid body
+
+in which we walk attired. Certain agents I found to have the power to
+
+shake and pluck back that fleshly vestment, even as a wind might toss
+
+the curtains of a pavilion. For two good reasons, I will not enter
+
+deeply into this scientific branch of my confession. First, because I
+
+have been made to learn that the doom and burthen of our life is bound
+
+for ever on man�s shoulders, and when the attempt is made to cast it
+
+off, it but returns upon us with more unfamiliar and more awful
+
+pressure. Second, because, as my narrative will make, alas! too
+
+evident, my discoveries were incomplete. Enough then, that I not only
+
+recognised my natural body from the mere aura and effulgence of certain
+
+of the powers that made up my spirit, but managed to compound a drug by
+
+which these powers should be dethroned from their supremacy, and a
+
+second form and countenance substituted, none the less natural to me
+
+because they were the expression, and bore the stamp of lower elements
+
+in my soul.
+
+I hesitated long before I put this theory to the test of practice. I
+
+knew well that I risked death; for any drug that so potently controlled
+
+and shook the very fortress of identity, might, by the least scruple of
+
+an overdose or at the least inopportunity in the moment of exhibition,
+
+utterly blot out that immaterial tabernacle which I looked to it to
+
+change. But the temptation of a discovery so singular and profound at
+
+last overcame the suggestions of alarm. I had long since prepared my
+
+tincture; I purchased at once, from a firm of wholesale chemists, a
+
+large quantity of a particular salt which I knew, from my experiments,
+
+to be the last ingredient required; and late one accursed night, I
+
+compounded the elements, watched them boil and smoke together in the
+
+glass, and when the ebullition had subsided, with a strong glow of
+
+courage, drank off the potion.
+
+The most racking pangs succeeded: a grinding in the bones, deadly
+
+nausea, and a horror of the spirit that cannot be exceeded at the hour
+
+of birth or death. Then these agonies began swiftly to subside, and I
+
+came to myself as if out of a great sickness. There was something
+
+strange in my sensations, something indescribably new and, from its
+
+very novelty, incredibly sweet. I felt younger, lighter, happier in
+
+body; within I was conscious of a heady recklessness, a current of
+
+disordered sensual images running like a millrace in my fancy, a
+
+solution of the bonds of obligation, an unknown but not an innocent
+
+freedom of the soul. I knew myself, at the first breath of this new
+
+life, to be more wicked, tenfold more wicked, sold a slave to my
+
+original evil; and the thought, in that moment, braced and delighted me
+
+like wine. I stretched out my hands, exulting in the freshness of these
+
+sensations; and in the act, I was suddenly aware that I had lost in
+
+stature.
+
+There was no mirror, at that date, in my room; that which stands beside
+
+me as I write, was brought there later on and for the very purpose of
+
+these transformations. The night however, was far gone into the
+
+morning�the morning, black as it was, was nearly ripe for the
+
+conception of the day�the inmates of my house were locked in the most
+
+rigorous hours of slumber; and I determined, flushed as I was with hope
+
+and triumph, to venture in my new shape as far as to my bedroom. I
+
+crossed the yard, wherein the constellations looked down upon me, I
+
+could have thought, with wonder, the first creature of that sort that
+
+their unsleeping vigilance had yet disclosed to them; I stole through
+
+the corridors, a stranger in my own house; and coming to my room, I saw
+
+for the first time the appearance of Edward Hyde.
+
+I must here speak by theory alone, saying not that which I know, but
+
+that which I suppose to be most probable. The evil side of my nature,
+
+to which I had now transferred the stamping efficacy, was less robust
+
+and less developed than the good which I had just deposed. Again, in
+
+the course of my life, which had been, after all, nine tenths a life of
+
+effort, virtue and control, it had been much less exercised and much
+
+less exhausted. And hence, as I think, it came about that Edward Hyde
+
+was so much smaller, slighter and younger than Henry Jekyll. Even as
+
+good shone upon the countenance of the one, evil was written broadly
+
+and plainly on the face of the other. Evil besides (which I must still
+
+believe to be the lethal side of man) had left on that body an imprint
+
+of deformity and decay. And yet when I looked upon that ugly idol in
+
+the glass, I was conscious of no repugnance, rather of a leap of
+
+welcome. This, too, was myself. It seemed natural and human. In my eyes
+
+it bore a livelier image of the spirit, it seemed more express and
+
+single, than the imperfect and divided countenance I had been hitherto
+
+accustomed to call mine. And in so far I was doubtless right. I have
+
+observed that when I wore the semblance of Edward Hyde, none could come
+
+near to me at first without a visible misgiving of the flesh. This, as
+
+I take it, was because all human beings, as we meet them, are
+
+commingled out of good and evil: and Edward Hyde, alone in the ranks of
+
+mankind, was pure evil.
+
+I lingered but a moment at the mirror: the second and conclusive
+
+experiment had yet to be attempted; it yet remained to be seen if I had
+
+lost my identity beyond redemption and must flee before daylight from a
+
+house that was no longer mine; and hurrying back to my cabinet, I once
+
+more prepared and drank the cup, once more suffered the pangs of
+
+dissolution, and came to myself once more with the character, the
+
+stature and the face of Henry Jekyll.
+
+That night I had come to the fatal cross-roads. Had I approached my
+
+discovery in a more noble spirit, had I risked the experiment while
+
+under the empire of generous or pious aspirations, all must have been
+
+otherwise, and from these agonies of death and birth, I had come forth
+
+an angel instead of a fiend. The drug had no discriminating action; it
+
+was neither diabolical nor divine; it but shook the doors of the
+
+prisonhouse of my disposition; and like the captives of Philippi, that
+
+which stood within ran forth. At that time my virtue slumbered; my
+
+evil, kept awake by ambition, was alert and swift to seize the
+
+occasion; and the thing that was projected was Edward Hyde. Hence,
+
+although I had now two characters as well as two appearances, one was
+
+wholly evil, and the other was still the old Henry Jekyll, that
+
+incongruous compound of whose reformation and improvement I had already
+
+learned to despair. The movement was thus wholly toward the worse.
+
+Even at that time, I had not conquered my aversions to the dryness of a
+
+life of study. I would still be merrily disposed at times; and as my
+
+pleasures were (to say the least) undignified, and I was not only well
+
+known and highly considered, but growing towards the elderly man, this
+
+incoherency of my life was daily growing more unwelcome. It was on this
+
+side that my new power tempted me until I fell in slavery. I had but to
+
+drink the cup, to doff at once the body of the noted professor, and to
+
+assume, like a thick cloak, that of Edward Hyde. I smiled at the
+
+notion; it seemed to me at the time to be humourous; and I made my
+
+preparations with the most studious care. I took and furnished that
+
+house in Soho, to which Hyde was tracked by the police; and engaged as
+
+a housekeeper a creature whom I knew well to be silent and
+
+unscrupulous. On the other side, I announced to my servants that a Mr.
+
+Hyde (whom I described) was to have full liberty and power about my
+
+house in the square; and to parry mishaps, I even called and made
+
+myself a familiar object, in my second character. I next drew up that
+
+will to which you so much objected; so that if anything befell me in
+
+the person of Dr. Jekyll, I could enter on that of Edward Hyde without
+
+pecuniary loss. And thus fortified, as I supposed, on every side, I
+
+began to profit by the strange immunities of my position.
+
+Men have before hired bravos to transact their crimes, while their own
+
+person and reputation sat under shelter. I was the first that ever did
+
+so for his pleasures. I was the first that could plod in the public eye
+
+with a load of genial respectability, and in a moment, like a
+
+schoolboy, strip off these lendings and spring headlong into the sea of
+
+liberty. But for me, in my impenetrable mantle, the safety was
+
+complete. Think of it�I did not even exist! Let me but escape into my
+
+laboratory door, give me but a second or two to mix and swallow the
+
+draught that I had always standing ready; and whatever he had done,
+
+Edward Hyde would pass away like the stain of breath upon a mirror; and
+
+there in his stead, quietly at home, trimming the midnight lamp in his
+
+study, a man who could afford to laugh at suspicion, would be Henry
+
+Jekyll.
+
+The pleasures which I made haste to seek in my disguise were, as I have
+
+said, undignified; I would scarce use a harder term. But in the hands
+
+of Edward Hyde, they soon began to turn toward the monstrous. When I
+
+would come back from these excursions, I was often plunged into a kind
+
+of wonder at my vicarious depravity. This familiar that I called out of
+
+my own soul, and sent forth alone to do his good pleasure, was a being
+
+inherently malign and villainous; his every act and thought centered on
+
+self; drinking pleasure with bestial avidity from any degree of torture
+
+to another; relentless like a man of stone. Henry Jekyll stood at times
+
+aghast before the acts of Edward Hyde; but the situation was apart from
+
+ordinary laws, and insidiously relaxed the grasp of conscience. It was
+
+Hyde, after all, and Hyde alone, that was guilty. Jekyll was no worse;
+
+he woke again to his good qualities seemingly unimpaired; he would even
+
+make haste, where it was possible, to undo the evil done by Hyde. And
+
+thus his conscience slumbered.
+
+Into the details of the infamy at which I thus connived (for even now I
+
+can scarce grant that I committed it) I have no design of entering; I
+
+mean but to point out the warnings and the successive steps with which
+
+my chastisement approached. I met with one accident which, as it
+
+brought on no consequence, I shall no more than mention. An act of
+
+cruelty to a child aroused against me the anger of a passer-by, whom I
+
+recognised the other day in the person of your kinsman; the doctor and
+
+the child�s family joined him; there were moments when I feared for my
+
+life; and at last, in order to pacify their too just resentment, Edward
+
+Hyde had to bring them to the door, and pay them in a cheque drawn in
+
+the name of Henry Jekyll. But this danger was easily eliminated from
+
+the future, by opening an account at another bank in the name of Edward
+
+Hyde himself; and when, by sloping my own hand backward, I had supplied
+
+my double with a signature, I thought I sat beyond the reach of fate.
+
+Some two months before the murder of Sir Danvers, I had been out for
+
+one of my adventures, had returned at a late hour, and woke the next
+
+day in bed with somewhat odd sensations. It was in vain I looked about
+
+me; in vain I saw the decent furniture and tall proportions of my room
+
+in the square; in vain that I recognised the pattern of the bed
+
+curtains and the design of the mahogany frame; something still kept
+
+insisting that I was not where I was, that I had not wakened where I
+
+seemed to be, but in the little room in Soho where I was accustomed to
+
+sleep in the body of Edward Hyde. I smiled to myself, and in my
+
+psychological way, began lazily to inquire into the elements of this
+
+illusion, occasionally, even as I did so, dropping back into a
+
+comfortable morning doze. I was still so engaged when, in one of my
+
+more wakeful moments, my eyes fell upon my hand. Now the hand of Henry
+
+Jekyll (as you have often remarked) was professional in shape and size;
+
+it was large, firm, white and comely. But the hand which I now saw,
+
+clearly enough, in the yellow light of a mid-London morning, lying half
+
+shut on the bedclothes, was lean, corded, knuckly, of a dusky pallor
+
+and thickly shaded with a swart growth of hair. It was the hand of
+
+Edward Hyde.
+
+I must have stared upon it for near half a minute, sunk as I was in the
+
+mere stupidity of wonder, before terror woke up in my breast as sudden
+
+and startling as the crash of cymbals; and bounding from my bed I
+
+rushed to the mirror. At the sight that met my eyes, my blood was
+
+changed into something exquisitely thin and icy. Yes, I had gone to bed
+
+Henry Jekyll, I had awakened Edward Hyde. How was this to be explained?
+
+I asked myself; and then, with another bound of terror�how was it to be
+
+remedied? It was well on in the morning; the servants were up; all my
+
+drugs were in the cabinet�a long journey down two pairs of stairs,
+
+through the back passage, across the open court and through the
+
+anatomical theatre, from where I was then standing horror-struck. It
+
+might indeed be possible to cover my face; but of what use was that,
+
+when I was unable to conceal the alteration in my stature? And then
+
+with an overpowering sweetness of relief, it came back upon my mind
+
+that the servants were already used to the coming and going of my
+
+second self. I had soon dressed, as well as I was able, in clothes of
+
+my own size: had soon passed through the house, where Bradshaw stared
+
+and drew back at seeing Mr. Hyde at such an hour and in such a strange
+
+array; and ten minutes later, Dr. Jekyll had returned to his own shape
+
+and was sitting down, with a darkened brow, to make a feint of
+
+breakfasting.
+
+Small indeed was my appetite. This inexplicable incident, this reversal
+
+of my previous experience, seemed, like the Babylonian finger on the
+
+wall, to be spelling out the letters of my judgment; and I began to
+
+reflect more seriously than ever before on the issues and possibilities
+
+of my double existence. That part of me which I had the power of
+
+projecting, had lately been much exercised and nourished; it had seemed
+
+to me of late as though the body of Edward Hyde had grown in stature,
+
+as though (when I wore that form) I were conscious of a more generous
+
+tide of blood; and I began to spy a danger that, if this were much
+
+prolonged, the balance of my nature might be permanently overthrown,
+
+the power of voluntary change be forfeited, and the character of Edward
+
+Hyde become irrevocably mine. The power of the drug had not been always
+
+equally displayed. Once, very early in my career, it had totally failed
+
+me; since then I had been obliged on more than one occasion to double,
+
+and once, with infinite risk of death, to treble the amount; and these
+
+rare uncertainties had cast hitherto the sole shadow on my contentment.
+
+Now, however, and in the light of that morning�s accident, I was led to
+
+remark that whereas, in the beginning, the difficulty had been to throw
+
+off the body of Jekyll, it had of late gradually but decidedly
+
+transferred itself to the other side. All things therefore seemed to
+
+point to this; that I was slowly losing hold of my original and better
+
+self, and becoming slowly incorporated with my second and worse.
+
+Between these two, I now felt I had to choose. My two natures had
+
+memory in common, but all other faculties were most unequally shared
+
+between them. Jekyll (who was composite) now with the most sensitive
+
+apprehensions, now with a greedy gusto, projected and shared in the
+
+pleasures and adventures of Hyde; but Hyde was indifferent to Jekyll,
+
+or but remembered him as the mountain bandit remembers the cavern in
+
+which he conceals himself from pursuit. Jekyll had more than a father�s
+
+interest; Hyde had more than a son�s indifference. To cast in my lot
+
+with Jekyll, was to die to those appetites which I had long secretly
+
+indulged and had of late begun to pamper. To cast it in with Hyde, was
+
+to die to a thousand interests and aspirations, and to become, at a
+
+blow and forever, despised and friendless. The bargain might appear
+
+unequal; but there was still another consideration in the scales; for
+
+while Jekyll would suffer smartingly in the fires of abstinence, Hyde
+
+would be not even conscious of all that he had lost. Strange as my
+
+circumstances were, the terms of this debate are as old and commonplace
+
+as man; much the same inducements and alarms cast the die for any
+
+tempted and trembling sinner; and it fell out with me, as it falls with
+
+so vast a majority of my fellows, that I chose the better part and was
+
+found wanting in the strength to keep to it.
+
+Yes, I preferred the elderly and discontented doctor, surrounded by
+
+friends and cherishing honest hopes; and bade a resolute farewell to
+
+the liberty, the comparative youth, the light step, leaping impulses
+
+and secret pleasures, that I had enjoyed in the disguise of Hyde. I
+
+made this choice perhaps with some unconscious reservation, for I
+
+neither gave up the house in Soho, nor destroyed the clothes of Edward
+
+Hyde, which still lay ready in my cabinet. For two months, however, I
+
+was true to my determination; for two months, I led a life of such
+
+severity as I had never before attained to, and enjoyed the
+
+compensations of an approving conscience. But time began at last to
+
+obliterate the freshness of my alarm; the praises of conscience began
+
+to grow into a thing of course; I began to be tortured with throes and
+
+longings, as of Hyde struggling after freedom; and at last, in an hour
+
+of moral weakness, I once again compounded and swallowed the
+
+transforming draught.
+
+I do not suppose that, when a drunkard reasons with himself upon his
+
+vice, he is once out of five hundred times affected by the dangers that
+
+he runs through his brutish, physical insensibility; neither had I,
+
+long as I had considered my position, made enough allowance for the
+
+complete moral insensibility and insensate readiness to evil, which
+
+were the leading characters of Edward Hyde. Yet it was by these that I
+
+was punished. My devil had been long caged, he came out roaring. I was
+
+conscious, even when I took the draught, of a more unbridled, a more
+
+furious propensity to ill. It must have been this, I suppose, that
+
+stirred in my soul that tempest of impatience with which I listened to
+
+the civilities of my unhappy victim; I declare, at least, before God,
+
+no man morally sane could have been guilty of that crime upon so
+
+pitiful a provocation; and that I struck in no more reasonable spirit
+
+than that in which a sick child may break a plaything. But I had
+
+voluntarily stripped myself of all those balancing instincts by which
+
+even the worst of us continues to walk with some degree of steadiness
+
+among temptations; and in my case, to be tempted, however slightly, was
+
+to fall.
+
+Instantly the spirit of hell awoke in me and raged. With a transport of
+
+glee, I mauled the unresisting body, tasting delight from every blow;
+
+and it was not till weariness had begun to succeed, that I was
+
+suddenly, in the top fit of my delirium, struck through the heart by a
+
+cold thrill of terror. A mist dispersed; I saw my life to be forfeit;
+
+and fled from the scene of these excesses, at once glorying and
+
+trembling, my lust of evil gratified and stimulated, my love of life
+
+screwed to the topmost peg. I ran to the house in Soho, and (to make
+
+assurance doubly sure) destroyed my papers; thence I set out through
+
+the lamplit streets, in the same divided ecstasy of mind, gloating on
+
+my crime, light-headedly devising others in the future, and yet still
+
+hastening and still hearkening in my wake for the steps of the avenger.
+
+Hyde had a song upon his lips as he compounded the draught, and as he
+
+drank it, pledged the dead man. The pangs of transformation had not
+
+done tearing him, before Henry Jekyll, with streaming tears of
+
+gratitude and remorse, had fallen upon his knees and lifted his clasped
+
+hands to God. The veil of self-indulgence was rent from head to foot. I
+
+saw my life as a whole: I followed it up from the days of childhood,
+
+when I had walked with my father�s hand, and through the self-denying
+
+toils of my professional life, to arrive again and again, with the same
+
+sense of unreality, at the damned horrors of the evening. I could have
+
+screamed aloud; I sought with tears and prayers to smother down the
+
+crowd of hideous images and sounds with which my memory swarmed against
+
+me; and still, between the petitions, the ugly face of my iniquity
+
+stared into my soul. As the acuteness of this remorse began to die
+
+away, it was succeeded by a sense of joy. The problem of my conduct was
+
+solved. Hyde was thenceforth impossible; whether I would or not, I was
+
+now confined to the better part of my existence; and O, how I rejoiced
+
+to think of it! with what willing humility I embraced anew the
+
+restrictions of natural life! with what sincere renunciation I locked
+
+the door by which I had so often gone and come, and ground the key
+
+under my heel!
+
+The next day, came the news that the murder had not been overlooked,
+
+that the guilt of Hyde was patent to the world, and that the victim was
+
+a man high in public estimation. It was not only a crime, it had been a
+
+tragic folly. I think I was glad to know it; I think I was glad to have
+
+my better impulses thus buttressed and guarded by the terrors of the
+
+scaffold. Jekyll was now my city of refuge; let but Hyde peep out an
+
+instant, and the hands of all men would be raised to take and slay him.
+
+I resolved in my future conduct to redeem the past; and I can say with
+
+honesty that my resolve was fruitful of some good. You know yourself
+
+how earnestly, in the last months of the last year, I laboured to
+
+relieve suffering; you know that much was done for others, and that the
+
+days passed quietly, almost happily for myself. Nor can I truly say
+
+that I wearied of this beneficent and innocent life; I think instead
+
+that I daily enjoyed it more completely; but I was still cursed with my
+
+duality of purpose; and as the first edge of my penitence wore off, the
+
+lower side of me, so long indulged, so recently chained down, began to
+
+growl for licence. Not that I dreamed of resuscitating Hyde; the bare
+
+idea of that would startle me to frenzy: no, it was in my own person
+
+that I was once more tempted to trifle with my conscience; and it was
+
+as an ordinary secret sinner that I at last fell before the assaults of
+
+temptation.
+
+There comes an end to all things; the most capacious measure is filled
+
+at last; and this brief condescension to my evil finally destroyed the
+
+balance of my soul. And yet I was not alarmed; the fall seemed natural,
+
+like a return to the old days before I had made my discovery. It was a
+
+fine, clear, January day, wet under foot where the frost had melted,
+
+but cloudless overhead; and the Regent�s Park was full of winter
+
+chirrupings and sweet with spring odours. I sat in the sun on a bench;
+
+the animal within me licking the chops of memory; the spiritual side a
+
+little drowsed, promising subsequent penitence, but not yet moved to
+
+begin. After all, I reflected, I was like my neighbours; and then I
+
+smiled, comparing myself with other men, comparing my active good-will
+
+with the lazy cruelty of their neglect. And at the very moment of that
+
+vainglorious thought, a qualm came over me, a horrid nausea and the
+
+most deadly shuddering. These passed away, and left me faint; and then
+
+as in its turn faintness subsided, I began to be aware of a change in
+
+the temper of my thoughts, a greater boldness, a contempt of danger, a
+
+solution of the bonds of obligation. I looked down; my clothes hung
+
+formlessly on my shrunken limbs; the hand that lay on my knee was
+
+corded and hairy. I was once more Edward Hyde. A moment before I had
+
+been safe of all men�s respect, wealthy, beloved�the cloth laying for
+
+me in the dining-room at home; and now I was the common quarry of
+
+mankind, hunted, houseless, a known murderer, thrall to the gallows.
+
+My reason wavered, but it did not fail me utterly. I have more than
+
+once observed that in my second character, my faculties seemed
+
+sharpened to a point and my spirits more tensely elastic; thus it came
+
+about that, where Jekyll perhaps might have succumbed, Hyde rose to the
+
+importance of the moment. My drugs were in one of the presses of my
+
+cabinet; how was I to reach them? That was the problem that (crushing
+
+my temples in my hands) I set myself to solve. The laboratory door I
+
+had closed. If I sought to enter by the house, my own servants would
+
+consign me to the gallows. I saw I must employ another hand, and
+
+thought of Lanyon. How was he to be reached? how persuaded? Supposing
+
+that I escaped capture in the streets, how was I to make my way into
+
+his presence? and how should I, an unknown and displeasing visitor,
+
+prevail on the famous physician to rifle the study of his colleague,
+
+Dr. Jekyll? Then I remembered that of my original character, one part
+
+remained to me: I could write my own hand; and once I had conceived
+
+that kindling spark, the way that I must follow became lighted up from
+
+end to end.
+
+Thereupon, I arranged my clothes as best I could, and summoning a
+
+passing hansom, drove to an hotel in Portland Street, the name of which
+
+I chanced to remember. At my appearance (which was indeed comical
+
+enough, however tragic a fate these garments covered) the driver could
+
+not conceal his mirth. I gnashed my teeth upon him with a gust of
+
+devilish fury; and the smile withered from his face�happily for him�yet
+
+more happily for myself, for in another instant I had certainly dragged
+
+him from his perch. At the inn, as I entered, I looked about me with so
+
+black a countenance as made the attendants tremble; not a look did they
+
+exchange in my presence; but obsequiously took my orders, led me to a
+
+private room, and brought me wherewithal to write. Hyde in danger of
+
+his life was a creature new to me; shaken with inordinate anger, strung
+
+to the pitch of murder, lusting to inflict pain. Yet the creature was
+
+astute; mastered his fury with a great effort of the will; composed his
+
+two important letters, one to Lanyon and one to Poole; and that he
+
+might receive actual evidence of their being posted, sent them out with
+
+directions that they should be registered. Thenceforward, he sat all
+
+day over the fire in the private room, gnawing his nails; there he
+
+dined, sitting alone with his fears, the waiter visibly quailing before
+
+his eye; and thence, when the night was fully come, he set forth in the
+
+corner of a closed cab, and was driven to and fro about the streets of
+
+the city. He, I say�I cannot say, I. That child of Hell had nothing
+
+human; nothing lived in him but fear and hatred. And when at last,
+
+thinking the driver had begun to grow suspicious, he discharged the cab
+
+and ventured on foot, attired in his misfitting clothes, an object
+
+marked out for observation, into the midst of the nocturnal passengers,
+
+these two base passions raged within him like a tempest. He walked
+
+fast, hunted by his fears, chattering to himself, skulking through the
+
+less frequented thoroughfares, counting the minutes that still divided
+
+him from midnight. Once a woman spoke to him, offering, I think, a box
+
+of lights. He smote her in the face, and she fled.
+
+When I came to myself at Lanyon�s, the horror of my old friend perhaps
+
+affected me somewhat: I do not know; it was at least but a drop in the
+
+sea to the abhorrence with which I looked back upon these hours. A
+
+change had come over me. It was no longer the fear of the gallows, it
+
+was the horror of being Hyde that racked me. I received Lanyon�s
+
+condemnation partly in a dream; it was partly in a dream that I came
+
+home to my own house and got into bed. I slept after the prostration of
+
+the day, with a stringent and profound slumber which not even the
+
+nightmares that wrung me could avail to break. I awoke in the morning
+
+shaken, weakened, but refreshed. I still hated and feared the thought
+
+of the brute that slept within me, and I had not of course forgotten
+
+the appalling dangers of the day before; but I was once more at home,
+
+in my own house and close to my drugs; and gratitude for my escape
+
+shone so strong in my soul that it almost rivalled the brightness of
+
+hope.
+
+I was stepping leisurely across the court after breakfast, drinking the
+
+chill of the air with pleasure, when I was seized again with those
+
+indescribable sensations that heralded the change; and I had but the
+
+time to gain the shelter of my cabinet, before I was once again raging
+
+and freezing with the passions of Hyde. It took on this occasion a
+
+double dose to recall me to myself; and alas! six hours after, as I sat
+
+looking sadly in the fire, the pangs returned, and the drug had to be
+
+re-administered. In short, from that day forth it seemed only by a
+
+great effort as of gymnastics, and only under the immediate stimulation
+
+of the drug, that I was able to wear the countenance of Jekyll. At all
+
+hours of the day and night, I would be taken with the premonitory
+
+shudder; above all, if I slept, or even dozed for a moment in my chair,
+
+it was always as Hyde that I awakened. Under the strain of this
+
+continually impending doom and by the sleeplessness to which I now
+
+condemned myself, ay, even beyond what I had thought possible to man, I
+
+became, in my own person, a creature eaten up and emptied by fever,
+
+languidly weak both in body and mind, and solely occupied by one
+
+thought: the horror of my other self. But when I slept, or when the
+
+virtue of the medicine wore off, I would leap almost without transition
+
+(for the pangs of transformation grew daily less marked) into the
+
+possession of a fancy brimming with images of terror, a soul boiling
+
+with causeless hatreds, and a body that seemed not strong enough to
+
+contain the raging energies of life. The powers of Hyde seemed to have
+
+grown with the sickliness of Jekyll. And certainly the hate that now
+
+divided them was equal on each side. With Jekyll, it was a thing of
+
+vital instinct. He had now seen the full deformity of that creature
+
+that shared with him some of the phenomena of consciousness, and was
+
+co-heir with him to death: and beyond these links of community, which
+
+in themselves made the most poignant part of his distress, he thought
+
+of Hyde, for all his energy of life, as of something not only hellish
+
+but inorganic. This was the shocking thing; that the slime of the pit
+
+seemed to utter cries and voices; that the amorphous dust gesticulated
+
+and sinned; that what was dead, and had no shape, should usurp the
+
+offices of life. And this again, that that insurgent horror was knit to
+
+him closer than a wife, closer than an eye; lay caged in his flesh,
+
+where he heard it mutter and felt it struggle to be born; and at every
+
+hour of weakness, and in the confidence of slumber, prevailed against
+
+him, and deposed him out of life. The hatred of Hyde for Jekyll was of
+
+a different order. His terror of the gallows drove him continually to
+
+commit temporary suicide, and return to his subordinate station of a
+
+part instead of a person; but he loathed the necessity, he loathed the
+
+despondency into which Jekyll was now fallen, and he resented the
+
+dislike with which he was himself regarded. Hence the ape-like tricks
+
+that he would play me, scrawling in my own hand blasphemies on the
+
+pages of my books, burning the letters and destroying the portrait of
+
+my father; and indeed, had it not been for his fear of death, he would
+
+long ago have ruined himself in order to involve me in the ruin. But
+
+his love of life is wonderful; I go further: I, who sicken and freeze at
+
+the mere thought of him, when I recall the abjection and passion of
+
+this attachment, and when I know how he fears my power to cut him off
+
+by suicide, I find it in my heart to pity him.
+
+It is useless, and the time awfully fails me, to prolong this
+
+description; no one has ever suffered such torments, let that suffice;
+
+and yet even to these, habit brought�no, not alleviation�but a certain
+
+callousness of soul, a certain acquiescence of despair; and my
+
+punishment might have gone on for years, but for the last calamity
+
+which has now fallen, and which has finally severed me from my own face
+
+and nature. My provision of the salt, which had never been renewed
+
+since the date of the first experiment, began to run low. I sent out
+
+for a fresh supply and mixed the draught; the ebullition followed, and
+
+the first change of colour, not the second; I drank it and it was
+
+without efficiency. You will learn from Poole how I have had London
+
+ransacked; it was in vain; and I am now persuaded that my first supply
+
+was impure, and that it was that unknown impurity which lent efficacy
+
+to the draught.
+
+About a week has passed, and I am now finishing this statement under
+
+the influence of the last of the old powders. This, then, is the last
+
+time, short of a miracle, that Henry Jekyll can think his own thoughts
+
+or see his own face (now how sadly altered!) in the glass. Nor must I
+
+delay too long to bring my writing to an end; for if my narrative has
+
+hitherto escaped destruction, it has been by a combination of great
+
+prudence and great good luck. Should the throes of change take me in
+
+the act of writing it, Hyde will tear it in pieces; but if some time
+
+shall have elapsed after I have laid it by, his wonderful selfishness
+
+and circumscription to the moment will probably save it once again from
+
+the action of his ape-like spite. And indeed the doom that is closing
+
+on us both has already changed and crushed him. Half an hour from now,
+
+when I shall again and forever reindue that hated personality, I know
+
+how I shall sit shuddering and weeping in my chair, or continue, with
+
+the most strained and fearstruck ecstasy of listening, to pace up and
+
+down this room (my last earthly refuge) and give ear to every sound of
+
+menace. Will Hyde die upon the scaffold? or will he find courage to
+
+release himself at the last moment? God knows; I am careless; this is
+
+my true hour of death, and what is to follow concerns another than
+
+myself. Here then, as I lay down the pen and proceed to seal up my
+
+confession, I bring the life of that unhappy Henry Jekyll to an end.

+Chapter THE CAREW MURDER CASE
+
+Nearly a year later, in the month of October, 18�, London was startled
+
+by a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the more notable by
+
+the high position of the victim. The details were few and startling. A
+
+maid servant living alone in a house not far from the river, had gone
+
+upstairs to bed about eleven. Although a fog rolled over the city in
+
+the small hours, the early part of the night was cloudless, and the
+
+lane, which the maid�s window overlooked, was brilliantly lit by the
+
+full moon. It seems she was romantically given, for she sat down upon
+
+her box, which stood immediately under the window, and fell into a
+
+dream of musing. Never (she used to say, with streaming tears, when she
+
+narrated that experience), never had she felt more at peace with all
+
+men or thought more kindly of the world. And as she so sat she became
+
+aware of an aged beautiful gentleman with white hair, drawing near
+
+along the lane; and advancing to meet him, another and very small
+
+gentleman, to whom at first she paid less attention. When they had come
+
+within speech (which was just under the maid�s eyes) the older man
+
+bowed and accosted the other with a very pretty manner of politeness.
+
+It did not seem as if the subject of his address were of great
+
+importance; indeed, from his pointing, it sometimes appeared as if he
+
+were only inquiring his way; but the moon shone on his face as he
+
+spoke, and the girl was pleased to watch it, it seemed to breathe such
+
+an innocent and old-world kindness of disposition, yet with something
+
+high too, as of a well-founded self-content. Presently her eye wandered
+
+to the other, and she was surprised to recognise in him a certain Mr.
+
+Hyde, who had once visited her master and for whom she had conceived a
+
+dislike. He had in his hand a heavy cane, with which he was trifling;
+
+but he answered never a word, and seemed to listen with an
+
+ill-contained impatience. And then all of a sudden he broke out in a
+
+great flame of anger, stamping with his foot, brandishing the cane, and
+
+carrying on (as the maid described it) like a madman. The old gentleman
+
+took a step back, with the air of one very much surprised and a trifle
+
+hurt; and at that Mr. Hyde broke out of all bounds and clubbed him to
+
+the earth. And next moment, with ape-like fury, he was trampling his
+
+victim under foot and hailing down a storm of blows, under which the
+
+bones were audibly shattered and the body jumped upon the roadway. At
+
+the horror of these sights and sounds, the maid fainted.
+
+It was two o�clock when she came to herself and called for the police.
+
+The murderer was gone long ago; but there lay his victim in the middle
+
+of the lane, incredibly mangled. The stick with which the deed had been
+
+done, although it was of some rare and very tough and heavy wood, had
+
+broken in the middle under the stress of this insensate cruelty; and
+
+one splintered half had rolled in the neighbouring gutter�the other,
+
+without doubt, had been carried away by the murderer. A purse and gold
+
+watch were found upon the victim: but no cards or papers, except a
+
+sealed and stamped envelope, which he had been probably carrying to the
+
+post, and which bore the name and address of Mr. Utterson.
+
+This was brought to the lawyer the next morning, before he was out of
+
+bed; and he had no sooner seen it and been told the circumstances, than
+
+he shot out a solemn lip. �I shall say nothing till I have seen the
+
+body,� said he; �this may be very serious. Have the kindness to wait
+
+while I dress.� And with the same grave countenance he hurried through
+
+his breakfast and drove to the police station, whither the body had
+
+been carried. As soon as he came into the cell, he nodded.
+
+�Yes,� said he, �I recognise him. I am sorry to say that this is Sir
+
+Danvers Carew.�
+
+�Good God, sir,� exclaimed the officer, �is it possible?� And the next
+
+moment his eye lighted up with professional ambition. �This will make a
+
+deal of noise,� he said. �And perhaps you can help us to the man.� And
+
+he briefly narrated what the maid had seen, and showed the broken
+
+stick.
+
+Mr. Utterson had already quailed at the name of Hyde; but when the
+
+stick was laid before him, he could doubt no longer; broken and
+
+battered as it was, he recognised it for one that he had himself
+
+presented many years before to Henry Jekyll.
+
+�Is this Mr. Hyde a person of small stature?� he inquired.
+
+�Particularly small and particularly wicked-looking, is what the maid
+
+calls him,� said the officer.
+
+Mr. Utterson reflected; and then, raising his head, �If you will come
+
+with me in my cab,� he said, �I think I can take you to his house.�
+
+It was by this time about nine in the morning, and the first fog of the
+
+season. A great chocolate-coloured pall lowered over heaven, but the
+
+wind was continually charging and routing these embattled vapours; so
+
+that as the cab crawled from street to street, Mr. Utterson beheld a
+
+marvelous number of degrees and hues of twilight; for here it would be
+
+dark like the back-end of evening; and there would be a glow of a rich,
+
+lurid brown, like the light of some strange conflagration; and here,
+
+for a moment, the fog would be quite broken up, and a haggard shaft of
+
+daylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths. The dismal
+
+quarter of Soho seen under these changing glimpses, with its muddy
+
+ways, and slatternly passengers, and its lamps, which had never been
+
+extinguished or had been kindled afresh to combat this mournful
+
+reinvasion of darkness, seemed, in the lawyer�s eyes, like a district
+
+of some city in a nightmare. The thoughts of his mind, besides, were of
+
+the gloomiest dye; and when he glanced at the companion of his drive,
+
+he was conscious of some touch of that terror of the law and the law�s
+
+officers, which may at times assail the most honest.
+
+As the cab drew up before the address indicated, the fog lifted a
+
+little and showed him a dingy street, a gin palace, a low French eating
+
+house, a shop for the retail of penny numbers and twopenny salads, many
+
+ragged children huddled in the doorways, and many women of many
+
+different nationalities passing out, key in hand, to have a morning
+
+glass; and the next moment the fog settled down again upon that part,
+
+as brown as umber, and cut him off from his blackguardly surroundings.
+
+This was the home of Henry Jekyll�s favourite; of a man who was heir to
+
+a quarter of a million sterling.
+
+An ivory-faced and silvery-haired old woman opened the door. She had an
+
+evil face, smoothed by hypocrisy: but her manners were excellent. Yes,
+
+she said, this was Mr. Hyde�s, but he was not at home; he had been in
+
+that night very late, but he had gone away again in less than an hour;
+
+there was nothing strange in that; his habits were very irregular, and
+
+he was often absent; for instance, it was nearly two months since she
+
+had seen him till yesterday.
+
+�Very well, then, we wish to see his rooms,� said the lawyer; and when
+
+the woman began to declare it was impossible, �I had better tell you
+
+who this person is,� he added. �This is Inspector Newcomen of Scotland
+
+Yard.�
+
+A flash of odious joy appeared upon the woman�s face. �Ah!� said she,
+
+�he is in trouble! What has he done?�
+
+Mr. Utterson and the inspector exchanged glances. �He don�t seem a very
+
+popular character,� observed the latter. �And now, my good woman, just
+
+let me and this gentleman have a look about us.�
+
+In the whole extent of the house, which but for the old woman remained
+
+otherwise empty, Mr. Hyde had only used a couple of rooms; but these
+
+were furnished with luxury and good taste. A closet was filled with
+
+wine; the plate was of silver, the napery elegant; a good picture hung
+
+upon the walls, a gift (as Utterson supposed) from Henry Jekyll, who
+
+was much of a connoisseur; and the carpets were of many plies and
+
+agreeable in colour. At this moment, however, the rooms bore every mark
+
+of having been recently and hurriedly ransacked; clothes lay about the
+
+floor, with their pockets inside out; lock-fast drawers stood open; and
+
+on the hearth there lay a pile of grey ashes, as though many papers had
+
+been burned. From these embers the inspector disinterred the butt end
+
+of a green cheque book, which had resisted the action of the fire; the
+
+other half of the stick was found behind the door; and as this clinched
+
+his suspicions, the officer declared himself delighted. A visit to the
+
+bank, where several thousand pounds were found to be lying to the
+
+murderer�s credit, completed his gratification.
+
+�You may depend upon it, sir,� he told Mr. Utterson: �I have him in my
+
+hand. He must have lost his head, or he never would have left the stick
+
+or, above all, burned the cheque book. Why, money�s life to the man. We
+
+have nothing to do but wait for him at the bank, and get out the
+
+handbills.�
+
+This last, however, was not so easy of accomplishment; for Mr. Hyde had
+
+numbered few familiars�even the master of the servant maid had only
+
+seen him twice; his family could nowhere be traced; he had never been
+
+photographed; and the few who could describe him differed widely, as
+
+common observers will. Only on one point were they agreed; and that was
+
+the haunting sense of unexpressed deformity with which the fugitive
+
+impressed his beholders.

+Chapter THE LAST NIGHT
+
+Mr. Utterson was sitting by his fireside one evening after dinner, when
+
+he was surprised to receive a visit from Poole.
+
+�Bless me, Poole, what brings you here?� he cried; and then taking a
+
+second look at him, �What ails you?� he added; �is the doctor ill?�
+
+�Mr. Utterson,� said the man, �there is something wrong.�
+
+�Take a seat, and here is a glass of wine for you,� said the lawyer.
+
+�Now, take your time, and tell me plainly what you want.�
+
+�You know the doctor�s ways, sir,� replied Poole, �and how he shuts
+
+himself up. Well, he�s shut up again in the cabinet; and I don�t like
+
+it, sir�I wish I may die if I like it. Mr. Utterson, sir, I�m afraid.�
+
+�Now, my good man,� said the lawyer, �be explicit. What are you afraid
+
+of?�
+
+�I�ve been afraid for about a week,� returned Poole, doggedly
+
+disregarding the question, �and I can bear it no more.�
+
+The man�s appearance amply bore out his words; his manner was altered
+
+for the worse; and except for the moment when he had first announced
+
+his terror, he had not once looked the lawyer in the face. Even now, he
+
+sat with the glass of wine untasted on his knee, and his eyes directed
+
+to a corner of the floor. �I can bear it no more,� he repeated.
+
+�Come,� said the lawyer, �I see you have some good reason, Poole; I see
+
+there is something seriously amiss. Try to tell me what it is.�
+
+�I think there�s been foul play,� said Poole, hoarsely.
+
+�Foul play!� cried the lawyer, a good deal frightened and rather
+
+inclined to be irritated in consequence. �What foul play! What does the
+
+man mean?�
+
+�I daren�t say, sir,� was the answer; �but will you come along with me
+
+and see for yourself?�
+
+Mr. Utterson�s only answer was to rise and get his hat and greatcoat;
+
+but he observed with wonder the greatness of the relief that appeared
+
+upon the butler�s face, and perhaps with no less, that the wine was
+
+still untasted when he set it down to follow.
+
+It was a wild, cold, seasonable night of March, with a pale moon, lying
+
+on her back as though the wind had tilted her, and flying wrack of the
+
+most diaphanous and lawny texture. The wind made talking difficult, and
+
+flecked the blood into the face. It seemed to have swept the streets
+
+unusually bare of passengers, besides; for Mr. Utterson thought he had
+
+never seen that part of London so deserted. He could have wished it
+
+otherwise; never in his life had he been conscious of so sharp a wish
+
+to see and touch his fellow-creatures; for struggle as he might, there
+
+was borne in upon his mind a crushing anticipation of calamity. The
+
+square, when they got there, was full of wind and dust, and the thin
+
+trees in the garden were lashing themselves along the railing. Poole,
+
+who had kept all the way a pace or two ahead, now pulled up in the
+
+middle of the pavement, and in spite of the biting weather, took off
+
+his hat and mopped his brow with a red pocket-handkerchief. But for all
+
+the hurry of his coming, these were not the dews of exertion that he
+
+wiped away, but the moisture of some strangling anguish; for his face
+
+was white and his voice, when he spoke, harsh and broken.
+
+�Well, sir,� he said, �here we are, and God grant there be nothing
+
+wrong.�
+
+�Amen, Poole,� said the lawyer.
+
+Thereupon the servant knocked in a very guarded manner; the door was
+
+opened on the chain; and a voice asked from within, �Is that you,
+
+Poole?�
+
+�It�s all right,� said Poole. �Open the door.�
+
+The hall, when they entered it, was brightly lighted up; the fire was
+
+built high; and about the hearth the whole of the servants, men and
+
+women, stood huddled together like a flock of sheep. At the sight of
+
+Mr. Utterson, the housemaid broke into hysterical whimpering; and the
+
+cook, crying out �Bless God! it�s Mr. Utterson,� ran forward as if to
+
+take him in her arms.
+
+�What, what? Are you all here?� said the lawyer peevishly. �Very
+
+irregular, very unseemly; your master would be far from pleased.�
+
+�They�re all afraid,� said Poole.
+
+Blank silence followed, no one protesting; only the maid lifted her
+
+voice and now wept loudly.
+
+�Hold your tongue!� Poole said to her, with a ferocity of accent that
+
+testified to his own jangled nerves; and indeed, when the girl had so
+
+suddenly raised the note of her lamentation, they had all started and
+
+turned towards the inner door with faces of dreadful expectation. �And
+
+now,� continued the butler, addressing the knife-boy, �reach me a
+
+candle, and we�ll get this through hands at once.� And then he begged
+
+Mr. Utterson to follow him, and led the way to the back garden.
+
+�Now, sir,� said he, �you come as gently as you can. I want you to
+
+hear, and I don�t want you to be heard. And see here, sir, if by any
+
+chance he was to ask you in, don�t go.�
+
+Mr. Utterson�s nerves, at this unlooked-for termination, gave a jerk
+
+that nearly threw him from his balance; but he recollected his courage
+
+and followed the butler into the laboratory building through the
+
+surgical theatre, with its lumber of crates and bottles, to the foot of
+
+the stair. Here Poole motioned him to stand on one side and listen;
+
+while he himself, setting down the candle and making a great and
+
+obvious call on his resolution, mounted the steps and knocked with a
+
+somewhat uncertain hand on the red baize of the cabinet door.
+
+�Mr. Utterson, sir, asking to see you,� he called; and even as he did
+
+so, once more violently signed to the lawyer to give ear.
+
+A voice answered from within: �Tell him I cannot see anyone,� it said
+
+complainingly.
+
+�Thank you, sir,� said Poole, with a note of something like triumph in
+
+his voice; and taking up his candle, he led Mr. Utterson back across
+
+the yard and into the great kitchen, where the fire was out and the
+
+beetles were leaping on the floor.
+
+�Sir,� he said, looking Mr. Utterson in the eyes, �Was that my master�s
+
+voice?�
+
+�It seems much changed,� replied the lawyer, very pale, but giving look
+
+for look.
+
+�Changed? Well, yes, I think so,� said the butler. �Have I been twenty
+
+years in this man�s house, to be deceived about his voice? No, sir;
+
+master�s made away with; he was made away with eight days ago, when we
+
+heard him cry out upon the name of God; and _who�s_ in there instead of
+
+him, and _why_ it stays there, is a thing that cries to Heaven, Mr.
+
+Utterson!�
+
+�This is a very strange tale, Poole; this is rather a wild tale my
+
+man,� said Mr. Utterson, biting his finger. �Suppose it were as you
+
+suppose, supposing Dr. Jekyll to have been�well, murdered, what could
+
+induce the murderer to stay? That won�t hold water; it doesn�t commend
+
+itself to reason.�
+
+�Well, Mr. Utterson, you are a hard man to satisfy, but I�ll do it
+
+yet,� said Poole. �All this last week (you must know) him, or it,
+
+whatever it is that lives in that cabinet, has been crying night and
+
+day for some sort of medicine and cannot get it to his mind. It was
+
+sometimes his way�the master�s, that is�to write his orders on a sheet
+
+of paper and throw it on the stair. We�ve had nothing else this week
+
+back; nothing but papers, and a closed door, and the very meals left
+
+there to be smuggled in when nobody was looking. Well, sir, every day,
+
+ay, and twice and thrice in the same day, there have been orders and
+
+complaints, and I have been sent flying to all the wholesale chemists
+
+in town. Every time I brought the stuff back, there would be another
+
+paper telling me to return it, because it was not pure, and another
+
+order to a different firm. This drug is wanted bitter bad, sir,
+
+whatever for.�
+
+�Have you any of these papers?� asked Mr. Utterson.
+
+Poole felt in his pocket and handed out a crumpled note, which the
+
+lawyer, bending nearer to the candle, carefully examined. Its contents
+
+ran thus: �Dr. Jekyll presents his compliments to Messrs. Maw. He
+
+assures them that their last sample is impure and quite useless for his
+
+present purpose. In the year 18�, Dr. J. purchased a somewhat large
+
+quantity from Messrs. M. He now begs them to search with most sedulous
+
+care, and should any of the same quality be left, forward it to him at
+
+once. Expense is no consideration. The importance of this to Dr. J. can
+
+hardly be exaggerated.� So far the letter had run composedly enough,
+
+but here with a sudden splutter of the pen, the writer�s emotion had
+
+broken loose. �For God�s sake,� he added, �find me some of the old.�
+
+�This is a strange note,� said Mr. Utterson; and then sharply, �How do
+
+you come to have it open?�
+
+�The man at Maw�s was main angry, sir, and he threw it back to me like
+
+so much dirt,� returned Poole.
+
+�This is unquestionably the doctor�s hand, do you know?� resumed the
+
+lawyer.
+
+�I thought it looked like it,� said the servant rather sulkily; and
+
+then, with another voice, �But what matters hand of write?� he said.
+
+�I�ve seen him!�
+
+�Seen him?� repeated Mr. Utterson. �Well?�
+
+�That�s it!� said Poole. �It was this way. I came suddenly into the
+
+theatre from the garden. It seems he had slipped out to look for this
+
+drug or whatever it is; for the cabinet door was open, and there he was
+
+at the far end of the room digging among the crates. He looked up when
+
+I came in, gave a kind of cry, and whipped upstairs into the cabinet.
+
+It was but for one minute that I saw him, but the hair stood upon my
+
+head like quills. Sir, if that was my master, why had he a mask upon
+
+his face? If it was my master, why did he cry out like a rat, and run
+
+from me? I have served him long enough. And then...� The man paused and
+
+passed his hand over his face.
+
+�These are all very strange circumstances,� said Mr. Utterson, �but I
+
+think I begin to see daylight. Your master, Poole, is plainly seized
+
+with one of those maladies that both torture and deform the sufferer;
+
+hence, for aught I know, the alteration of his voice; hence the mask
+
+and the avoidance of his friends; hence his eagerness to find this
+
+drug, by means of which the poor soul retains some hope of ultimate
+
+recovery�God grant that he be not deceived! There is my explanation; it
+
+is sad enough, Poole, ay, and appalling to consider; but it is plain
+
+and natural, hangs well together, and delivers us from all exorbitant
+
+alarms.�
+
+�Sir,� said the butler, turning to a sort of mottled pallor, �that
+
+thing was not my master, and there�s the truth. My master��here he
+
+looked round him and began to whisper��is a tall, fine build of a man,
+
+and this was more of a dwarf.� Utterson attempted to protest. �O, sir,�
+
+cried Poole, �do you think I do not know my master after twenty years?
+
+Do you think I do not know where his head comes to in the cabinet door,
+
+where I saw him every morning of my life? No, sir, that thing in the
+
+mask was never Dr. Jekyll�God knows what it was, but it was never Dr.
+
+Jekyll; and it is the belief of my heart that there was murder done.�
+
+�Poole,� replied the lawyer, �if you say that, it will become my duty
+
+to make certain. Much as I desire to spare your master�s feelings, much
+
+as I am puzzled by this note which seems to prove him to be still
+
+alive, I shall consider it my duty to break in that door.�
+
+�Ah, Mr. Utterson, that�s talking!� cried the butler.
+
+�And now comes the second question,� resumed Utterson: �Who is going to
+
+do it?�
+
+�Why, you and me, sir,� was the undaunted reply.
+
+�That�s very well said,� returned the lawyer; �and whatever comes of
+
+it, I shall make it my business to see you are no loser.�
+
+�There is an axe in the theatre,� continued Poole; �and you might take
+
+the kitchen poker for yourself.�
+
+The lawyer took that rude but weighty instrument into his hand, and
+
+balanced it. �Do you know, Poole,� he said, looking up, �that you and I
+
+are about to place ourselves in a position of some peril?�
+
+�You may say so, sir, indeed,� returned the butler.
+
+�It is well, then that we should be frank,� said the other. �We both
+
+think more than we have said; let us make a clean breast. This masked
+
+figure that you saw, did you recognise it?�
+
+�Well, sir, it went so quick, and the creature was so doubled up, that
+
+I could hardly swear to that,� was the answer. �But if you mean, was it
+
+Mr. Hyde?�why, yes, I think it was! You see, it was much of the same
+
+bigness; and it had the same quick, light way with it; and then who
+
+else could have got in by the laboratory door? You have not forgot,
+
+sir, that at the time of the murder he had still the key with him? But
+
+that�s not all. I don�t know, Mr. Utterson, if you ever met this Mr.
+
+Hyde?�
+
+�Yes,� said the lawyer, �I once spoke with him.�
+
+�Then you must know as well as the rest of us that there was something
+
+queer about that gentleman�something that gave a man a turn�I don�t
+
+know rightly how to say it, sir, beyond this: that you felt in your
+
+marrow kind of cold and thin.�
+
+�I own I felt something of what you describe,� said Mr. Utterson.
+
+�Quite so, sir,� returned Poole. �Well, when that masked thing like a
+
+monkey jumped from among the chemicals and whipped into the cabinet, it
+
+went down my spine like ice. O, I know it�s not evidence, Mr. Utterson;
+
+I�m book-learned enough for that; but a man has his feelings, and I
+
+give you my bible-word it was Mr. Hyde!�
+
+�Ay, ay,� said the lawyer. �My fears incline to the same point. Evil, I
+
+fear, founded�evil was sure to come�of that connection. Ay truly, I
+
+believe you; I believe poor Harry is killed; and I believe his murderer
+
+(for what purpose, God alone can tell) is still lurking in his victim�s
+
+room. Well, let our name be vengeance. Call Bradshaw.�
+
+The footman came at the summons, very white and nervous.
+
+�Pull yourself together, Bradshaw,� said the lawyer. �This suspense, I
+
+know, is telling upon all of you; but it is now our intention to make
+
+an end of it. Poole, here, and I are going to force our way into the
+
+cabinet. If all is well, my shoulders are broad enough to bear the
+
+blame. Meanwhile, lest anything should really be amiss, or any
+
+malefactor seek to escape by the back, you and the boy must go round
+
+the corner with a pair of good sticks and take your post at the
+
+laboratory door. We give you ten minutes to get to your stations.�
+
+As Bradshaw left, the lawyer looked at his watch. �And now, Poole, let
+
+us get to ours,� he said; and taking the poker under his arm, led the
+
+way into the yard. The scud had banked over the moon, and it was now
+
+quite dark. The wind, which only broke in puffs and draughts into that
+
+deep well of building, tossed the light of the candle to and fro about
+
+their steps, until they came into the shelter of the theatre, where
+
+they sat down silently to wait. London hummed solemnly all around; but
+
+nearer at hand, the stillness was only broken by the sounds of a
+
+footfall moving to and fro along the cabinet floor.
+
+�So it will walk all day, sir,� whispered Poole; �ay, and the better
+
+part of the night. Only when a new sample comes from the chemist,
+
+there�s a bit of a break. Ah, it�s an ill conscience that�s such an
+
+enemy to rest! Ah, sir, there�s blood foully shed in every step of it!
+
+But hark again, a little closer�put your heart in your ears, Mr.
+
+Utterson, and tell me, is that the doctor�s foot?�
+
+The steps fell lightly and oddly, with a certain swing, for all they
+
+went so slowly; it was different indeed from the heavy creaking tread
+
+of Henry Jekyll. Utterson sighed. �Is there never anything else?� he
+
+asked.
+
+Poole nodded. �Once,� he said. �Once I heard it weeping!�
+
+�Weeping? how that?� said the lawyer, conscious of a sudden chill of
+
+horror.
+
+�Weeping like a woman or a lost soul,� said the butler. �I came away
+
+with that upon my heart, that I could have wept too.�
+
+But now the ten minutes drew to an end. Poole disinterred the axe from
+
+under a stack of packing straw; the candle was set upon the nearest
+
+table to light them to the attack; and they drew near with bated breath
+
+to where that patient foot was still going up and down, up and down, in
+
+the quiet of the night.
+
+�Jekyll,� cried Utterson, with a loud voice, �I demand to see you.� He
+
+paused a moment, but there came no reply. �I give you fair warning, our
+
+suspicions are aroused, and I must and shall see you,� he resumed; �if
+
+not by fair means, then by foul�if not of your consent, then by brute
+
+force!�
+
+�Utterson,� said the voice, �for God�s sake, have mercy!�
+
+�Ah, that�s not Jekyll�s voice�it�s Hyde�s!� cried Utterson. �Down with
+
+the door, Poole!�
+
+Poole swung the axe over his shoulder; the blow shook the building, and
+
+the red baize door leaped against the lock and hinges. A dismal
+
+screech, as of mere animal terror, rang from the cabinet. Up went the
+
+axe again, and again the panels crashed and the frame bounded; four
+
+times the blow fell; but the wood was tough and the fittings were of
+
+excellent workmanship; and it was not until the fifth, that the lock
+
+burst and the wreck of the door fell inwards on the carpet.
+
+The besiegers, appalled by their own riot and the stillness that had
+
+succeeded, stood back a little and peered in. There lay the cabinet
+
+before their eyes in the quiet lamplight, a good fire glowing and
+
+chattering on the hearth, the kettle singing its thin strain, a drawer
+
+or two open, papers neatly set forth on the business table, and nearer
+
+the fire, the things laid out for tea; the quietest room, you would
+
+have said, and, but for the glazed presses full of chemicals, the most
+
+commonplace that night in London.
+
+Right in the middle there lay the body of a man sorely contorted and
+
+still twitching. They drew near on tiptoe, turned it on its back and
+
+beheld the face of Edward Hyde. He was dressed in clothes far too large
+
+for him, clothes of the doctor�s bigness; the cords of his face still
+
+moved with a semblance of life, but life was quite gone; and by the
+
+crushed phial in the hand and the strong smell of kernels that hung
+
+upon the air, Utterson knew that he was looking on the body of a
+
+self-destroyer.
+
+�We have come too late,� he said sternly, �whether to save or punish.
+
+Hyde is gone to his account; and it only remains for us to find the
+
+body of your master.�
+
+The far greater proportion of the building was occupied by the theatre,
+
+which filled almost the whole ground storey and was lighted from above,
+
+and by the cabinet, which formed an upper storey at one end and looked
+
+upon the court. A corridor joined the theatre to the door on the
+
+by-street; and with this the cabinet communicated separately by a
+
+second flight of stairs. There were besides a few dark closets and a
+
+spacious cellar. All these they now thoroughly examined. Each closet
+
+needed but a glance, for all were empty, and all, by the dust that fell
+
+from their doors, had stood long unopened. The cellar, indeed, was
+
+filled with crazy lumber, mostly dating from the times of the surgeon
+
+who was Jekyll�s predecessor; but even as they opened the door they
+
+were advertised of the uselessness of further search, by the fall of a
+
+perfect mat of cobweb which had for years sealed up the entrance.
+
+Nowhere was there any trace of Henry Jekyll, dead or alive.
+
+Poole stamped on the flags of the corridor. �He must be buried here,�
+
+he said, hearkening to the sound.
+
+�Or he may have fled,� said Utterson, and he turned to examine the door
+
+in the by-street. It was locked; and lying near by on the flags, they
+
+found the key, already stained with rust.
+
+�This does not look like use,� observed the lawyer.
+
+�Use!� echoed Poole. �Do you not see, sir, it is broken? much as if a
+
+man had stamped on it.�
+
+�Ay,� continued Utterson, �and the fractures, too, are rusty.� The two
+
+men looked at each other with a scare. �This is beyond me, Poole,� said
+
+the lawyer. �Let us go back to the cabinet.�
+
+They mounted the stair in silence, and still with an occasional
+
+awestruck glance at the dead body, proceeded more thoroughly to examine
+
+the contents of the cabinet. At one table, there were traces of
+
+chemical work, various measured heaps of some white salt being laid on
+
+glass saucers, as though for an experiment in which the unhappy man had
+
+been prevented.
+
+�That is the same drug that I was always bringing him,� said Poole; and
+
+even as he spoke, the kettle with a startling noise boiled over.
+
+This brought them to the fireside, where the easy-chair was drawn
+
+cosily up, and the tea things stood ready to the sitter�s elbow, the
+
+very sugar in the cup. There were several books on a shelf; one lay
+
+beside the tea things open, and Utterson was amazed to find it a copy
+
+of a pious work, for which Jekyll had several times expressed a great
+
+esteem, annotated, in his own hand with startling blasphemies.
+
+Next, in the course of their review of the chamber, the searchers came
+
+to the cheval-glass, into whose depths they looked with an involuntary
+
+horror. But it was so turned as to show them nothing but the rosy glow
+
+playing on the roof, the fire sparkling in a hundred repetitions along
+
+the glazed front of the presses, and their own pale and fearful
+
+countenances stooping to look in.
+
+�This glass has seen some strange things, sir,� whispered Poole.
+
+�And surely none stranger than itself,� echoed the lawyer in the same
+
+tones. �For what did Jekyll��he caught himself up at the word with a
+
+start, and then conquering the weakness��what could Jekyll want with
+
+it?� he said.
+
+�You may say that!� said Poole.
+
+Next they turned to the business table. On the desk, among the neat
+
+array of papers, a large envelope was uppermost, and bore, in the
+
+doctor�s hand, the name of Mr. Utterson. The lawyer unsealed it, and
+
+several enclosures fell to the floor. The first was a will, drawn in
+
+the same eccentric terms as the one which he had returned six months
+
+before, to serve as a testament in case of death and as a deed of gift
+
+in case of disappearance; but in place of the name of Edward Hyde, the
+
+lawyer, with indescribable amazement read the name of Gabriel John
+
+Utterson. He looked at Poole, and then back at the paper, and last of
+
+all at the dead malefactor stretched upon the carpet.
+
+�My head goes round,� he said. �He has been all these days in
+
+possession; he had no cause to like me; he must have raged to see
+
+himself displaced; and he has not destroyed this document.�
+
+He caught up the next paper; it was a brief note in the doctor�s hand
+
+and dated at the top. �O Poole!� the lawyer cried, �he was alive and
+
+here this day. He cannot have been disposed of in so short a space; he
+
+must be still alive, he must have fled! And then, why fled? and how?
+
+and in that case, can we venture to declare this suicide? O, we must be
+
+careful. I foresee that we may yet involve your master in some dire
+
+catastrophe.�
+
+�Why don�t you read it, sir?� asked Poole.
+
+�Because I fear,� replied the lawyer solemnly. �God grant I have no
+
+cause for it!� And with that he brought the paper to his eyes and read
+
+as follows:
+
+�My dear Utterson,�When this shall fall into your hands, I shall have
+
+disappeared, under what circumstances I have not the penetration to
+
+foresee, but my instinct and all the circumstances of my nameless
+
+situation tell me that the end is sure and must be early. Go then, and
+
+first read the narrative which Lanyon warned me he was to place in your
+
+hands; and if you care to hear more, turn to the confession of
+
+�Your unworthy and unhappy friend,
+
+�HENRY JEKYLL.�
+
+�There was a third enclosure?� asked Utterson.
+
+�Here, sir,� said Poole, and gave into his hands a considerable packet
+
+sealed in several places.
+
+The lawyer put it in his pocket. �I would say nothing of this paper. If
+
+your master has fled or is dead, we may at least save his credit. It is
+
+now ten; I must go home and read these documents in quiet; but I shall
+
+be back before midnight, when we shall send for the police.�
+
+They went out, locking the door of the theatre behind them; and
+
+Utterson, once more leaving the servants gathered about the fire in the
+
+hall, trudged back to his office to read the two narratives in which
+
+this mystery was now to be explained.

+Chapter STORY OF THE DOOR
+
+Mr. Utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that was
+
+never lighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse;
+
+backward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow
+
+lovable. At friendly meetings, and when the wine was to his taste,
+
+something eminently human beaconed from his eye; something indeed which
+
+never found its way into his talk, but which spoke not only in these
+
+silent symbols of the after-dinner face, but more often and loudly in
+
+the acts of his life. He was austere with himself; drank gin when he
+
+was alone, to mortify a taste for vintages; and though he enjoyed the
+
+theatre, had not crossed the doors of one for twenty years. But he had
+
+an approved tolerance for others; sometimes wondering, almost with
+
+envy, at the high pressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds; and
+
+in any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove. �I incline to
+
+Cain�s heresy,� he used to say quaintly: �I let my brother go to the
+
+devil in his own way.� In this character, it was frequently his fortune
+
+to be the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influence in
+
+the lives of downgoing men. And to such as these, so long as they came
+
+about his chambers, he never marked a shade of change in his demeanour.
+
+No doubt the feat was easy to Mr. Utterson; for he was undemonstrative
+
+at the best, and even his friendship seemed to be founded in a similar
+
+catholicity of good-nature. It is the mark of a modest man to accept
+
+his friendly circle ready-made from the hands of opportunity; and that
+
+was the lawyer�s way. His friends were those of his own blood or those
+
+whom he had known the longest; his affections, like ivy, were the
+
+growth of time, they implied no aptness in the object. Hence, no doubt
+
+the bond that united him to Mr. Richard Enfield, his distant kinsman,
+
+the well-known man about town. It was a nut to crack for many, what
+
+these two could see in each other, or what subject they could find in
+
+common. It was reported by those who encountered them in their Sunday
+
+walks, that they said nothing, looked singularly dull and would hail
+
+with obvious relief the appearance of a friend. For all that, the two
+
+men put the greatest store by these excursions, counted them the chief
+
+jewel of each week, and not only set aside occasions of pleasure, but
+
+even resisted the calls of business, that they might enjoy them
+
+uninterrupted.
+
+It chanced on one of these rambles that their way led them down a
+
+by-street in a busy quarter of London. The street was small and what is
+
+called quiet, but it drove a thriving trade on the weekdays. The
+
+inhabitants were all doing well, it seemed and all emulously hoping to
+
+do better still, and laying out the surplus of their grains in
+
+coquetry; so that the shop fronts stood along that thoroughfare with an
+
+air of invitation, like rows of smiling saleswomen. Even on Sunday,
+
+when it veiled its more florid charms and lay comparatively empty of
+
+passage, the street shone out in contrast to its dingy neighbourhood,
+
+like a fire in a forest; and with its freshly painted shutters,
+
+well-polished brasses, and general cleanliness and gaiety of note,
+
+instantly caught and pleased the eye of the passenger.
+
+Two doors from one corner, on the left hand going east the line was
+
+broken by the entry of a court; and just at that point a certain
+
+sinister block of building thrust forward its gable on the street. It
+
+was two storeys high; showed no window, nothing but a door on the lower
+
+storey and a blind forehead of discoloured wall on the upper; and bore
+
+in every feature, the marks of prolonged and sordid negligence. The
+
+door, which was equipped with neither bell nor knocker, was blistered
+
+and distained. Tramps slouched into the recess and struck matches on
+
+the panels; children kept shop upon the steps; the schoolboy had tried
+
+his knife on the mouldings; and for close on a generation, no one had
+
+appeared to drive away these random visitors or to repair their
+
+ravages.
+
+Mr. Enfield and the lawyer were on the other side of the by-street; but
+
+when they came abreast of the entry, the former lifted up his cane and
+
+pointed.
+
+�Did you ever remark that door?� he asked; and when his companion had
+
+replied in the affirmative, �It is connected in my mind,� added he,
+
+�with a very odd story.�
+
+�Indeed?� said Mr. Utterson, with a slight change of voice, �and what
+
+was that?�
+
+�Well, it was this way,� returned Mr. Enfield: �I was coming home from
+
+some place at the end of the world, about three o�clock of a black
+
+winter morning, and my way lay through a part of town where there was
+
+literally nothing to be seen but lamps. Street after street and all the
+
+folks asleep�street after street, all lighted up as if for a procession
+
+and all as empty as a church�till at last I got into that state of mind
+
+when a man listens and listens and begins to long for the sight of a
+
+policeman. All at once, I saw two figures: one a little man who was
+
+stumping along eastward at a good walk, and the other a girl of maybe
+
+eight or ten who was running as hard as she was able down a cross
+
+street. Well, sir, the two ran into one another naturally enough at the
+
+corner; and then came the horrible part of the thing; for the man
+
+trampled calmly over the child�s body and left her screaming on the
+
+ground. It sounds nothing to hear, but it was hellish to see. It wasn�t
+
+like a man; it was like some damned Juggernaut. I gave a few halloa,
+
+took to my heels, collared my gentleman, and brought him back to where
+
+there was already quite a group about the screaming child. He was
+
+perfectly cool and made no resistance, but gave me one look, so ugly
+
+that it brought out the sweat on me like running. The people who had
+
+turned out were the girl�s own family; and pretty soon, the doctor, for
+
+whom she had been sent put in his appearance. Well, the child was not
+
+much the worse, more frightened, according to the sawbones; and there
+
+you might have supposed would be an end to it. But there was one
+
+curious circumstance. I had taken a loathing to my gentleman at first
+
+sight. So had the child�s family, which was only natural. But the
+
+doctor�s case was what struck me. He was the usual cut and dry
+
+apothecary, of no particular age and colour, with a strong Edinburgh
+
+accent and about as emotional as a bagpipe. Well, sir, he was like the
+
+rest of us; every time he looked at my prisoner, I saw that sawbones
+
+turn sick and white with the desire to kill him. I knew what was in his
+
+mind, just as he knew what was in mine; and killing being out of the
+
+question, we did the next best. We told the man we could and would make
+
+such a scandal out of this as should make his name stink from one end
+
+of London to the other. If he had any friends or any credit, we
+
+undertook that he should lose them. And all the time, as we were
+
+pitching it in red hot, we were keeping the women off him as best we
+
+could for they were as wild as harpies. I never saw a circle of such
+
+hateful faces; and there was the man in the middle, with a kind of
+
+black sneering coolness�frightened too, I could see that�but carrying
+
+it off, sir, really like Satan. �If you choose to make capital out of
+
+this accident,� said he, �I am naturally helpless. No gentleman but
+
+wishes to avoid a scene,� says he. �Name your figure.� Well, we screwed
+
+him up to a hundred pounds for the child�s family; he would have
+
+clearly liked to stick out; but there was something about the lot of us
+
+that meant mischief, and at last he struck. The next thing was to get
+
+the money; and where do you think he carried us but to that place with
+
+the door?�whipped out a key, went in, and presently came back with the
+
+matter of ten pounds in gold and a cheque for the balance on Coutts�s,
+
+drawn payable to bearer and signed with a name that I can�t mention,
+
+though it�s one of the points of my story, but it was a name at least
+
+very well known and often printed. The figure was stiff; but the
+
+signature was good for more than that if it was only genuine. I took
+
+the liberty of pointing out to my gentleman that the whole business
+
+looked apocryphal, and that a man does not, in real life, walk into a
+
+cellar door at four in the morning and come out with another man�s
+
+cheque for close upon a hundred pounds. But he was quite easy and
+
+sneering. �Set your mind at rest,� says he, �I will stay with you till
+
+the banks open and cash the cheque myself.� So we all set off, the
+
+doctor, and the child�s father, and our friend and myself, and passed
+
+the rest of the night in my chambers; and next day, when we had
+
+breakfasted, went in a body to the bank. I gave in the cheque myself,
+
+and said I had every reason to believe it was a forgery. Not a bit of
+
+it. The cheque was genuine.�
+
+�Tut-tut!� said Mr. Utterson.
+
+�I see you feel as I do,� said Mr. Enfield. �Yes, it�s a bad story. For
+
+my man was a fellow that nobody could have to do with, a really
+
+damnable man; and the person that drew the cheque is the very pink of
+
+the proprieties, celebrated too, and (what makes it worse) one of your
+
+fellows who do what they call good. Blackmail, I suppose; an honest man
+
+paying through the nose for some of the capers of his youth. Black Mail
+
+House is what I call the place with the door, in consequence. Though
+
+even that, you know, is far from explaining all,� he added, and with
+
+the words fell into a vein of musing.
+
+From this he was recalled by Mr. Utterson asking rather suddenly: �And
+
+you don�t know if the drawer of the cheque lives there?�
+
+�A likely place, isn�t it?� returned Mr. Enfield. �But I happen to have
+
+noticed his address; he lives in some square or other.�
+
+�And you never asked about the�place with the door?� said Mr. Utterson.
+
+�No, sir; I had a delicacy,� was the reply. �I feel very strongly about
+
+putting questions; it partakes too much of the style of the day of
+
+judgment. You start a question, and it�s like starting a stone. You sit
+
+quietly on the top of a hill; and away the stone goes, starting others;
+
+and presently some bland old bird (the last you would have thought of)
+
+is knocked on the head in his own back garden and the family have to
+
+change their name. No sir, I make it a rule of mine: the more it looks
+
+like Queer Street, the less I ask.�
+
+�A very good rule, too,� said the lawyer.
+
+�But I have studied the place for myself,� continued Mr. Enfield. �It
+
+seems scarcely a house. There is no other door, and nobody goes in or
+
+out of that one but, once in a great while, the gentleman of my
+
+adventure. There are three windows looking on the court on the first
+
+floor; none below; the windows are always shut but they�re clean. And
+
+then there is a chimney which is generally smoking; so somebody must
+
+live there. And yet it�s not so sure; for the buildings are so packed
+
+together about the court, that it�s hard to say where one ends and
+
+another begins.�
+
+The pair walked on again for a while in silence; and then �Enfield,�
+
+said Mr. Utterson, �that�s a good rule of yours.�
+
+�Yes, I think it is,� returned Enfield.
+
+�But for all that,� continued the lawyer, �there�s one point I want to
+
+ask. I want to ask the name of that man who walked over the child.�
+
+�Well,� said Mr. Enfield, �I can�t see what harm it would do. It was a
+
+man of the name of Hyde.�
+
+�Hm,� said Mr. Utterson. �What sort of a man is he to see?�
+
+�He is not easy to describe. There is something wrong with his
+
+appearance; something displeasing, something down-right detestable. I
+
+never saw a man I so disliked, and yet I scarce know why. He must be
+
+deformed somewhere; he gives a strong feeling of deformity, although I
+
+couldn�t specify the point. He�s an extraordinary looking man, and yet
+
+I really can name nothing out of the way. No, sir; I can make no hand
+
+of it; I can�t describe him. And it�s not want of memory; for I declare
+
+I can see him this moment.�
+
+Mr. Utterson again walked some way in silence and obviously under a
+
+weight of consideration. �You are sure he used a key?� he inquired at
+
+last.
+
+�My dear sir...� began Enfield, surprised out of himself.
+
+�Yes, I know,� said Utterson; �I know it must seem strange. The fact
+
+is, if I do not ask you the name of the other party, it is because I
+
+know it already. You see, Richard, your tale has gone home. If you have
+
+been inexact in any point you had better correct it.�
+
+�I think you might have warned me,� returned the other with a touch of
+
+sullenness. �But I have been pedantically exact, as you call it. The
+
+fellow had a key; and what�s more, he has it still. I saw him use it
+
+not a week ago.�
+
+Mr. Utterson sighed deeply but said never a word; and the young man
+
+presently resumed. �Here is another lesson to say nothing,� said he. �I
+
+am ashamed of my long tongue. Let us make a bargain never to refer to
+
+this again.�
+
+�With all my heart,� said the lawyer. �I shake hands on that, Richard.�

+Chapter DR. LANYON�S NARRATIVE
+
+On the ninth of January, now four days ago, I received by the evening
+
+delivery a registered envelope, addressed in the hand of my colleague
+
+and old school companion, Henry Jekyll. I was a good deal surprised by
+
+this; for we were by no means in the habit of correspondence; I had
+
+seen the man, dined with him, indeed, the night before; and I could
+
+imagine nothing in our intercourse that should justify formality of
+
+registration. The contents increased my wonder; for this is how the
+
+letter ran:
+
+�10_th December_, 18�.
+
+�Dear Lanyon,�You are one of my oldest friends; and although we may
+
+have differed at times on scientific questions, I cannot remember, at
+
+least on my side, any break in our affection. There was never a day
+
+when, if you had said to me, �Jekyll, my life, my honour, my reason,
+
+depend upon you,� I would not have sacrificed my left hand to help you.
+
+Lanyon, my life, my honour, my reason, are all at your mercy; if you
+
+fail me to-night, I am lost. You might suppose, after this preface,
+
+that I am going to ask you for something dishonourable to grant. Judge
+
+for yourself.
+
+�I want you to postpone all other engagements for to-night�ay, even if
+
+you were summoned to the bedside of an emperor; to take a cab, unless
+
+your carriage should be actually at the door; and with this letter in
+
+your hand for consultation, to drive straight to my house. Poole, my
+
+butler, has his orders; you will find him waiting your arrival with a
+
+locksmith. The door of my cabinet is then to be forced; and you are to
+
+go in alone; to open the glazed press (letter E) on the left hand,
+
+breaking the lock if it be shut; and to draw out, _with all its
+
+contents as they stand_, the fourth drawer from the top or (which is
+
+the same thing) the third from the bottom. In my extreme distress of
+
+mind, I have a morbid fear of misdirecting you; but even if I am in
+
+error, you may know the right drawer by its contents: some powders, a
+
+phial and a paper book. This drawer I beg of you to carry back with you
+
+to Cavendish Square exactly as it stands.
+
+�That is the first part of the service: now for the second. You should
+
+be back, if you set out at once on the receipt of this, long before
+
+midnight; but I will leave you that amount of margin, not only in the
+
+fear of one of those obstacles that can neither be prevented nor
+
+foreseen, but because an hour when your servants are in bed is to be
+
+preferred for what will then remain to do. At midnight, then, I have to
+
+ask you to be alone in your consulting room, to admit with your own
+
+hand into the house a man who will present himself in my name, and to
+
+place in his hands the drawer that you will have brought with you from
+
+my cabinet. Then you will have played your part and earned my gratitude
+
+completely. Five minutes afterwards, if you insist upon an explanation,
+
+you will have understood that these arrangements are of capital
+
+importance; and that by the neglect of one of them, fantastic as they
+
+must appear, you might have charged your conscience with my death or
+
+the shipwreck of my reason.
+
+�Confident as I am that you will not trifle with this appeal, my heart
+
+sinks and my hand trembles at the bare thought of such a possibility.
+
+Think of me at this hour, in a strange place, labouring under a
+
+blackness of distress that no fancy can exaggerate, and yet well aware
+
+that, if you will but punctually serve me, my troubles will roll away
+
+like a story that is told. Serve me, my dear Lanyon and save
+
+�Your friend,
+
+�H.J.
+
+�P.S.�I had already sealed this up when a fresh terror struck upon my
+
+soul. It is possible that the post-office may fail me, and this letter
+
+not come into your hands until to-morrow morning. In that case, dear
+
+Lanyon, do my errand when it shall be most convenient for you in the
+
+course of the day; and once more expect my messenger at midnight. It
+
+may then already be too late; and if that night passes without event,
+
+you will know that you have seen the last of Henry Jekyll.�
+
+Upon the reading of this letter, I made sure my colleague was insane;
+
+but till that was proved beyond the possibility of doubt, I felt bound
+
+to do as he requested. The less I understood of this farrago, the less
+
+I was in a position to judge of its importance; and an appeal so worded
+
+could not be set aside without a grave responsibility. I rose
+
+accordingly from table, got into a hansom, and drove straight to
+
+Jekyll�s house. The butler was awaiting my arrival; he had received by
+
+the same post as mine a registered letter of instruction, and had sent
+
+at once for a locksmith and a carpenter. The tradesmen came while we
+
+were yet speaking; and we moved in a body to old Dr. Denman�s surgical
+
+theatre, from which (as you are doubtless aware) Jekyll�s private
+
+cabinet is most conveniently entered. The door was very strong, the
+
+lock excellent; the carpenter avowed he would have great trouble and
+
+have to do much damage, if force were to be used; and the locksmith was
+
+near despair. But this last was a handy fellow, and after two hour�s
+
+work, the door stood open. The press marked E was unlocked; and I took
+
+out the drawer, had it filled up with straw and tied in a sheet, and
+
+returned with it to Cavendish Square.
+
+Here I proceeded to examine its contents. The powders were neatly
+
+enough made up, but not with the nicety of the dispensing chemist; so
+
+that it was plain they were of Jekyll�s private manufacture; and when I
+
+opened one of the wrappers I found what seemed to me a simple
+
+crystalline salt of a white colour. The phial, to which I next turned
+
+my attention, might have been about half full of a blood-red liquor,
+
+which was highly pungent to the sense of smell and seemed to me to
+
+contain phosphorus and some volatile ether. At the other ingredients I
+
+could make no guess. The book was an ordinary version book and
+
+contained little but a series of dates. These covered a period of many
+
+years, but I observed that the entries ceased nearly a year ago and
+
+quite abruptly. Here and there a brief remark was appended to a date,
+
+usually no more than a single word: �double� occurring perhaps six
+
+times in a total of several hundred entries; and once very early in the
+
+list and followed by several marks of exclamation, �total failure!!!�
+
+All this, though it whetted my curiosity, told me little that was
+
+definite. Here were a phial of some salt, and the record of a series of
+
+experiments that had led (like too many of Jekyll�s investigations) to
+
+no end of practical usefulness. How could the presence of these
+
+articles in my house affect either the honour, the sanity, or the life
+
+of my flighty colleague? If his messenger could go to one place, why
+
+could he not go to another? And even granting some impediment, why was
+
+this gentleman to be received by me in secret? The more I reflected the
+
+more convinced I grew that I was dealing with a case of cerebral
+
+disease; and though I dismissed my servants to bed, I loaded an old
+
+revolver, that I might be found in some posture of self-defence.
+
+Twelve o�clock had scarce rung out over London, ere the knocker sounded
+
+very gently on the door. I went myself at the summons, and found a
+
+small man crouching against the pillars of the portico.
+
+�Are you come from Dr. Jekyll?� I asked.
+
+He told me �yes� by a constrained gesture; and when I had bidden him
+
+enter, he did not obey me without a searching backward glance into the
+
+darkness of the square. There was a policeman not far off, advancing
+
+with his bull�s eye open; and at the sight, I thought my visitor
+
+started and made greater haste.
+
+These particulars struck me, I confess, disagreeably; and as I followed
+
+him into the bright light of the consulting room, I kept my hand ready
+
+on my weapon. Here, at last, I had a chance of clearly seeing him. I
+
+had never set eyes on him before, so much was certain. He was small, as
+
+I have said; I was struck besides with the shocking expression of his
+
+face, with his remarkable combination of great muscular activity and
+
+great apparent debility of constitution, and�last but not least�with
+
+the odd, subjective disturbance caused by his neighbourhood. This bore
+
+some resemblance to incipient rigour, and was accompanied by a marked
+
+sinking of the pulse. At the time, I set it down to some idiosyncratic,
+
+personal distaste, and merely wondered at the acuteness of the
+
+symptoms; but I have since had reason to believe the cause to lie much
+
+deeper in the nature of man, and to turn on some nobler hinge than the
+
+principle of hatred.
+
+This person (who had thus, from the first moment of his entrance,
+
+struck in me what I can only describe as a disgustful curiosity) was
+
+dressed in a fashion that would have made an ordinary person laughable;
+
+his clothes, that is to say, although they were of rich and sober
+
+fabric, were enormously too large for him in every measurement�the
+
+trousers hanging on his legs and rolled up to keep them from the
+
+ground, the waist of the coat below his haunches, and the collar
+
+sprawling wide upon his shoulders. Strange to relate, this ludicrous
+
+accoutrement was far from moving me to laughter. Rather, as there was
+
+something abnormal and misbegotten in the very essence of the creature
+
+that now faced me�something seizing, surprising and revolting�this
+
+fresh disparity seemed but to fit in with and to reinforce it; so that
+
+to my interest in the man�s nature and character, there was added a
+
+curiosity as to his origin, his life, his fortune and status in the
+
+world.
+
+These observations, though they have taken so great a space to be set
+
+down in, were yet the work of a few seconds. My visitor was, indeed, on
+
+fire with sombre excitement.
+
+�Have you got it?� he cried. �Have you got it?� And so lively was his
+
+impatience that he even laid his hand upon my arm and sought to shake
+
+me.
+
+I put him back, conscious at his touch of a certain icy pang along my
+
+blood. �Come, sir,� said I. �You forget that I have not yet the
+
+pleasure of your acquaintance. Be seated, if you please.� And I showed
+
+him an example, and sat down myself in my customary seat and with as
+
+fair an imitation of my ordinary manner to a patient, as the lateness
+
+of the hour, the nature of my preoccupations, and the horror I had of
+
+my visitor, would suffer me to muster.
+
+�I beg your pardon, Dr. Lanyon,� he replied civilly enough. �What you
+
+say is very well founded; and my impatience has shown its heels to my
+
+politeness. I come here at the instance of your colleague, Dr. Henry
+
+Jekyll, on a piece of business of some moment; and I understood...� He
+
+paused and put his hand to his throat, and I could see, in spite of his
+
+collected manner, that he was wrestling against the approaches of the
+
+hysteria��I understood, a drawer...�
+
+But here I took pity on my visitor�s suspense, and some perhaps on my
+
+own growing curiosity.
+
+�There it is, sir,� said I, pointing to the drawer, where it lay on the
+
+floor behind a table and still covered with the sheet.
+
+He sprang to it, and then paused, and laid his hand upon his heart; I
+
+could hear his teeth grate with the convulsive action of his jaws; and
+
+his face was so ghastly to see that I grew alarmed both for his life
+
+and reason.
+
+�Compose yourself,� said I.
+
+He turned a dreadful smile to me, and as if with the decision of
+
+despair, plucked away the sheet. At sight of the contents, he uttered
+
+one loud sob of such immense relief that I sat petrified. And the next
+
+moment, in a voice that was already fairly well under control, �Have
+
+you a graduated glass?� he asked.
+
+I rose from my place with something of an effort and gave him what he
+
+asked.
+
+He thanked me with a smiling nod, measured out a few minims of the red
+
+tincture and added one of the powders. The mixture, which was at first
+
+of a reddish hue, began, in proportion as the crystals melted, to
+
+brighten in colour, to effervesce audibly, and to throw off small fumes
+
+of vapour. Suddenly and at the same moment, the ebullition ceased and
+
+the compound changed to a dark purple, which faded again more slowly to
+
+a watery green. My visitor, who had watched these metamorphoses with a
+
+keen eye, smiled, set down the glass upon the table, and then turned
+
+and looked upon me with an air of scrutiny.
+
+�And now,� said he, �to settle what remains. Will you be wise? will you
+
+be guided? will you suffer me to take this glass in my hand and to go
+
+forth from your house without further parley? or has the greed of
+
+curiosity too much command of you? Think before you answer, for it
+
+shall be done as you decide. As you decide, you shall be left as you
+
+were before, and neither richer nor wiser, unless the sense of service
+
+rendered to a man in mortal distress may be counted as a kind of riches
+
+of the soul. Or, if you shall so prefer to choose, a new province of
+
+knowledge and new avenues to fame and power shall be laid open to you,
+
+here, in this room, upon the instant; and your sight shall be blasted
+
+by a prodigy to stagger the unbelief of Satan.�
+
+�Sir,� said I, affecting a coolness that I was far from truly
+
+possessing, �you speak enigmas, and you will perhaps not wonder that I
+
+hear you with no very strong impression of belief. But I have gone too
+
+far in the way of inexplicable services to pause before I see the end.�
+
+�It is well,� replied my visitor. �Lanyon, you remember your vows: what
+
+follows is under the seal of our profession. And now, you who have so
+
+long been bound to the most narrow and material views, you who have
+
+denied the virtue of transcendental medicine, you who have derided your
+
+superiors�behold!�
+
+He put the glass to his lips and drank at one gulp. A cry followed; he
+
+reeled, staggered, clutched at the table and held on, staring with
+
+injected eyes, gasping with open mouth; and as I looked there came, I
+
+thought, a change�he seemed to swell�his face became suddenly black and
+
+the features seemed to melt and alter�and the next moment, I had sprung
+
+to my feet and leaped back against the wall, my arms raised to shield
+
+me from that prodigy, my mind submerged in terror.
+
+�O God!� I screamed, and �O God!� again and again; for there before my
+
+eyes�pale and shaken, and half fainting, and groping before him with
+
+his hands, like a man restored from death�there stood Henry Jekyll!
+
+What he told me in the next hour, I cannot bring my mind to set on
+
+paper. I saw what I saw, I heard what I heard, and my soul sickened at
+
+it; and yet now when that sight has faded from my eyes, I ask myself if
+
+I believe it, and I cannot answer. My life is shaken to its roots;
+
+sleep has left me; the deadliest terror sits by me at all hours of the
+
+day and night; and I feel that my days are numbered, and that I must
+
+die; and yet I shall die incredulous. As for the moral turpitude that
+
+man unveiled to me, even with tears of penitence, I cannot, even in
+
+memory, dwell on it without a start of horror. I will say but one
+
+thing, Utterson, and that (if you can bring your mind to credit it)
+
+will be more than enough. The creature who crept into my house that

+Chapter INCIDENT OF THE LETTER
+
+It was late in the afternoon, when Mr. Utterson found his way to Dr.
+
+Jekyll�s door, where he was at once admitted by Poole, and carried down
+
+by the kitchen offices and across a yard which had once been a garden,
+
+to the building which was indifferently known as the laboratory or
+
+dissecting rooms. The doctor had bought the house from the heirs of a
+
+celebrated surgeon; and his own tastes being rather chemical than
+
+anatomical, had changed the destination of the block at the bottom of
+
+the garden. It was the first time that the lawyer had been received in
+
+that part of his friend�s quarters; and he eyed the dingy, windowless
+
+structure with curiosity, and gazed round with a distasteful sense of
+
+strangeness as he crossed the theatre, once crowded with eager students
+
+and now lying gaunt and silent, the tables laden with chemical
+
+apparatus, the floor strewn with crates and littered with packing
+
+straw, and the light falling dimly through the foggy cupola. At the
+
+further end, a flight of stairs mounted to a door covered with red
+
+baize; and through this, Mr. Utterson was at last received into the
+
+doctor�s cabinet. It was a large room fitted round with glass presses,
+
+furnished, among other things, with a cheval-glass and a business
+
+table, and looking out upon the court by three dusty windows barred
+
+with iron. The fire burned in the grate; a lamp was set lighted on the
+
+chimney shelf, for even in the houses the fog began to lie thickly; and
+
+there, close up to the warmth, sat Dr. Jekyll, looking deathly sick. He
+
+did not rise to meet his visitor, but held out a cold hand and bade him
+
+welcome in a changed voice.
+
+�And now,� said Mr. Utterson, as soon as Poole had left them, �you have
+
+heard the news?�
+
+The doctor shuddered. �They were crying it in the square,� he said. �I
+
+heard them in my dining-room.�
+
+�One word,� said the lawyer. �Carew was my client, but so are you, and
+
+I want to know what I am doing. You have not been mad enough to hide
+
+this fellow?�
+
+�Utterson, I swear to God,� cried the doctor, �I swear to God I will
+
+never set eyes on him again. I bind my honour to you that I am done
+
+with him in this world. It is all at an end. And indeed he does not
+
+want my help; you do not know him as I do; he is safe, he is quite
+
+safe; mark my words, he will never more be heard of.�
+
+The lawyer listened gloomily; he did not like his friend�s feverish
+
+manner. �You seem pretty sure of him,� said he; �and for your sake, I
+
+hope you may be right. If it came to a trial, your name might appear.�
+
+�I am quite sure of him,� replied Jekyll; �I have grounds for certainty
+
+that I cannot share with any one. But there is one thing on which you
+
+may advise me. I have�I have received a letter; and I am at a loss
+
+whether I should show it to the police. I should like to leave it in
+
+your hands, Utterson; you would judge wisely, I am sure; I have so
+
+great a trust in you.�
+
+�You fear, I suppose, that it might lead to his detection?� asked the
+
+lawyer.
+
+�No,� said the other. �I cannot say that I care what becomes of Hyde; I
+
+am quite done with him. I was thinking of my own character, which this
+
+hateful business has rather exposed.�
+
+Utterson ruminated awhile; he was surprised at his friend�s
+
+selfishness, and yet relieved by it. �Well,� said he, at last, �let me
+
+see the letter.�
+
+The letter was written in an odd, upright hand and signed �Edward
+
+Hyde�: and it signified, briefly enough, that the writer�s benefactor,
+
+Dr. Jekyll, whom he had long so unworthily repaid for a thousand
+
+generosities, need labour under no alarm for his safety, as he had
+
+means of escape on which he placed a sure dependence. The lawyer liked
+
+this letter well enough; it put a better colour on the intimacy than he
+
+had looked for; and he blamed himself for some of his past suspicions.
+
+�Have you the envelope?� he asked.
+
+�I burned it,� replied Jekyll, �before I thought what I was about. But
+
+it bore no postmark. The note was handed in.�
+
+�Shall I keep this and sleep upon it?� asked Utterson.
+
+�I wish you to judge for me entirely,� was the reply. �I have lost
+
+confidence in myself.�
+
+�Well, I shall consider,� returned the lawyer. �And now one word more:
+
+it was Hyde who dictated the terms in your will about that
+
+disappearance?�
+
+The doctor seemed seized with a qualm of faintness; he shut his mouth
+
+tight and nodded.
+
+�I knew it,� said Utterson. �He meant to murder you. You had a fine
+
+escape.�
+
+�I have had what is far more to the purpose,� returned the doctor
+
+solemnly: �I have had a lesson�O God, Utterson, what a lesson I have
+
+had!� And he covered his face for a moment with his hands.
+
+On his way out, the lawyer stopped and had a word or two with Poole.
+
+�By the bye,� said he, �there was a letter handed in to-day: what was
+
+the messenger like?� But Poole was positive nothing had come except by
+
+post; �and only circulars by that,� he added.
+
+This news sent off the visitor with his fears renewed. Plainly the
+
+letter had come by the laboratory door; possibly, indeed, it had been
+
+written in the cabinet; and if that were so, it must be differently
+
+judged, and handled with the more caution. The newsboys, as he went,
+
+were crying themselves hoarse along the footways: �Special edition.
+
+Shocking murder of an M.P.� That was the funeral oration of one friend
+
+and client; and he could not help a certain apprehension lest the good
+
+name of another should be sucked down in the eddy of the scandal. It
+
+was, at least, a ticklish decision that he had to make; and
+
+self-reliant as he was by habit, he began to cherish a longing for
+
+advice. It was not to be had directly; but perhaps, he thought, it
+
+might be fished for.
+
+Presently after, he sat on one side of his own hearth, with Mr. Guest,
+
+his head clerk, upon the other, and midway between, at a nicely
+
+calculated distance from the fire, a bottle of a particular old wine
+
+that had long dwelt unsunned in the foundations of his house. The fog
+
+still slept on the wing above the drowned city, where the lamps
+
+glimmered like carbuncles; and through the muffle and smother of these
+
+fallen clouds, the procession of the town�s life was still rolling in
+
+through the great arteries with a sound as of a mighty wind. But the
+
+room was gay with firelight. In the bottle the acids were long ago
+
+resolved; the imperial dye had softened with time, as the colour grows
+
+richer in stained windows; and the glow of hot autumn afternoons on
+
+hillside vineyards, was ready to be set free and to disperse the fogs
+
+of London. Insensibly the lawyer melted. There was no man from whom he
+
+kept fewer secrets than Mr. Guest; and he was not always sure that he
+
+kept as many as he meant. Guest had often been on business to the
+
+doctor�s; he knew Poole; he could scarce have failed to hear of Mr.
+
+Hyde�s familiarity about the house; he might draw conclusions: was it
+
+not as well, then, that he should see a letter which put that mystery
+
+to right? and above all since Guest, being a great student and critic
+
+of handwriting, would consider the step natural and obliging? The
+
+clerk, besides, was a man of counsel; he could scarce read so strange a
+
+document without dropping a remark; and by that remark Mr. Utterson
+
+might shape his future course.
+
+�This is a sad business about Sir Danvers,� he said.
+
+�Yes, sir, indeed. It has elicited a great deal of public feeling,�
+
+returned Guest. �The man, of course, was mad.�
+
+�I should like to hear your views on that,� replied Utterson. �I have a
+
+document here in his handwriting; it is between ourselves, for I scarce
+
+know what to do about it; it is an ugly business at the best. But there
+
+it is; quite in your way: a murderer�s autograph.�
+
+Guest�s eyes brightened, and he sat down at once and studied it with
+
+passion. �No sir,� he said: �not mad; but it is an odd hand.�
+
+�And by all accounts a very odd writer,� added the lawyer.
+
+Just then the servant entered with a note.
+
+�Is that from Dr. Jekyll, sir?� inquired the clerk. �I thought I knew
+
+the writing. Anything private, Mr. Utterson?�
+
+�Only an invitation to dinner. Why? Do you want to see it?�
+
+�One moment. I thank you, sir;� and the clerk laid the two sheets of
+
+paper alongside and sedulously compared their contents. �Thank you,
+
+sir,� he said at last, returning both; �it�s a very interesting
+
+autograph.�
+
+There was a pause, during which Mr. Utterson struggled with himself.
+
+�Why did you compare them, Guest?� he inquired suddenly.
+
+�Well, sir,� returned the clerk, �there�s a rather singular
+
+resemblance; the two hands are in many points identical: only
+
+differently sloped.�
+
+�Rather quaint,� said Utterson.
+
+�It is, as you say, rather quaint,� returned Guest.
+
+�I wouldn�t speak of this note, you know,� said the master.
+
+�No, sir,� said the clerk. �I understand.�
+
+But no sooner was Mr. Utterson alone that night, than he locked the
+
+note into his safe, where it reposed from that time forward. �What!� he
+
+thought. �Henry Jekyll forge for a murderer!� And his blood ran cold in
+
+his veins.

+Chapter INCIDENT OF DR. LANYON
+
+Time ran on; thousands of pounds were offered in reward, for the death
+
+of Sir Danvers was resented as a public injury; but Mr. Hyde had
+
+disappeared out of the ken of the police as though he had never
+
+existed. Much of his past was unearthed, indeed, and all disreputable:
+
+tales came out of the man�s cruelty, at once so callous and violent; of
+
+his vile life, of his strange associates, of the hatred that seemed to
+
+have surrounded his career; but of his present whereabouts, not a
+
+whisper. From the time he had left the house in Soho on the morning of
+
+the murder, he was simply blotted out; and gradually, as time drew on,
+
+Mr. Utterson began to recover from the hotness of his alarm, and to
+
+grow more at quiet with himself. The death of Sir Danvers was, to his
+
+way of thinking, more than paid for by the disappearance of Mr. Hyde.
+
+Now that that evil influence had been withdrawn, a new life began for
+
+Dr. Jekyll. He came out of his seclusion, renewed relations with his
+
+friends, became once more their familiar guest and entertainer; and
+
+whilst he had always been known for charities, he was now no less
+
+distinguished for religion. He was busy, he was much in the open air,
+
+he did good; his face seemed to open and brighten, as if with an inward
+
+consciousness of service; and for more than two months, the doctor was
+
+at peace.
+
+On the 8th of January Utterson had dined at the doctor�s with a small
+
+party; Lanyon had been there; and the face of the host had looked from
+
+one to the other as in the old days when the trio were inseparable
+
+friends. On the 12th, and again on the 14th, the door was shut against
+
+the lawyer. �The doctor was confined to the house,� Poole said, �and
+
+saw no one.� On the 15th, he tried again, and was again refused; and
+
+having now been used for the last two months to see his friend almost
+
+daily, he found this return of solitude to weigh upon his spirits. The
+
+fifth night he had in Guest to dine with him; and the sixth he betook
+
+himself to Dr. Lanyon�s.
+
+There at least he was not denied admittance; but when he came in, he
+
+was shocked at the change which had taken place in the doctor�s
+
+appearance. He had his death-warrant written legibly upon his face. The
+
+rosy man had grown pale; his flesh had fallen away; he was visibly
+
+balder and older; and yet it was not so much these tokens of a swift
+
+physical decay that arrested the lawyer�s notice, as a look in the eye
+
+and quality of manner that seemed to testify to some deep-seated terror
+
+of the mind. It was unlikely that the doctor should fear death; and yet
+
+that was what Utterson was tempted to suspect. �Yes,� he thought; �he
+
+is a doctor, he must know his own state and that his days are counted;
+
+and the knowledge is more than he can bear.� And yet when Utterson
+
+remarked on his ill looks, it was with an air of great firmness that
+
+Lanyon declared himself a doomed man.
+
+�I have had a shock,� he said, �and I shall never recover. It is a
+
+question of weeks. Well, life has been pleasant; I liked it; yes, sir,
+
+I used to like it. I sometimes think if we knew all, we should be more
+
+glad to get away.�
+
+�Jekyll is ill, too,� observed Utterson. �Have you seen him?�
+
+But Lanyon�s face changed, and he held up a trembling hand. �I wish to
+
+see or hear no more of Dr. Jekyll,� he said in a loud, unsteady voice.
+
+�I am quite done with that person; and I beg that you will spare me any
+
+allusion to one whom I regard as dead.�
+
+�Tut, tut!� said Mr. Utterson; and then after a considerable pause,
+
+�Can�t I do anything?� he inquired. �We are three very old friends,
+
+Lanyon; we shall not live to make others.�
+
+�Nothing can be done,� returned Lanyon; �ask himself.�
+
+�He will not see me,� said the lawyer.
+
+�I am not surprised at that,� was the reply. �Some day, Utterson, after
+
+I am dead, you may perhaps come to learn the right and wrong of this. I
+
+cannot tell you. And in the meantime, if you can sit and talk with me
+
+of other things, for God�s sake, stay and do so; but if you cannot keep
+
+clear of this accursed topic, then in God�s name, go, for I cannot bear
+
+it.�
+
+As soon as he got home, Utterson sat down and wrote to Jekyll,
+
+complaining of his exclusion from the house, and asking the cause of
+
+this unhappy break with Lanyon; and the next day brought him a long
+
+answer, often very pathetically worded, and sometimes darkly mysterious
+
+in drift. The quarrel with Lanyon was incurable. �I do not blame our
+
+old friend,� Jekyll wrote, �but I share his view that we must never
+
+meet. I mean from henceforth to lead a life of extreme seclusion; you
+
+must not be surprised, nor must you doubt my friendship, if my door is
+
+often shut even to you. You must suffer me to go my own dark way. I
+
+have brought on myself a punishment and a danger that I cannot name. If
+
+I am the chief of sinners, I am the chief of sufferers also. I could
+
+not think that this earth contained a place for sufferings and terrors
+
+so unmanning; and you can do but one thing, Utterson, to lighten this
+
+destiny, and that is to respect my silence.� Utterson was amazed; the
+
+dark influence of Hyde had been withdrawn, the doctor had returned to
+
+his old tasks and amities; a week ago, the prospect had smiled with
+
+every promise of a cheerful and an honoured age; and now in a moment,
+
+friendship, and peace of mind, and the whole tenor of his life were
+
+wrecked. So great and unprepared a change pointed to madness; but in
+
+view of Lanyon�s manner and words, there must lie for it some deeper
+
+ground.
+
+A week afterwards Dr. Lanyon took to his bed, and in something less
+
+than a fortnight he was dead. The night after the funeral, at which he
+
+had been sadly affected, Utterson locked the door of his business room,
+
+and sitting there by the light of a melancholy candle, drew out and set
+
+before him an envelope addressed by the hand and sealed with the seal
+
+of his dead friend. �PRIVATE: for the hands of G. J. Utterson ALONE,
+
+and in case of his predecease _to be destroyed unread_,� so it was
+
+emphatically superscribed; and the lawyer dreaded to behold the
+
+contents. �I have buried one friend to-day,� he thought: �what if this
+
+should cost me another?� And then he condemned the fear as a
+
+disloyalty, and broke the seal. Within there was another enclosure,
+
+likewise sealed, and marked upon the cover as �not to be opened till
+
+the death or disappearance of Dr. Henry Jekyll.� Utterson could not
+
+trust his eyes. Yes, it was disappearance; here again, as in the mad
+
+will which he had long ago restored to its author, here again were the
+
+idea of a disappearance and the name of Henry Jekyll bracketted. But in
+
+the will, that idea had sprung from the sinister suggestion of the man
+
+Hyde; it was set there with a purpose all too plain and horrible.
+
+Written by the hand of Lanyon, what should it mean? A great curiosity
+
+came on the trustee, to disregard the prohibition and dive at once to
+
+the bottom of these mysteries; but professional honour and faith to his
+
+dead friend were stringent obligations; and the packet slept in the
+
+inmost corner of his private safe.
+
+It is one thing to mortify curiosity, another to conquer it; and it may
+
+be doubted if, from that day forth, Utterson desired the society of his
+
+surviving friend with the same eagerness. He thought of him kindly; but
+
+his thoughts were disquieted and fearful. He went to call indeed; but
+
+he was perhaps relieved to be denied admittance; perhaps, in his heart,
+
+he preferred to speak with Poole upon the doorstep and surrounded by
+
+the air and sounds of the open city, rather than to be admitted into
+
+that house of voluntary bondage, and to sit and speak with its
+
+inscrutable recluse. Poole had, indeed, no very pleasant news to
+
+communicate. The doctor, it appeared, now more than ever confined
+
+himself to the cabinet over the laboratory, where he would sometimes
+
+even sleep; he was out of spirits, he had grown very silent, he did not
+
+read; it seemed as if he had something on his mind. Utterson became so
+
+used to the unvarying character of these reports, that he fell off
+
+little by little in the frequency of his visits.
+
