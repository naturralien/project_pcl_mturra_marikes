Part 2:
a) We chose NRCLex as sentiment analysis tool. Since we are only focusing on
the sentiment analysis for Part 2 and already did the NER in Part 1, we do not need to use
spaCy. spaCy would also be less accurate than the other two options.
Flair would also be a good option in our case, but we chose NRCLex because it is easier to use and
we do not need to train a model for our specific case. Also, because we are working with three different books.
One of the downsides of using NRCLex is that it does not support foreign languages. Our books
should all be in English, so it should not cause any problems in our case.
