Identifying Named Entities and Sentiments by Chapter using grep commands

For the named entities we used the following grep commands to extract for each chapter of each book:
As names in english are usually capitalised we used this feature to extract them from the text using regular expressions.

Initial grep commands to start the extraction that were useful to some extent, but we need to filter out capitalised words that are not names,
the inital thought was that names are usually longer than 3 characters, which is not always the case of course. Then there was also the problem
with words like 'This' or 'What' as they are longer than 3 characters too but are not names. So we need to filter out these words as well.

Frankenstein:
gets all words starting with upper case in chapters:
 grep -Po --color=always '^[A-Z]\w[{3,}\s' Chapter_*.txt | uniq

Dracula:
gets all words starting with upper case in chapters:
 grep -Po --color=always '^[A-Z]\w{3,}\s' CHAPTER_*.txt | uniq

Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde:
gets all words starting with upper case in chapters:
 grep -Po --color=always '^[A-Z]\w{3,}\s' Chapter_* | uniq




To identify Sentiments in the Chapters we used the following process:
The sentiment is usually described with positive or negative words, so we used this feature to extract them from the text using regular expressions.
As the text does not include any POS tags we could not use this feature in our grep commands.
Additionally, we also counted the appearances of the adjectives in the text to get a better understanding of the sentiment.
The more counts of positive words the more positive the sentiment is and vice versa.

positive words grep commands:
good appears 3 times: grep -Po --color=always '^good' Chapter_*.txt

negative words grep commands:
dark appears 6 times: grep -Po --color=always '^bad' Chapter_*.txt
