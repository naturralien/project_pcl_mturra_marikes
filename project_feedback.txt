Mattia: With all due respect, while it covered some interesting topics, I will primarily remember the project as a tedium. A lot of its content was not covered sufficiently
in our lectures and while our tutors did a good job in the sessions on friday, it stil felt like we were ill-prepared for this task. The workload was also high, and the assigment
day was set on the 26th of December, which, quite frankly, is bordering on sadism. 
Not to say that all was in vain. Working with Spacy was very interesting (which is why I struggle to understand the focus on nltk in lectures),
the splitting of the book into chapters was tricky, but rewarding and getting to know applied NER and sentiment analysis was very exciting too.
But as I said above, I find it likely that the (in my subjective opinion) lack of connection between the lectures and this exercise led to many students being overwhelmed and having to
rely on ChatGPT in order to achieve a satisfactory solution. 
To summarise, while I found some aspects of the exercise are to be criticised, I still think that I could take away a decent amount of learnings from the project.
